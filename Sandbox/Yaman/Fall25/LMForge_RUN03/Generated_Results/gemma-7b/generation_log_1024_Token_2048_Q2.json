That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \njust powers from the consent of the governed.… \n \n \nThe natural-law school has been very influential in American legal thinking. The idea that certain rights, \nfor example, are “unalienable” (as expressed in the Declaration of Independence and in the writings of \nJohn Locke) is consistent with this view of the law. Individuals may have “God-given” or “natural” rights \nthat government cannot legitimately take away. Government only by consent of the governed is a natural \noutgrowth of this view. \n \nCivil disobedience—in the tradition of Henry Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, or Martin Luther King Jr.—\nbecomes a matter of morality over “unnatural” law. For example, in his “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” \nMartin Luther King Jr. claims that obeying an unjust law is not moral and that deliberately disobeying an \nunjust law is in fact a moral act that expresses “the highest respect for law”: “An individual who breaks a \nlaw that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to \narouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for \nlaw.…One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the \npenalty.” [2] \nLegal positivists, on the other hand, would say that we cannot know with real confidence what “natural” \nlaw or “universal” law is. In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge? (A \npriori means “existing in the mind prior to and independent of experience.”) Or is the statement about \nequality a matter of faith or belief, not really provable either scientifically or rationally? The dialogue \nbetween natural-law theorists and more empirically oriented theories of “what law is” will raise similar \nquestions. In this book, we will focus mostly on the law as it is, but not without also raising questions \nabout what it could or should be. \n \nOther Schools of Legal Thought \nThe historical school of law believes that societies should base their legal decisions today on the examples \nof the past. Precedent would be more important than moral arguments. \n \nThe legal realist school flourished in the 1920s and 1930s as a reaction to the historical school. Legal \nrealists pointed out that because life and society are constantly changing, certain laws and doctrines have \nto be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence.",

In a general way, differentiate contract law from tort law. \n2. Consider the role of law in supporting ethical norms in our society. \n3. Understand the differing roles of state law and federal law in the US legal system. \n4. Know the difference between criminal cases and civil cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n13 \n \nMost of what we discuss in this book is positive law—US positive law in particular. We will also \nconsider the laws and legal systems of other nations. But first, it will be useful to cover some basic \nconcepts and distinctions. \n \nLaw: The Moral Minimums in a Democratic Society \nThe law does not correct (or claim to correct) every wrong that occurs in society. At a minimum, it aims to \ncurb the worst kind of wrongs, the kinds of wrongs that violate what might be called the “moral \nminimums” that a community demands of its members. These include not only violations of criminal law \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\") but also torts (see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\") and broken \npromises (see Chapter 8 \"Contracts\"). Thus it may be wrong to refuse to return a phone call from a friend, \nbut that wrong will not result in a viable lawsuit against you. But if a phone (or the Internet) is used to \nlibel or slander someone, a tort has been committed, and the law may allow the defamed person to be \ncompensated. \nThere is a strong association between what we generally think of as ethical behavior and what the laws \nrequire and provide. For example, contract law upholds society’s sense that promises—in general—should \nbe kept. Promise-breaking is seen as unethical. The law provides remedies for broken promises (in breach \nof contract cases) but not for all broken promises; some excuses are accepted when it would be reasonable \nto do so. For tort law, harming others is considered unethical. If people are not restrained by law from \nharming one another, orderly society would be undone, leading to anarchy. Tort law provides for \ncompensation when serious injuries or harms occur. As for property law issues, we generally believe that \nprivate ownership of property is socially useful and generally desirable, and it is generally protected (with \nsome exceptions) by laws. You can’t throw a party at my house without my permission, but my right to do \nwhatever I want on my own property may be limited by law; I can’t, without the public’s permission, \noperate an incinerator on my property and burn heavy metals, as toxic ash may be deposited throughout \nthe neighborhood. \n \nThe Common Law: Property, Torts, and Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n14 \nEven before legislatures met to make rules for society, disputes happened and judges decided them. In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy. Thus the use of precedent in common-law cases \ncame into being, and a doctrine of stare decisis (pronounced STAR-ay-de-SIGH-sus) became accepted \nin English courts. Stare decisis means, in Latin, “let the decision stand.” \n \nMost judicial decisions that don’t apply legislative acts (known as statutes) will involve one of three areas \nof law—property, contract, or tort. Property law deals with the rights and duties of those who can legally \nown land (real property), how that ownership can be legally confirmed and protected, how property can \nbe bought and sold, what the rights of tenants (renters) are, and what the various kinds of “estates” in \nland are (e.g., fee simple, life estate, future interest, easements, or rights of way). Contract law deals with \nwhat kinds of promises courts should enforce. For example, should courts enforce a contract where one of \nthe parties was intoxicated, underage, or insane? Should courts enforce a contract where one of the \nparties seemed to have an unfair advantage? What kind of contracts would have to be in writing to be \nenforced by courts? Tort law deals with the types of cases that involve some kind of harm and or injury \nbetween the plaintiff and the defendant when no contract exists. Thus if you are libeled or a competitor \nlies about your product, your remedy would be in tort, not contract.",

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations).

Describe the different sources of law in the US legal system and the principal institutions that create those \nlaws. \n2. Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty, and vice versa. \n3. Explain why the Constitution is “prior” and has priority over the legislative acts of a majority, whether in the \nUS Congress or in a state legislature. \n4. Describe the origins of the common-law system and what common law means. \n \n \nSources of Law \nIn the United States today, there are numerous sources of law. The main ones are (1) constitutions—both \nstate and federal, (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions. In addition, chief \nexecutives (the president and the various governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law. \n \nIn international legal systems, sources of law include treaties (agreements between states or countries) \nand what is known as customary international law (usually consisting of judicial decisions from national \ncourt systems where parties from two or more nations are in a dispute). \n \nAs you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state law may conflict with a federal law, or a \nfederal law might be contrary to an international obligation. One nation’s law may provide one \nsubstantive rule, while another nation’s law may provide a different, somewhat contrary rule to apply. Not \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n20 \nall laws, in other words, are created equal. To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives",

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society.

For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and obligations made later through the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nwould override previous federal or state statutes. \n \nOne example of treaty obligations overriding, or taking priority over, federal statutes was the tuna-\ndolphin dispute between the United States and Mexico. The Marine Mammal Protection Act amendments \nin 1988 spelled out certain protections for dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, and the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n25 \nbegan refusing to allow the importation of tuna that were caught using “dolphin-unfriendly” methods \n(such as purse seining). This was challenged at a GATT dispute panel in Switzerland, and the United \nStates lost. The discussion continued at the WTO under its dispute resolution process. In short, US \nenvironmental statutes can be ruled contrary to US treaty obligations. \n \nUnder most treaties, the United States can withdraw, or take back, any voluntary limitation on its \nsovereignty; participation in treaties is entirely elective. That is, the United States may “unbind” itself \nwhenever it chooses. But for practical purposes, some limitations on sovereignty may be good for the \nnation. The argument goes something like this: if free trade in general helps the United States, then it \nmakes some sense to be part of a system that promotes free trade; and despite some temporary setbacks, \nthe WTO decision process will (it is hoped) provide far more benefits than losses in the long run. This \nargument invokes utilitarian theory (that the best policy does the greatest good overall for society) and \nDavid Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage. \n \nUltimately, whether the United States remains a supporter of free trade and continues to participate as a \nleader in the WTO will depend upon citizens electing leaders who support the process. Had Ross Perot \nbeen elected in 1992, for example, NAFTA would have been politically (and legally) dead during his term \nof office. \n \nCauses of Action, Precedent, and Stare Decisis \nNo matter how wrong someone’s actions may seem to you, the only wrongs you can right in a court are \nthose that can be tied to one or more causes of action. Positive law is full of cases, treaties, statutes, \nregulations, and constitutional provisions that can be made into a cause of action. If you have an \nagreement with Harold Hill that he will purchase seventy-six trombones from you and he fails to pay for \nthem after you deliver, you will probably feel wronged, but a court will only act favorably on your \ncomplaint if you can show that his behavior gives you a cause of action based on some part of your state’s \ncontract law. This case would give you a cause of action under the law of most states; unless Harold Hill \nhad some legal excuse recognized by the applicable state’s contract law—such as his legal incompetence, \nhis being less than eighteen years of age, his being drunk at the time the agreement was made, or his claim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n26 \nthat the instruments were trumpets rather than trombones or that they were delivered too late to be of use \nto him—you could expect to recover some compensation for his breaching of your agreement with him. \n \nAn old saying in the law is that the law does not deal in trifles, or unimportant issues (in Latin, de minimis \nnon curat lex). Not every wrong you may suffer in life will be a cause to bring a court action. If you are \nstood up for a Saturday night date and feel embarrassed or humiliated, you cannot recover anything in a \ncourt of law in the United States, as there is no cause of action (no basis in the positive law) that you can \nuse in your complaint. If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases.

How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in.

(1988 ed., Supp. III). \n \n \n \nI \n \nTeresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from \nApril 1985 until October 1987. Charles Hardy was Forklift’s president. \nThe Magistrate found that, throughout Harris’ time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of \nher gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendoes. Hardy told Harris on \nseveral occasions, in the presence of other employees, “You’re a woman, what do you know” and “We \nneed a man as the rental manager”; at least once, he told her she was “a dumbass woman.” Again in \nfront of others, he suggested that the two of them “go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris’s] \nraise.” Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants \npocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick \nthe objects up. He made sexual innuendoes about Harris’ and other women’s clothing. \n \nIn mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised \nthat Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would \nstop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job. But in early September, Hardy began \nanew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift’s customers, he asked her, again in \nfront of other employees, “What did you do, promise the guy…some [sex] Saturday night?” On \nOctober 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n34 \nHarris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy’s conduct had created an abusive work environment \nfor her because of her gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, \nadopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be “a close case,” but held \nthat Hardy’s conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy’s \ncomments “offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman,” but that they were not “so \nsevere as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris’s] psychological well-being. A reasonable woman \nmanager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not \nhave risen to the level of interfering with that person’s work performance. \n \n“Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.…Although \nHardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working \nenvironment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris].” \n \nIn focusing on the employee’s psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit \nprecedent. See Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co., 805 F.2d 611, 620 (CA6 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. \n1041, 95 L. Ed. 2d 823, 107 S. Ct. 1983 (1987).

(This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale. Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct",

Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known. Often we \nremember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts. For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants. As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value \nthat when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover. Shell, Nike, and other companies have \ndiscovered that there is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention \nto business ethics often comes at a serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles. Customers \nhave had near-death experiences from sudden acceleration; they would be driving along a highway at normal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n60 \nspeed when suddenly the car would begin to accelerate, and efforts to stop the acceleration by braking fail to \nwork. Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal. In fact, there appears to be a \npossible flaw in both models, perhaps in a semiconductor chip, that makes sudden acceleration happen. \nInterference by floor mats and poorly designed gas pedals do not seem to be the problem. \nIt is voluntary to report these incidents to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA), \nbut the company decides that it will wait awhile and see if there are more complaints. Recalling the two \nmodels so that local dealers and their mechanics could examine them is also an option, but it would be \nextremely costly. Company executives are aware that quarterly and annual profit-and-loss statements, on \nwhich their bonuses depend, could be decisively worse with a recall. They decide that on a cost-benefit basis, \nit makes more sense to wait until there are more accidents and more data. After a hundred or more accidents \nand nearly fifteen fatalities, the company institutes a selective recall, still not notifying NHTSA, which has its \nown experts and the authority to order XYZ to do a full recall of all affected models. \nExperts have advised XYZ that standard failure-analysis methodology requires that the company obtain \nabsolutely every XYZ vehicle that has experienced sudden acceleration, using microscopic analysis of all critical \ncomponents of the electronic system. The company does not wish to take that advice, as it would be—as one \ntop executive put it—“too time-consuming and expensive.” \n1.

Understand one model for ethical decision making: a process to arrive at the most ethical option for an \nindividual or a business organization, using a virtue ethics approach combined with some elements of \nstakeholder analysis and utilitarianism. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Model \nOnce you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical judgment, Michael Josephson would first \nhave you ask as many questions as are necessary to get a full background on the relevant facts. Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust. Demonstrate integrity—stand up for what you believe, walk the walk as well \nas talking the talk; be what you seem to be; show commitment and courage. Be loyal—stand by \nyour family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that \ncomes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your \nprinciples just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is \nwrong. Keep promises—keep your word, honor your commitments, and pay your debts; return \nwhat you borrow. \n \nRespect: Judge people on their merits, not their appearance; be courteous, polite, appreciative, \nand accepting of differences; respect others’ right to make decisions about their own lives; don’t \nabuse, demean, mistreat anyone; don’t use, manipulate, exploit, or take advantage of others. \n \nResponsibility: Be accountable—think about the consequences on yourself and others likely to \nbe affected before you act; be reliable; perform your duties; take responsibility for the \nconsequences of your choices; set a good example and don’t make excuses or take credit for other \npeople’s work. Pursue excellence: Do your best, don’t quit easily, persevere, be diligent, make all \nyou do worthy of pride. Exercise self-restraint—be disciplined, know the difference between what \nyou have a right to do and what is right to do. \n \nFairness: Treat all people fairly, be open-minded; listen; consider opposing viewpoints; be \nconsistent; use only appropriate considerations; don’t let personal feelings improperly interfere \nwith decisions; don’t take unfair advantage of mistakes; don’t take more than your fair share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n63 \nCaring: Show you care about others through kindness, caring, sharing, compassion, and \nempathy; treat others the way you want to be treated; don’t be selfish, mean, cruel, or insensitive \nto others’ feelings. \n \nCitizenship: Play by the rules, obey laws; do your share, respect authority, stay informed, vote, \nprotect your neighbors, pay your taxes; be charitable, help your community; protect the \nenvironment, conserve resources. \n \n \nWhen individuals and organizations confront ethical problems, the core values decision model offered by \nJosephson generally works well (1) to clarify the gains and losses of the various stakeholders, which then",

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities?

He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes.

But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be \naffected by corporate decisions. \n \nAccording to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention \nnot only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community. Public perception of a \ncompany’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, \nwhatever the short-term successes or profits may be. A socially responsible corporation is likely to \nconsider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

The \ncourt there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction \nover Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and \naccidents in New Mexico. Why would the Texas judge do that? \n(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make \na decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law \nstandards. For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the \nUniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court \ndecides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other. \nIn Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New \nMexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or \nhow much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies. Because both were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n96 \nunder the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New \nMexico law. \n(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court? \n(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or \nsympathetic to the “local” plaintiff. \n(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured \njudge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area). \n(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done? \n(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court. \n(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the \ncase unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy \nis less than $75,000. \n \n \nTo better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example. Wile E. Coyote wants a \nfederal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on \nstate law. Mr. Coyote’s attorney wants to “make a federal case” out of it, thinking that the jurors in the \nfederal district court’s jury pool will understand the case better and be more likely to deliver a “high value” \nverdict for Mr. Coyote. Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware \nand has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The federal court in Arizona can hear and \ndecide Mr. Coyote’s case (i.e., it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of diversity of \ncitizenship. If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of Acme’s defective products while chasing a roadrunner in \nArizona, the federal district court judge would hear his action—using federal procedural law—and decide \nthe case based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability. \n \nBut now change the facts only slightly: Acme is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of",

There is no federal products-liability law that could be used as a cause of \naction. They are most likely suing the defendants using products-liability law based on common-law \nnegligence or common-law strict liability law, as found in state court cases.

They bought the vehicle in New York from a New York–based retailer. None of the other \ndefendants is from Oklahoma. \n \nThey file in an Oklahoma state court, but how will they (their attorney or the court) know if the state court \nhas subject matter jurisdiction? Unless the case is required to be in a federal court (i.e., unless the federal \ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction over this kind of case), any state court system will have subject matter \njurisdiction, including Oklahoma’s state court system. But if their claim is for a significant amount of \nmoney, they cannot file in small claims court, probate court, or any court in Oklahoma that does not have \nstatutory jurisdiction over their claim.

Judicial decision making in the \ncontext of litigation (civil lawsuits) is a distinctive form of dispute resolution. \n \nFirst, to get the attention of a court, the plaintiff must make a claim based on existing laws. Second, courts \ndo not reach out for cases. Cases are brought to them, usually when an attorney files a case with the right \ncourt in the right way, following the various laws that govern all civil procedures in a state or in the federal \nsystem. (Most US states’ procedural laws are similar to the federal procedural code.) \n \nOnce at the court, the case will proceed through various motions (motions to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction, for example, or insufficient service of process), the proofs (submission of evidence), and the \narguments (debate about the meaning of the evidence and the law) of contesting parties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n99 \nThis is at the heart of the adversary system, in which those who oppose each other may attack the other’s \ncase through proofs and cross-examination. Every person in the United States who wishes to take a case \nto court is entitled to hire a lawyer. The lawyer works for his client, not the court, and serves him as an \nadvocate, or supporter. The client’s goal is to persuade the court of the accuracy and justness of his \nposition. The lawyer’s duty is to shape the evidence and the argument—the line of reasoning about the \nevidence—to advance his client’s cause and persuade the court of its rightness. The lawyer for the \nopposing party will be doing the same thing, of course, for her client. The judge (or, if one is sitting, the \njury) must sort out the facts and reach a decision from this cross-fire of evidence and argument. \n \nThe method of adjudication—the act of making an order or judgment—has several important features. \nFirst, it focuses the conflicting issues. Other, secondary concerns are minimized or excluded altogether. \nRelevance is a key concept in any trial. The judge is required to decide the questions presented at the trial, \nnot to talk about related matters. Second, adjudication requires that the judge’s decision be reasoned, and \nthat is why judges write opinions explaining their decisions (an opinion may be omitted when the verdict \ncomes from a jury). Third, the judge’s decision must not only be reasoned but also be responsive to the \ncase presented: the judge is not free to say that the case is unimportant and that he therefore will ignore it. \nUnlike other branches of government that are free to ignore problems pressing upon them, judges must \ndecide cases. (For example, a legislature need not enact a law, no matter how many people petition it to do \nso.) Fourth, the court must respond in a certain way. The judge must pay attention to the parties’ \narguments and his decision must result from their proofs and arguments. Evidence that is not presented \nand legal arguments that are not made cannot be the basis for what the judge decides. Also, judges are \nbound by standards of weighing evidence: the burden of proof in a civil case is generally a “preponderance \nof the evidence.” \n \nIn all cases, the plaintiff—the party making a claim and initiating the lawsuit (in a criminal case the \nplaintiff is the prosecution)—has the burden of proving his case. If he fails to prove it, the defendant—the \nparty being sued or prosecuted—will win. \nCriminal prosecutions carry the most rigorous burden of proof: the government must prove its case \nagainst the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, even if it seems very likely that the defendant \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n100 \ncommitted the crime, as long as there remains some reasonable doubt—perhaps he was not clearly \nidentified as the culprit, perhaps he has an alibi that could be legitimate—the jury must vote to acquit \nrather than convict. \n \nBy contrast, the burden of proof in ordinary civil cases—those dealing with contracts, personal injuries, \nand most of the cases in this book—is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the plaintiff’s \nevidence must outweigh whatever evidence the defendant can muster that casts doubts on the plaintiff’s \nclaim. This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they \ntalk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the \npreponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant \nevidence. \n \nAdjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts.

Unless the defendant had some significant contact with the plaintiff’s state, the plaintiff may \nindeed have to. For instance, suppose a traveler from Maine stopped at a roadside diner in Montana and \nordered a slice of homemade pie that was tainted and caused him to be sick. The traveler may not simply \nreturn home and mail the diner a notice that he is suing it in a Maine court. But if out-of-state defendants \nhave some contact with the plaintiff’s state of residence, there might be grounds to bring them within the \njurisdiction of the plaintiff’s state courts. In Burger King v. Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 \"Cases\", the federal \ncourt in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee. \n \nAgain, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction \nover each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made. Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness—and the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from \ntheir home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and \nthe state where a lawsuit is brought. \n \nSummary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction \n1. \nOnce a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant \nover which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction. \n2. If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3. Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction \nover a particular defendant (see rule 4). \n1. \nIn order to get a judgment in a civil action, the plaintiff must serve a copy of the \ncomplaint and a summons on the defendant. \n2. There are many ways to do this. \n• \nThe process server personally serves a complaint on the defendant. \n• \nThe process server leaves a copy of the summons and complaint at the residence \nof the defendant, in the hands of a competent person. \n• \nThe process server sends the summons and complaint by certified mail, return \nreceipt requested. \n• \nThe process server, if all other means are not possible, notifies the defendant by \npublication in a newspaper having a minimum number of readers (as may be \nspecified by law). \n4. In addition to successfully serving the defendant with process, a plaintiff must convince the court \nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process and any \nstatutes in that state that prescribe the jurisdictional reach of that state (the so-called long-arm \nstatutes). The Supreme Court has long recognized various bases for judging whether such process \nis fair. \n1. \nConsent. The defendant agrees to the court’s jurisdiction by coming to court, answering \nthe complaint, and having the matter litigated there. \n2. Domicile. The defendant is a permanent resident of that state. \n3. Event.

She could file a lawsuit \nanywhere in the country. She could file a lawsuit in Arizona after she establishes residency there. But \nwhile the Arizona court would have subject matter jurisdiction over any products-liability claim (or any \nclaim that was not required to be heard in a federal court), the Arizona court would face an issue of “in \npersonam jurisdiction,” or personal jurisdiction: under the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, each state must extend due process to citizens of all of the other states. Because fairness is \nessential to due process, the court must consider whether it is fair to require an out-of-state defendant to \nappear and defend against a lawsuit that could result in a judgment against that defendant. \nAlmost every state in the United States has a statute regarding personal jurisdiction, instructing judges \nwhen it is permissible to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state resident. These are called long-\narm statutes. But no state can reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally permissible under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights of \nthe citizens of every state in the union. The “minimum contacts” test in Burger King v. \nRudzewicz (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") tries to make the fairness mandate of the due process clause more \nspecific. So do other tests articulated in the case (such as “does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice”). These tests are posed by the Supreme Court and heeded by all lower courts in \norder to honor the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees. These tests are in \naddition to any state long-arm statute’s instructions to courts regarding the assertion of personal \njurisdiction over nonresidents. \n \nChoice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses \nIn a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it will honor contractual choices of parties in a \nlawsuit. Suppose the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the application of the contract’s \nterms. If the parties are from two different states, the judge may have difficulty determining which law to \napply (see Table 3.1 \"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). But if the contract says that a particular state’s \nlaw will be applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply that state’s law as a rule of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n105 \ndecision in the case. For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with \nGoldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this \nagreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a \nMissouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims \nthat Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the \njudge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs. \n \nOrdinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause. In a choice-of-forum \nclause, the parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in the event of a dispute arising under \nthe terms of contract. For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from Alamo at the Denver \nInternational Airport. He does not look at the fine print on the contract. He also waives all collision and \nother insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental. While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass \nFestival, he has an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado. His rented Nissan Altima is badly damaged. On \nreturning to Virginia, he would like to settle up with Alamo, but his insurance company and Alamo cannot \ncome to terms. He realizes, however, that he has agreed to hear the dispute with Alamo in a specific court \nin San Antonio, Texas. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any court in the United States is likely to \nuphold the choice-of-form clause and require Harold (or his insurance company) to litigate in San \nAntonio, Texas. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are two court systems in the United States. It is important to know which system—the state court \nsystem or the federal court system—has the power to hear and decide a particular case. Once that is",

These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks. (2) The defendant can move to \ndismiss the complaint on the grounds that the plaintiff failed to “state a claim on which relief can be \ngranted,” or on the basis that there is no subject matter jurisdiction for the court chosen by the plaintiff, \nor on the basis that there is no personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The defendant is saying, in effect, \nthat even if all the plaintiff’s allegations are true, they do not amount to a legal claim that can be heard by \nthe court. For example, a claim that the defendant induced a woman to stop dating the plaintiff (a so-\ncalled alienation of affections cause of action) is no longer actionable in US state courts, and any court will \ndismiss the complaint without any further proceedings. (This type of dismissal is occasionally still called a \ndemurrer.) \n \nA third kind of dismissal can take place on a motion for summary judgment. If there is no triable \nquestion of fact or law, there is no reason to have a trial. For example, the plaintiff sues on a promissory \nnote and, at deposition (an oral examination under oath), the defendant admits having made no payment \non the note and offers no excuse that would be recognizable as a reason not to pay. There is no reason to \nhave a trial, and the court should grant summary judgment. \n \nDiscovery \nIf there is a factual dispute, the case will usually involve some degree of discovery, where each party tries \nto get as much information out of the other party as the rules allow. Until the 1940s, when discovery \nbecame part of civil procedure rules, a lawsuit was frequently a game in which each party hid as much \ninformation as possible and tried to surprise the other party in court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n109 \nBeginning with a change in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in 1938 \nand subsequently followed by many of the states, the parties are entitled to learn the facts of the case \nbefore trial. The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other. This is a broad right, as it is not limited to just \nevidence that is admissible at trial. Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process. For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a",

They are disposed of by motions to dismiss or are settled after extensive \ndiscovery makes clear to the parties the strengths and weaknesses of the parties to the dispute. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n110 \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Mrs. Robinson (in the Volkswagen Audi case) never establishes residency in Arizona, returns to New York, \nand files her case in federal district court in New York, alleging diversity jurisdiction. Assume that the \ndefendants do not want to have the case heard in federal court. What motion will they make? \n2. Under contributory negligence, the negligence of any plaintiff that causes or contributes to the injuries a \nplaintiff complains of will be grounds for dismissal. Suppose that in discovery, Mr. Ferlito in Ferlito v. \nJohnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") admits that he brought the cigarette lighter dangerously close to \nhis costume, saying, “Yes, you could definitely say I was being careless; I had a few drinks under my belt.” \nAlso, Mrs. Ferlito admits that she never reads product instructions from manufacturers. If the case is \nbrought in a state where contributory negligence is the law, on what basis can Johnson & Johnson have the \ncase dismissed before trial? \n \n \n \n \n3.4 The Pretrial and Trial Phase \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how judges can push parties into pretrial settlement. \n2. Explain the meaning and use of directed verdicts. \n3. Distinguish a directed verdict from a judgment n.o.v. (“notwithstanding the verdict”). \n \n \nAfter considerable discovery, one of the parties may believe that there is no triable issue of law or fact \nfor the court to consider and may file a motion with the court for summary judgment. Unless it is \nvery clear, the judge will deny a summary judgment motion, because that ends the case at the trial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n111 \nlevel; it is a “final order” in the case that tells the plaintiff “no” and leaves no room to bring another \nlawsuit against the defendant for that particular set of facts (res judicata). If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

For \nexample, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n112 \nprospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar \nproblem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney \ncould well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In that case, she could use \na challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion, \ncould either accept the for-cause reason or reject it. \n \nEven if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several \nperemptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow. A trial attorney with many years of \nexperience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide \nto use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel. \n \nAfter the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the \nnature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the \nlawyer will present. The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right \nto do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case. \n \nThe plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. \nThe direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The rules of evidence (that govern the \nkinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format \ntend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow. \n \nAnyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will \nappreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may \nor may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is \nasked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge. \n \nAfter direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This \nis a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment \n(the right to confront one’s accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n113 \nand the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem \nimmediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial.",

The plaintiff is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to deny or argue with the \nevidence the defendant has introduced. The defendant in turn may present “surrebuttal” witnesses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n114 \n \nWhen all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask the judge for a directed verdict—a \nverdict decided by the judge without advice from the jury. This motion may be granted if the plaintiff has \nfailed to introduce evidence that is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the defendant has \nfailed to do the same on issues on which she has the burden of proof. (For example, the plaintiff alleges \nthat the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed promissory note. The defendant cannot show \nthat the note is invalid. The defendant must lose the case unless he can show that the debt has been paid \nor otherwise discharged.) \n \nThe defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s case, but the judge will usually \nwait to hear the entire case until deciding whether to do so. Directed verdicts are not usually granted, \nsince it is the jury’s job to determine the facts in dispute. \n \nIf the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer will then present a closing argument to the \njury (or, if there is no jury, to the judge alone). The closing argument is used to tie up the loose ends, as \nthe attorney tries to bring together various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make sense to \nthe jury. \n \nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury. The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to \nthe jurors the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are considering and to tell the jurors what \nfacts they must determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other. Each lawyer will have \nprepared a set of written instructions that she hopes the judge will give to the jury. These will be tailored \nto advance her client’s case. Many a verdict has been overturned on appeal because a trial judge has \nwrongly instructed the jury. The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict. Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is. If it is favorable to the \nparty the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can \ngrant the motion for judgment n.o.v.

There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge. In \ncompiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes \nmade by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper \nevidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must \ndetermine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error. \n \nAppellate and trial procedures are different. The appellate court does not hear witnesses or accept \nevidence. It reviews the record of the case—the transcript of the witnesses’ testimony and the documents \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n118 \nreceived into evidence at trial—to try to find a legal error on a specific request of one or both of the \nparties. The parties’ lawyers prepare briefs (written statements containing the facts in the case), the \nprocedural steps taken, and the argument or discussion of the meaning of the law and how it applies to \nthe facts. After reading the briefs on appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without \nargument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short or many pages. Often, though, the appellate \ncourt will hear oral argument. (This can be months, or even more than a year after the briefs are filed.) \nEach lawyer is given a short period of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his client’s \ncase. The lawyer rarely gets a chance for an extended statement because he is usually interrupted by \nquestions from the judges. Through this exchange between judges and lawyers, specific legal positions can \nbe tested and their limits explored. \n \nDepending on what it decides, the appellate court will affirm the lower court’s \njudgment, modify it, reverse it, or remand it to the lower court for retrial or other action directed by the \nhigher court. The appellate court itself does not take specific action in the case; it sits only to rule on \ncontested issues of law. The lower court must issue the final judgment in the case. As we have already \nseen, there is the possibility of appealing from an intermediate appellate court to the state supreme court \nin twenty-nine states and to the US Supreme Court from a ruling from a federal circuit court of appeal. In \ncases raising constitutional issues, there is also the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court from the \nstate courts. \n \nLike trial judges, appellate judges must follow previous decisions, or precedent. But not every previous \ncase is a precedent for every court. Lower courts must respect appellate court decisions, and courts in one \nstate are not bound by decisions of courts in other states. State courts are not bound by decisions of \nfederal courts, except on points of federal law that come from federal courts within the state or from a \nfederal circuit in which the state court sits. A state supreme court is not bound by case law in any other \nstate. But a supreme court in one state with a type of case it has not previously dealt with may find \npersuasive reasoning in decisions of other state supreme courts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n119 \nFederal district courts are bound by the decisions of the court of appeals in their circuit, but decisions by \none circuit court are not precedents for courts in other circuits.

Strictly speaking, only the exact holding is \nbinding on the lower courts. A holding is the theory of the law that applies to the particular circumstances \npresented in a case. The courts may sometimes declare what they believe to be the law with regard to \npoints that are not central to the case being decided.

Understand the various ways that lawyers charge for services. \n2. Describe the contingent fee system in the United States. \n3. Know the difference between the American rule and the British rule with regard to who pays attorneys’ \nfees. \n \n \nLegal Fees \nLawyers charge for their services in one of three different ways: flat rate, hourly rate, and contingent fee. \nA flat rate is used usually when the work is relatively routine and the lawyer knows in advance \napproximately how long it will take her to do the job. Drawing a will or doing a real estate closing are \nexamples of legal work that is often paid a flat rate. The rate itself may be based on a percentage of the \nworth of the matter—say, 1 percent of a home’s selling price. \n \nLawyers generally charge by the hour for courtroom time and for ongoing representation in commercial \nmatters. Virtually every sizable law firm bills its clients by hourly rates, which in large cities can range \nfrom $300 for an associate’s time to $500 and more for a senior partner’s time. \n \nA contingent fee is one that is paid only if the lawyer wins—that is, it is contingent, or depends upon, the \nsuccess of the case. This type of fee arrangement is used most often in personal injury cases (e.g., \nautomobile accidents, products liability, and professional malpractice). Although used quite often, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n125 \ncontingent fee is controversial. Trial lawyers justify it by pointing to the high cost of preparing for such \nlawsuits. A typical automobile accident case can cost at least ten thousand dollars to prepare, and a \ncomplicated products-liability case can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Few people have that kind of \nmoney or would be willing to spend it on the chance that they might win a lawsuit. Corporate and \nprofessional defendants complain that the contingent fee gives lawyers a license to go big game hunting, \nor to file suits against those with deep pockets in the hopes of forcing them to settle. \n \nTrial lawyers respond that the contingent fee arrangement forces them to screen cases and weed out cases \nthat are weak, because it is not worth their time to spend the hundreds of hours necessary on such cases if \ntheir chances of winning are slim or nonexistent. \n \nCosts \nIn England and in many other countries, the losing party must pay the legal expenses of the winning \nparty, including attorneys’ fees. That is not the general rule in this country. Here, each party must pay \nmost of its own costs, including (and especially) the fees of lawyers. (Certain relatively minor costs, such \nas filing fees for various documents required in court, are chargeable to the losing side, if the judge \ndecides it.) This type of fee structure is known as the American rule (in contrast to the British rule). \n \nThere are two types of exceptions to the American rule. By statute, Congress and the state legislatures \nhave provided that the winning party in particular classes of cases may recover its full legal costs from the \nloser—for example, the federal antitrust laws so provide and so does the federal Equal Access to Justice \nAct. The other exception applies to litigants who either initiate lawsuits in bad faith, with no expectation \nof winning, or who defend them in bad faith, in order to cause the plaintiff great expense. Under these \ncircumstances, a court has the discretion to award attorneys’ fees to the winner.

Getting a lawyer can be costly, unless you get a lawyer on a contingent fee. Not all legal \nsystems allow contingent fees. In many legal systems, the loser pays attorneys’ fees for both parties. \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Mrs. Robinson’s attorney estimates that they will recover a million dollars from Volkswagen in the Audi \nlawsuit. She has Mrs. Robinson sign a contract that gives her firm one-third of any recovery after the firm’s \nexpenses are deducted. The judge does in fact award a million dollars, and the defendant pays. The firm’s \nexpenses are $100,000. How much does Mrs. Robinson get? \n2. Harry Potter brings a lawsuit against Draco Malfoy in Chestershire, England, for slander, a form of \ndefamation. Potter alleges that Malfoy insists on calling him a mudblood. Ron Weasley testifies, as does \nNeville Chamberlain. But Harry loses, because the court has no conception of wizardry and cannot make \nsense of the case at all. In dismissing the case, however, who (under English law) will bear the costs of the \nattorneys who have brought the case for Potter and defended the matter for Malfoy? \n \n \n \n \n3.8 Alternative Means of Resolving Disputes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how arbitration and mediation are frequently used alternatives to litigation. \n2. Describe the differences between arbitration and mediation. \n3. Explain why arbitration is final and binding. \n \n \nDisputes do not have to be settled in court. No law requires parties who have a legal dispute to seek \njudicial resolution if they can resolve their disagreement privately or through some other public \nforum. In fact, the threat of a lawsuit can frequently motivate parties toward private negotiation. \nFiling a lawsuit may convince one party that the other party is serious. Or the parties may decide that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n127 \nthey will come to terms privately rather than wait the three or four years it can frequently take for a \ncase to move up on the court calendar. \n \nArbitration \nBeginning around 1980, a movement toward alternative dispute resolution began to gain force throughout \nthe United States. Bar associations, other private groups, and the courts themselves wanted to find \nquicker and cheaper ways for litigants and potential litigants to settle certain types of quarrels than \nthrough the courts. As a result, neighborhood justice centers or dispute resolution centers have sprung up \nin communities. These are where people can come for help in settling disputes, of both civil and criminal \nnature, that should not consume the time and money of the parties or courts in lengthy proceedings. \n \nThese alternative forums use a variety of methods, including arbitration, mediation, and conciliation, to \nbring about agreement or at least closure of the dispute. These methods are not all alike, and their \ndifferences are worth noting. \n \nArbitration is a type of adjudication. The parties use a private decision maker, the arbitrator, and the \nrules of procedure are considerably more relaxed than those that apply in the courtroom. Arbitrators \nmight be retired judges, lawyers, or anyone with the kind of specialized knowledge and training that \nwould be useful in making a final, binding decision on the dispute. In a contractual relationship, the \nparties can decide even before a dispute arises to use arbitration when the time comes. Or parties can \ndecide after a dispute arises to use arbitration instead of litigation. In a predispute arbitration agreement \n(often part of a larger contract), the parties can spell out the rules of procedure to be used and the method \nfor choosing the arbitrator. For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities. The association uses \npublished sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration);",

Rudzewicz \nBurger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz \n471 U.S. 462 (U.S. Supreme Court 1985) \n \nSummary \nBurger King Corp. is a Florida corporation with principal offices in Miami. It principally conducts \nrestaurant business through franchisees. The franchisees are licensed to use Burger King’s trademarks \nand service marks in standardized restaurant facilities. Rudzewicz is a Michigan resident who, with a \npartner (MacShara) operated a Burger King franchise in Drayton Plains, Michigan. Negotiations for \nsetting up the franchise occurred in 1978 largely between Rudzewicz, his partner, and a regional office of \nBurger King in Birmingham, Michigan, although some deals and concessions were made by Burger King \nin Florida. A preliminary agreement was signed in February of 1979. Rudzewicz and MacShara assumed \noperation of an existing facility in Drayton Plains and MacShara attended prescribed management \ncourses in Miami during the four months following Feb. 1979. \n \nRudzewicz and MacShara bought $165,000 worth of restaurant equipment from Burger King’s Davmor \nIndustries division in Miami. But before the final agreements were signed, the parties began to disagree \nover site-development fees, building design, computation of monthly rent, and whether Rudzewicz and \nMacShara could assign their liabilities to a corporation they had formed. Negotiations took place between \nRudzewicz, MacShara, and the Birmingham regional office; but Rudzewicz and MacShara learned that the \nregional office had limited decision-making power and turned directly to Miami headquarters for their \nconcerns. The final agreement was signed by June 1979 and provided that the franchise relationship was \ngoverned by Florida law, and called for payment of all required fees and forwarding of all relevant notices \nto Miami headquarters. \n \nThe Drayton Plains restaurant did fairly well at first, but a recession in late 1979 caused the franchisees to \nfall far behind in their monthly payments to Miami. Notice of default was sent from Miami to Rudzewicz, \nwho nevertheless continued to operate the restaurant as a Burger King franchise. Burger King sued in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n131 \nfederal district court for the southern district of Florida. Rudzewicz contested the court’s personal \njurisdiction over him, since he had never been to Florida. \n \nThe federal court looked to Florida’s long arm statute and held that it did have personal jurisdiction over \nthe non-resident franchisees, and awarded Burger King a quarter of a million dollars in contract damages \nand enjoined the franchisees from further operation of the Drayton Plains facility. Franchisees appealed \nto the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and won a reversal based on lack of personal jurisdiction. Burger King \npetitioned the Supreme Ct. for a writ of certiorari. \n \nJustice Brennan delivered the opinion of the court. \n \nThe Due Process Clause protects an individual’s liberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established no meaningful “contacts, ties, or relations.” \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington. By requiring that individuals have “fair warning that a particular \nactivity may subject [them] to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign,” the Due Process Clause “gives a \ndegree of predictability to the legal system that allows potential defendants to structure their primary \nconduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to \nsuit.”… \n \nWhere a forum seeks to assert specific jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has not consented \nto suit there, this “fair warning” requirement is satisfied if the defendant has “purposefully directed” his \nactivities at residents of the forum, and the litigation results from alleged injuries that “arise out of or \nrelate to” those activities, Thus “[t]he forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process \nClause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of \ncommerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State” and those \nproducts subsequently injure forum consumers. Similarly, a publisher who distributes magazines in a \ndistant State may fairly be held accountable in that forum for damages resulting there from an allegedly \ndefamatory story.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

The application of that rule will vary \nwith the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be \nsome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities \nwithin the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. \n \nThis “purposeful availment” requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction \nsolely as a result of “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated” contacts, or of the “unilateral activity of \nanother party or a third person,” [Citations] Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts \nproximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a “substantial connection” with the \nforum State. [Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities \nwithin a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he \nmanifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are \nshielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to \nrequire him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. \n \nJurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically \nenter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320. Thus courts in “appropriate case[s]” may evaluate “the burden on the \ndefendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient \nresolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of \njurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required.

[1] [Citations omitted] In the absence of evidence that a warning \nwould have prevented the harm complained of by altering the plaintiff’s conduct, the failure to warn \ncannot be deemed a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury as a matter of law.

App. 79, 225 N.W.2d 175 (1974). \n \nIn the instant action no reasonable jury could find that JJP’s failure to warn of the flammability of cotton \nbatting was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries because plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n137 \nestablish that a flammability warning on JJP’s cotton batting would have dissuaded them from using the \nproduct in the manner that they did. \n \nPlaintiffs repeatedly stated in their response brief that plaintiff Susan Ferlito testified that “she would \nnever again use cotton batting to make a costume…However, a review of the trial transcript reveals that \nplaintiff Susan Ferlito never testified that she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume. \nMore importantly, the transcript contains no statement by plaintiff Susan Ferlito that a flammability \nwarning on defendant JJP’s product would have dissuaded her from using the cotton batting to construct \nthe costume in the first place. At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no \ntestimony during the trial that either plaintiff Susan Ferlito or her husband, plaintiff Frank J. Ferlito, \nwould have acted any different if there had been a flammability warning on the product’s package. The \nabsence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs’ case; for without it, plaintiffs have failed to prove \nproximate cause, one of the essential elements of their negligence claim. \nIn addition, both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame. \nSusan Ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if",

Describe how the Supreme Court, under the supremacy clause of the Constitution, balances state and \nfederal laws that may be wholly or partly in conflict. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n140 \n7. Explain how the Bill of Rights relates to business activities in the United States. \n \n \nThe US Constitution is the foundation for all of US law. Business and commerce are directly affected \nby the words, meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution. Because it speaks in general terms, \nits provisions raise all kinds of issues for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators. \nFor example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning of “federalism,” the concept that \nthere is shared governance between the states and the federal government. The US Supreme Court is \nthe ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has \nassumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can \nstrike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the \npresident’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language. No knowledgeable \ncitizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions. \n \n \n4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution. \n2. Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers. \n3. Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant. \n \n \nThe Constitution as Reflecting American Values \nIn the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving \nallegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution \n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this \noath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n141 \ntime—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; \nthe fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes \nclear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the \nidea of rights is particularly strong. \n \nThe Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various \nrights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights.

Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so \nthe federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. \nThe Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect \nof this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important \nlegislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently \nrequires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. \n \nBecause the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and \n“equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases. The \nUnited States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for \nitself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means. The famous case of Marbury v. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n143 \nMadison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new \nrepublic. The decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to \nshape our destiny as a nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court \nregarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court’s ruling was \npurportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nFrom Marbury to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution \nsets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created. Thus any statute (or \nportion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not \nenforceable. And as the Bush v. Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they \nmight choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign. \n \nIf the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily \noverturned. Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and \nthree-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V). \n \nBecause the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how \nit should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have. President \nRichard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not \nadd to its language. Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as",

Federal Election Commission case (Section 4.6.5), which held \nthat corporations are “persons” with “free speech rights” that include spending unlimited amounts of \nmoney in campaign donations and political advocacy. [3] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n144 \nBecause Roe v. Wade has been so controversial, this chapter includes a seminal case on “the right of \nprivacy,” Griswold v. Connecticut, Section 4.6.1. Was the court was correct in recognizing a “right of \nprivacy” in Griswold? This may not seem like a “business case,” but consider: the manufacture and \ndistribution of birth control devices is a highly profitable (and legal) business in every US state. Moreover, \nGriswold illustrates another important and much-debated concept in US constitutional law: substantive \ndue process (see Section 4.5.3 \"Fifth Amendment\"). The problem of judicial review and its proper scope is \nbrought into sharp focus in the abortion controversy. Abortion became a lucrative service business \nafter Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. That has gradually changed, with state laws that have limited \nrather than overruled Roe v. Wade and with persistent antiabortion protests, killings of abortion doctors, \nand efforts to publicize the human nature of the fetuses being aborted. The key here is to understand that \nthere is no explicit mention in the Constitution of any right of privacy. As Justice Harry Blackmun argued \nin his majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, \n \nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, \nthe Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy or a guarantee of certain areas or zones \nof privacy, does exist under the Constitution.…[T]hey also make it clear that the right has some \nextension to activities relating to marriage…procreation…contraception…family \nrelationships…and child rearing and education.…The right of privacy…is broad enough to \nencompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. \n \nIn short, justices interpreting the Constitution wield quiet yet enormous power through judicial review. In \ndeciding that the right of privacy applied to a woman’s decision to abort in the first trimester, the \nSupreme Court did not act on the basis of a popular mandate or clear and unequivocal language in the \nConstitution, and it made illegal any state or federal legislative or executive action contrary to its \ninterpretation. Only a constitutional amendment or the court’s repudiation of Roe v. Wade as a precedent \ncould change that interpretation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n145 \nThe Constitution gives voice to the idea that people have basic rights and that a civilian president is also the \ncommander in chief of the armed forces. It gives instructions as to how the various branches of government \nmust share power and also tries to balance power between the states and the federal government. It does not \nexpressly allow for judicial review, but the Supreme Court’s ability to declare what laws are (or are not) \nconstitutional has given the judicial branch a kind of power not seen in other industrialized democracies. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Suppose the Supreme Court declares that Congress and the president cannot authorize the indefinite \ndetention of terrorist suspects without a trial of some sort, whether military or civilian. Suppose also that \nthe people of the United States favor such indefinite detention and that Congress wants to pass a law \nrebuking the court’s decision. What kind of law would have to be passed, by what institutions, and by what \nvoting percentages? \n2. When does a prior decision of the Supreme Court deserve overturning? Name one decision of the Supreme \nCourt that you think is no longer “good law.” Does the court have to wait one hundred years to overturn its \nprior case precedents? \n \n  \n \n[1] In Scott v. Sanford (the Dred Scott decision), the court states that Scott should remain a slave, that as a slave he \nis not a citizen of the United States and thus not eligible to bring suit in a federal court, and that as a slave he is \npersonal property and thus has never been free.",

Name the specific clause through which Congress has the power to regulate commerce. What, specifically, \ndoes this clause say? \n2. Explain how early decisions of the Supreme Court interpreted the scope of the commerce clause and how \nthat impacted the legislative proposals and programs of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great \nDepression. \n3. Describe both the wider use of the commerce clause from World War II through the 1990s and the \nlimitations the Supreme Court imposed in Lopez and other cases. \n \n \nFirst, turn to Article I, Section 8. The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make \nlaws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states. Most of the \nfederally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the \nConstitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of \nCongress unconstitutional. \n \nHere are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. \nThe commerce clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to \nprevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. \n \nThe Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to \ncontrol interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen. The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of",

But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was",

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was \nchallenged on the ground that Congress lacked the power under the commerce clause to regulate what \nwas otherwise fairly local conduct. For example, Title II of the act prohibited racial discrimination in \npublic accommodations (such as hotels, motels, and restaurants), leading to the famous case \nof Katzenbach v. McClung(1964). \n \nOllie McClung’s barbeque place in Birmingham, Alabama, allowed “colored” people to buy takeout at the \nback of the restaurant but not to sit down with “white” folks inside. The US attorney sought a court order \nto require Ollie to serve all races and colors, but Ollie resisted on commerce clause grounds: the federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n150 \ngovernment had no business regulating a purely local establishment. Indeed, Ollie did not advertise \nnationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from the local area. But the court found that some \n42 percent of the supplies for Ollie’s restaurant had moved in the channels of interstate commerce. This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against Morrison and Crawford \nunder Virginia Tech’s sexual assault policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault \nand sentenced to immediate suspension for two semesters. Crawford was not punished. A second hearing \nagain found Morrison guilty. After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n151 \npunishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the \nuniversity. Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA. Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as \ndid the Supreme Court.",

Why would Congress have power under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require restaurants and hotels to not \ndiscriminate against interstate travelers on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, or national origin? Suppose \nthe Holiday Restaurant near I-80 in Des Moines, Iowa, has a sign that says, “We reserve the right to refuse \nservice to any Muslim or person of Middle Eastern descent.” Suppose also that the restaurant is very \npopular locally and that only 40 percent of its patrons are travelers on I-80. Are the owners of the Holiday \nRestaurant in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? What would happen if the owners resisted \nenforcement by claiming that Title II of the act (relating to “public accommodations” such as hotels, motels, \nand restaurants) was unconstitutional? \n2. If the Supreme Court were to go back to the days of Hammer v. Dagenhart and rule that only goods and \nservices involving interstate movement could be subject to federal law, what kinds of federal programs \nmight be lacking a sound basis in the commerce clause? “Obamacare”? Medicare? Homeland security? \nSocial Security? What other powers are granted to Congress under the Constitution to legislate for the \ngeneral good of society? \n \n  \n \n[1] Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, 220 US 45 (1911). \n[2] Hoke v. United States, 227 US 308 (1913). \n[3] Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 US 294 (1964). \n \n \n \n4.3 Dormant Commerce Clause \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand that when Congress does not exercise its powers under the commerce clause, the Supreme \nCourt may still limit state legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or places an undue \nburden on interstate commerce. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n154 \n2. Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways. [1] Iowa’s prohibition was judicially declared void when the Supreme Court judged it to be an \nundue burden. \n \nDiscrimination cases such as Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\") \npose a different standard. The court has been fairly inflexible here: if one state discriminates in its \ntreatment of any article of commerce based on its state of origin, the court will strike down the law. For \nexample, in Oregon Waste Systems v. Department of Environmental Quality, the state wanted to place a \nslightly higher charge on waste coming from out of state. [2] The state’s reasoning was that in-state \nresidents had already contributed to roads and other infrastructure and that tipping fees at waste facilities \nshould reflect the prior contributions of in-state companies and residents. Out-of-state waste handlers \nwho wanted to use Oregon landfills objected and won their dormant commerce clause claim that Oregon’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n155 \nlaw discriminated “on its face” against interstate commerce. Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere.

(Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has declined to do so. What follows is a \nstatement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant \namounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada. \n \nDealing with Unwelcome Waste \nSenator Carl Levin, January 2003 \nMichigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other \nstates and Canada. \n \nCanada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan. Approximately 65 truckloads of waste \ncome in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from \nCanada each day. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n156 \nThis problem isn’t going to get any better. Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto \narea signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills. At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two \ncountries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement. To protect both countries, the \nagreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that \nthe importing country may withdraw consent for shipments. Both reasons are evidence that these \nshipments were intended to be limited. However, the agreement’s provisions have not been \nenforced by the United States. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n157 \nCanada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not \nimplemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan. Although those of \nus that introduced this legislation believe that the Environmental Protection Agency has the \nauthority to enforce this agreement, they have not done so. Our bill would require the EPA \n[Environmental Protection Agency] to enforce the agreement. \n \nIn order to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Michigan and our environment, we \nmust consider the impact of the importation of trash on state and local recycling efforts, landfill",

Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express \npreemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s. The case was a wrongful death action \nbrought against tobacco companies on behalf of Rose Cipollone, a lung cancer victim who had started \nsmoking cigarette in the 1940s. The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that \nstated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to \nthe advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions \nwere preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of \nthe supremacy clause. Preemption can be express or implied. In cases where preemption is implied, the court \nusually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory \nscheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The legislation does preserve the right of \nconsumers to litigate in the event of a dispute arising with the product or service provider; that is, with this \nlegislation, consumers will not unknowingly waive their right to a trial at common law.

The \ncourt refers to this process as selective incorporation. \n \nHere are some very basic principles to remember: \n \n1. The guarantees of the Bill of Rights apply only to state and federal government action. They do not limit \nwhat a company or person in the private sector may do. For example, states may not impose censorship \non the media or limit free speech in a way that offends the First Amendment, but your boss (in the \nprivate sector) may order you not to talk to the media. \n2. In some cases, a private company may be regarded as participating in “state action.” For example, a \nprivate defense contractor that gets 90 percent of its business from the federal government has been \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n164 \nheld to be public for purposes of enforcing the constitutional right to free speech (the company had a \nrule barring its employees from speaking out in public against its corporate position). It has even been \nargued that public regulation of private activity is sufficient to convert the private into public activity, \nthus subjecting it to the requirements of due process. But the Supreme Court rejected this extreme view \nin 1974 when it refused to require private power companies, regulated by the state, to give customers a \nhearing before cutting off electricity for failure to pay the bill. [1] \n3. States have rights, too. While “states rights” was a battle cry of Southern states before the Civil War, the \nquestion of what balance to strike between state sovereignty and federal union has never been simple. \nIn Kimel v. Florida, for example, the Supreme Court found in the words of the Eleventh Amendment a \nbasis for declaring that states may not have to obey certain federal statutes. \n \nFirst Amendment \nIn part, the First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, \nor of the press.” The Founding Fathers believed that democracy would work best if people (and the press) \ncould talk or write freely, without governmental interference. But the First Amendment was also not \nintended to be as absolute as it sounded. Oliver Wendell Holmes’s famous dictum that the law does not \npermit you to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theater has seldom been answered, “But why not?” And no one in \n1789 thought that defamation laws (torts for slander and libel) had been made unconstitutional. \nMoreover, because the apparent purpose of the First Amendment was to make sure that the nation had a \ncontinuing, vigorous debate over matters political, political speech has been given the highest level of \nprotection over such other forms of speech as (1) “commercial speech,” (2) speech that can and should be \nlimited by reasonable “time, place, and manner” restrictions, or (3) obscene speech. \n \nBecause of its higher level of protection, political speech can be false, malicious, mean-spirited, or even a \npack of lies. A public official in the United States must be prepared to withstand all kinds of false \naccusations and cannot succeed in an action for defamation unless the defendant has acted with “malice” \nand “reckless disregard” of the truth. Public figures, such as CEOs of the largest US banks, must also be \nprepared to withstand accusations that are false. In any defamation action, truth is a defense, but a \ndefamation action brought by a public figure or public official must prove that the defendant not only has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n165 \nhis facts wrong but also lies to the public in a malicious way with reckless disregard of the truth. \nCelebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Jon Stewart have the same burden to go forward with a defamation \naction. It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political",

But the First Amendment was also not intended to be as absolute as it sounded. Oliver Wendell Holmes’s famous dictum that the law does not permit you to shout “Fire!” in a crowded theater has seldom been answered, “But why not?” And no one in 1789 thought that defamation laws (torts for slander and libel) had been made unconstitutional. Moreover, because the apparent purpose of the First Amendment was to make sure that the nation had a continuing, vigorous debate over matters political, political speech has been given the highest level of protection over such other forms of speech as (1) “commercial speech,” (2) speech that can and should be limited by reasonable “time, place, and manner” restrictions, or (3) obscene speech. Because of its higher level of protection, political speech can be false, malicious, mean-spirited, or even a pack of lies. A public official in the United States must be prepared to withstand all kinds of false accusations and cannot succeed in an action for defamation unless the defendant has acted with “malice” and “reckless disregard” of the truth. Public figures, such as CEOs of the largest US banks, must also be prepared to withstand accusations that are false. In any defamation action, truth is a defense, but a defamation action brought by a public figure or public official must prove that the defendant not only has his facts wrong but also lies to the public in a malicious way with reckless disregard of the truth. Celebrities such as Lindsay Lohan and Jon Stewart have the same burden to go forward with a defamation action. It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public officials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the protection of the First Amendment."

Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all \nemployees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object \nbased on the Fourth Amendment.

In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.

Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties. The first category \nincludes most of the liberties expressly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. Through a process known as \nselective incorporation, the court has interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \nbar states from denying their residents the most important freedoms guaranteed in the first ten \namendments to the federal Constitution. Only the Third Amendment right (against involuntary \nquartering of soldiers) and the Fifth Amendment right to be indicted by a grand jury have not been made \napplicable to the states. Because these rights are still not applicable to state governments, the Supreme \nCourt is often said to have “selectively incorporated” the Bill of Rights into the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n169 \nThe second category of fundamental liberties includes those liberties that are not expressly stated in the \nBill of Rights but that can be seen as essential to the concepts of freedom and equality in a democratic \nsociety. These unstated liberties come from Supreme Court precedents, common law, moral philosophy, \nand deeply rooted traditions of US legal history. The Supreme Court has stressed that he \nword liberty cannot be defined by a definitive list of rights; rather, it must be viewed as a rational \ncontinuum of freedom through which every aspect of human behavior is protected from arbitrary \nimpositions and random restraints. In this regard, as the Supreme Court has observed, the due process \nclause protects abstract liberty interests, including the right to personal autonomy, bodily integrity, self-\ndignity, and self-determination. \n \nThese liberty interests often are grouped to form a general right to privacy, which was first recognized \nin Griswold v. Connecticut (Section 4.6.1), where the Supreme Court struck down a state statute \nforbidding married adults from using, possessing, or distributing contraceptives on the ground that the \nlaw violated the sanctity of the marital relationship. According to Justice Douglas’s plurality opinion, this \npenumbra of privacy, though not expressly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, must be protected to establish \na buffer zone or breathing space for those freedoms that are constitutionally enumerated. \n \nBut substantive due process has seen fairly limited use since the 1930s. During the 1990s, the Supreme \nCourt was asked to recognize a general right to die under the doctrine of substantive due process. \nAlthough the court stopped short of establishing such a far-reaching right, certain patients may exercise a \nconstitutional liberty to hasten their deaths under a narrow set of circumstances. In Cruzan v. Missouri \nDepartment of Health, the Supreme Court ruled that the due process clause guarantees the right of \ncompetent adults to make advanced directives for the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures should they \nbecome incapacitated by a disability that leaves them in a persistent vegetative state. [4] Once it has been \nestablished by clear and convincing evidence that a mentally incompetent and persistently vegetative \npatient made such a prior directive, a spouse, parent, or other appropriate guardian may seek to terminate \nany form of artificial hydration or nutrition. \n \nFourteenth Amendment: Due Process and Equal Protection Guarantees \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n170 \nThe Fourteenth Amendment (1868) requires that states treat citizens of other states with due process. \nThis can be either an issue of procedural due process (as in Section 3.9 \"Cases\", Burger King v. \nRudzewicz) or an issue of substantive due process. For substantive due process, consider what happened \nin an Alabama court not too long ago. [5] \nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered \nthat the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been \nrepainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best estimates, \nworth about 10 percent less than he paid for it. The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car.

In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The \nAlabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the \ndefendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury \nawarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which \nwas later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the \ncourt found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate \nsubstantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably \nnecessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. \n \n“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. \nThe amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause. It means that, generally speaking, \ngovernments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen. For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking \nthat would attract even more tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld. The law would be upheld only if it were necessary to promote a compelling state interest. \nVery few laws that have a racial or ethnic classification meet that test. \n \nThe strict scrutiny test will be applied to classifications involving racial and ethnic criteria as well as",

Connecticut \n381 U.S. 479 (U.S. Supreme Court 1965) \n \nA nineteenth-century Connecticut law made the use, possession, or distribution of birth control devices \nillegal. The law also prohibited anyone from giving information about such devices. The executive \ndirector and medical director of a planned parenthood association were found guilty of giving out such \ninformation to a married couple that wished to delay having children for a few years. The directors \nwere fined $100 each. \n \nThey appealed throughout the Connecticut state court system, arguing that the state law violated \n(infringed) a basic or fundamental right of privacy of a married couple: to live together and have sex \ntogether without the restraining power of the state to tell them they may legally have intercourse but \nnot if they use condoms or other birth control devices. At each level (trial court, court of appeals, and \nConnecticut Supreme Court), the Connecticut courts upheld the constitutionality of the convictions. \n \nPlurality Opinion by Justice William O. Douglass \n \nWe do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch \neconomic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. The [Connecticut] law, however, operates \ndirectly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation. \n \n[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by \nemanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create \nzones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The \nThird Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace \nwithout the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.  \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n175 \nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-\nIncrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force \nhim to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the \nConstitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” \n \nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of \nthe sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the \nFourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and \nparticularly reserved to the people.” \n \n[The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their \nmanufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] \nrelationship. Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of \nmarital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of \nprivacy surrounding the marital relationship. \n \nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than \nour school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate \nto the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in \nliving, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for \nas noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. \n \nMr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting. \n \nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I \nthink this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in \nthe oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the \nrelationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n176 \nethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of \nbirth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made. But we \nare not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold \nthat it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n…",

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce. [T]he Secretary of \nAgriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop \nof wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into \nallotments for individual farms. \nIt is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I, § 8, clause 3, Congress does not \npossess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise. The question would merit little consideration \nsince our decision in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, sustaining the federal power to regulate \nproduction of goods for commerce, except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to \nproduction not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm. \n \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \n450 U.S. 662 (U.S. Supreme Court 1981) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n179 \n \nJUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE \nWHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS joined. \n \nThe question is whether an Iowa statute that prohibits the use of certain large trucks within the State \nunconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \n \nI \nAppellee Consolidated Freightways Corporation of Delaware (Consolidated) is one of the largest common \ncarriers in the country: it offers service in 48 States under a certificate of public convenience and necessity \nissued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180 \nBecause of Iowa’s statutory scheme, Consolidated cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move commodities \nthrough the State. Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce",

On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests. \nThe total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and \nproblematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from \ninterferences that seriously impede it.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n181 \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 612 F.2d 1064 (1979). It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980). We now affirm. \n \n \n \nII \nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication. The \nClause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the \nstate[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949). The Clause permits \nCongress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent \nactions of the States. It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power \neven without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333 at 350 (1977). The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local",

Washington Apple Advertising Commission \nHunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission \n432 U.S. 33 (U.S. Supreme Court 1977) \n \nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nIn 1973, North Carolina enacted a statute which required, inter alia, all closed containers of apples sold, \noffered for sale, or shipped into the State to bear “no grade other than the applicable U.S. grade or \nstandard.”…Washington State is the Nation’s largest producer of apples, its crops accounting for \napproximately 30% of all apples grown domestically and nearly half of all apples shipped in closed \ncontainers in interstate commerce. [Because] of the importance of the apple industry to the State, its \nlegislature has undertaken to protect and enhance the reputation of Washington apples by establishing a \nstringent, mandatory inspection program [that] requires all apples shipped in interstate commerce to be \ntested under strict quality standards and graded accordingly. In all cases, the Washington State grades \n[are] the equivalent of, or superior to, the comparable grades and standards adopted by the [U.S. Dept. of] \nAgriculture (USDA). \n \n[In] 1972, the North Carolina Board of Agriculture adopted an administrative regulation, unique in the 50 \nStates, which in effect required all closed containers of apples shipped into or sold in the State to display \neither the applicable USDA grade or a notice indicating no classification. State grades were expressly \nprohibited. In addition to its obvious consequence—prohibiting the display of Washington State apple \ngrades on containers of apples shipped into North Carolina—the regulation presented the Washington \napple industry with a marketing problem of potentially nationwide significance. Washington apple \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n187 \ngrowers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 \nof which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State \nvariety and grade. [Compliance] with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required \nWashington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving \ntheir product a damaged appearance. Alternatively, they could have changed their marketing practices to \naccommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina \nin containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for \nthat market in such special containers. As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted \ncontainers entirely. None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry. \nMoreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to \ndisplay the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive \ninspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd \nyears of its existence.… \n \nUnsuccessful in its attempts to secure administrative relief [with North Carolina], the Commission \ninstituted this action challenging the constitutionality of the statute. [The] District Court found that the \nNorth Carolina statute, while neutral on its face, actually discriminated against Washington State growers \nand dealers in favor of their local counterparts [and] concluded that this discrimination [was] not justified \nby the asserted local interest—the elimination of deception and confusion from the marketplace—arguably \nfurthered by the [statute]. \n \n… \n \n[North Carolina] maintains that [the] burdens on the interstate sale of Washington apples were far \noutweighed by the local benefits flowing from what they contend was a valid exercise of North Carolina’s \n[police powers]. Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This",

Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,",

This makes Austin’s antidistortion rationale all the \nmore an aberration. “[T]he First Amendment protects the right of corporations to petition legislative and \nadministrative bodies.” Bellotti, 435 U.S., at 792, n. 31.… \n \nEven if §441b’s expenditure ban were constitutional, wealthy corporations could still lobby elected \nofficials, although smaller corporations may not have the resources to do so. And wealthy individuals and \nunincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. See, e.g., WRTL, \n551 U.S., at 503–504 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (“In the 2004 election cycle, a mere 24 individuals contributed \nan astounding total of $142 million to [26 U.S.C. §527 organizations]”). Yet certain disfavored \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n196 \nassociations of citizens—those that have taken on the corporate form—are penalized for engaging in the \nsame political speech. \n \nWhen Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person \nmay get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to \ncontrol thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves. \n \nWhat we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most \npart relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate \npolitical speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… \n \nWhen Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may \nnot choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from \nindependent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before \nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to \ndispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, \nmust comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is \nthe governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is \nnot a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to \npreventing quid pro quo corruption. \n \nOur precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it \nputs us on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to \nadhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at \nstake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.” [citing prior cases] \n \nThese considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier \nprecedents in Buckley and Bellotti. “This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the \nFirst Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U.S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n197 \nand not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106 at \n119 (1940). \n \nAustin is undermined by experience since its announcement. Political speech is so ingrained in our \nculture that speakers find ways to circumvent campaign finance laws. See, e.g., McConnell, 540 U.S., at \n176–177 (“Given BCRA’s tighter restrictions on the raising and spending of soft money, the incentives…to \nexploit [26 U.S.C. §527] organizations will only increase”). Our Nation’s speech dynamic is changing, and \ninformative voices should not have to circumvent onerous restrictions to exercise their First Amendment \nrights. Speakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites, talking points, and scripted \nmessages that dominate the 24-hour news cycle. Corporations, like individuals, do not have monolithic \nviews. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise, leaving them the best equipped to \npoint out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts, including the speech of candidates and elected officials.",

David Lucas paid $975,000 for two residential parcels on the Isle of Palms near Charleston, South Carolina. \nHis intention was to build houses on them. Two years later, the South Carolina legislature passed a statute \nthat prohibited building beachfront properties. The purpose was to leave the dunes system in place to \nmitigate the effects of hurricanes and strong storms. The South Carolina Coastal Commission created the \nrules and regulations with substantial input from the community and from experts and with protection of \nthe dune system primarily in mind. People had been building on the shoreline for years, with harmful \nresults to localities and the state treasury. When Lucas applied for permits to build two houses near the \nshoreline, his permits were rejected. He sued, arguing that the South Carolina legislation had effectively \n“taken” his property. At trial, South Carolina conceded that because of the legislation, Lucas’s property was \neffectively worth zero. Has there been a taking under the Fifth Amendment (as incorporated through the \nFourteenth Amendment), and if so, what should the state owe to Lucas? Suppose that Lucas could have \nmade an additional $1 million by building a house on each of his parcels.

The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods \nsuch as education, a highway system, lighthouses, a military for defense. \n \nTrue laissez-faire capitalism—a market free from any regulation—would not try to deal with market \nimperfections and would also allow people to freely choose products, services, and other arrangements \nthat historically have been deemed socially unacceptable. These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president.

Explain why there is any need for interference in the market by means of laws or regulations. \n \n  \n \n[1] Schechter Poultry Corp. v.

Understand how Congress controls administrative agencies. \n3. Understand how the courts can control administrative agencies. \n \n \nDuring the course of the past seventy years, a substantial debate has been conducted, often in shrill \nterms, about the legitimacy of administrative lawmaking. One criticism is that agencies are \n“captured” by the industry they are directed to regulate. Another is that they overregulate, stifling \nindividual initiative and the ability to compete. During the 1960s and 1970s, a massive outpouring of \nfederal law created many new agencies and greatly strengthened the hands of existing ones. In the \nlate 1970s during the Carter administration, Congress began to deregulate American society, and \nderegulation increased under the Reagan administration. But the accounting frauds of WorldCom, \nEnron, and others led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the financial meltdown of 2008 has \nled to reregulation of the financial sector. It remains to be seen whether the Deepwater Horizon oil \nblowout of 2010 will lead to more environmental regulations or a rethinking on how to make \nagencies more effective regulators. \n \nAdministrative agencies are the focal point of controversy because they are policy-making bodies, \nincorporating facets of legislative, executive, and judicial power in a hybrid form that fits uneasily at \nbest in the framework of American government (see Figure 5.1 \"Major Administrative Agencies of the \nUnited States\"). They are necessarily at the center of tugging and hauling by the legislature, the \nexecutive branch, and the judiciary, each of which has different means of exercising political control \nover them. In early 1990, for example, the Bush administration approved a Food and Drug \nAdministration regulation that limited disease-prevention claims by food packagers, reversing a \nposition by the Reagan administration in 1987 permitting such claims. \n \nFigure 5.1 Major Administrative Agencies of the United States \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n214 \n \n \nLegislative Control \nCongress can always pass a law repealing a regulation that an agency promulgates. Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control",

Describe the “exhaustion of remedies” requirement. \n2. Detail various strategies for obtaining judicial review of agency rules. \n3. Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government. \n \n \nNeither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most \nfederal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must \novercome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly \naffected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as \nfurther appeal within the agency must have been exhausted. \n \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n224 \nBefore you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to \nreconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there \nmust have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision \nto the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n•",

While it is difficult to show that \nan agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception. The Secretary would make it the rule. Invoking the Walsh-\nHealey Act of 1936, 41 U.S.C. § 35 et seq., the Secretary attempts to support a conclusion that all \nbusinesses involved in interstate commerce have long been subjected to close supervision of employee \nsafety and health conditions.

Explain how criminal law differs from civil law. \n2. Categorize the various types of crimes and define the most serious felonies. \n3. Discuss and question the criminal “intent” of a corporation. \n4. Explain basic criminal procedure and the rights of criminal defendants. \n \n \nAt times, unethical behavior by businesspeople can be extreme enough that society will respond by \ncriminalizing certain kinds of activities. Ponzi schemes, arson, various kinds of fraud, embezzlement, \nracketeering, foreign corrupt practices, tax evasion, and insider trading are just a few. A corporation \ncan face large fines, and corporate managers can face both fines and jail sentences for violating \ncriminal laws. This chapter aims to explain how criminal law differs from civil law, to discuss various \ntypes of crimes, and to relate the basic principles of criminal procedure. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n241 \n6.1 The Nature of Criminal Law \n \nCriminal law is the most ancient branch of the law. Many wise observers have tried to define and \nexplain it, but the explanations often include many complex and subtle distinctions. A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time. For example, \nwhile cocaine use was legal in the United States at one time, it is now a controlled substance, and \nunauthorized use is now a crime. Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use began \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n242 \nto become widespread, and in some states its use or possession was a felony. Now, some states make \nit legal to use or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set",

In each case, there must be \nboth an act and some mens rea (criminal intent). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n244 \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve? \n2. Why is ignorance of the law no excuse? Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be \ncomplicated and sometimes ambiguous? \n \n \n \n \n6.2 Types of Crimes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

If the finance company repossesses the car, the \ncustomer—who got a new car at a discount because of his false representation—cannot be said to have \ntaken the new car by larceny or embezzlement. Nevertheless, he tricked the dealer into selling, and the \ndealer will have lost the value of the repossessed car. Obviously, the customer is guilty of a criminal act; \nthe statutes outlawing it refer to this trickery as the crime of false pretenses, defined as obtaining \nownership of the property of another by making untrue representations of fact with intent to defraud. \n \nA number of problems have arisen in the judicial interpretation of false-pretense statutes. One concerns \nwhether the taking is permanent or only temporary. The case of State v. Mills (Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows \nthe subtle questions that can be presented and the dangers inherent in committing “a little fraud.” \n \nIn the Mills case, the claim was that a mortgage instrument dealing with one parcel of land was used \ninstead for another. This is a false representation of fact. Suppose, by contrast, that a person \nmisrepresents his state of mind: “I will pay you back tomorrow,” he says, knowing full well that he does \nnot intend to. Can such a misrepresentation amount to false pretenses punishable as a criminal offense? \nIn most jurisdictions it cannot. A false-pretense violation relates to a past event or existing fact, not to a \nstatement of intention. If it were otherwise, anyone failing to pay a debt might find himself facing criminal \nprosecution, and business would be less prone to take risks. \n \nThe problem of proving intent is especially difficult when a person has availed himself of the services of \nanother without paying. A common example is someone leaving a restaurant without paying for the meal. \nIn most states, this is specifically defined in the statutes as theft of services. \n \nReceiving Stolen Property \nOne who engages in receiving stolen property with knowledge that it is stolen is guilty of a felony or \nmisdemeanor, depending on the value of the property. The receipt need not be personal; if the property is \ndelivered to a place under the control of the receiver, then he is deemed to have received it. “Knowledge” \nis construed broadly: not merely actual knowledge, but (correct) belief and suspicion (strong enough not \nto investigate for fear that the property will turn out to have been stolen) are sufficient for conviction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n249 \n \nForgery \nForgery is false writing of a document of legal significance (or apparent legal significance!) with intent to \ndefraud. It includes the making up of a false document or the alteration of an existing one. The writing \nneed not be done by hand but can be by any means—typing, printing, and so forth. Documents commonly \nthe subject of forgery are negotiable instruments (checks, money orders, and the like), deeds, receipts, \ncontracts, and bills of lading. The forged instrument must itself be false, not merely contain a falsehood. If \nyou fake your neighbor’s signature on one of his checks made out to cash, you have committed forgery. \nBut if you sign a check of your own that is made out to cash, knowing that there is no money in your \nchecking account, the instrument is not forged, though the act may be criminal if done with the intent to \ndefraud. \n \nThe mere making of a forged instrument is unlawful. So is the “uttering” (or presentation) of such an \ninstrument, whether or not the one uttering it actually forged it. The usual example of a false signature is \nby no means the only way to commit forgery. If done with intent to defraud, the backdating of a \ndocument, the modification of a corporate name, or the filling in of lines left blank on a form can all \nconstitute forgery. \n \nExtortion \nUnder common law, extortion could only be committed by a government official, who corruptly \ncollected an unlawful fee under color of office. A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat",

It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n252 \nViolations of the Food and Drug Act \nThe federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits any person or corporation from sending into \ninterstate commerce any adulterated or misbranded food, drug, cosmetics, or related device. For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec. (a)(1) \n10 years maximum (20 years second offense) \nTrespassing in a government computer \nSec. (a)(3) \n1 year (5) \nCompromising the confidentiality of a computer \nSec. (a)(2) \n1 year (10)",

The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense. If Barney (who has poor sight), shoots at a tree stump, thinking it is his \nneighbor, Ralph, intending to kill him, has he committed an attempt? Many courts would hold that he has \nnot. But the distinction between factual impossibility and legal impossibility is not always clear, and the \ntrend seems to be to punish the intended attempt. \n \nConspiracy \nUnder both federal and state laws, it is a separate offense to work with others toward the commission of a \ncrime. When two or more people combine to carry out an unlawful purpose, they are engaged in a \nconspiracy. The law of conspiracy is quite broad, especially when it is used by prosecutors in connection \nwith white-collar crimes. Many people can be swept up in the net of conspiracy, because it is unnecessary \nto show that the actions they took were sufficient to constitute either the crime or an attempt. Usually, the \nprosecution needs to show only (1) an agreement and (2) a single overt act in furtherance of the \nconspiracy. Thus if three people agree to rob a bank, and if one of them goes to a store to purchase a gun \nto be used in the holdup, the three can be convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery. Even the purchase \nof an automobile to be used as the getaway car could support a conspiracy conviction. \n \nThe act of any one of the conspirators is imputed to the other members of the conspiracy. It does not \nmatter, for instance, that only one of the bank robbers fired the gun that killed a guard. All can be \nconvicted of murder. That is so even if one of the conspirators was stationed as a lookout several blocks \naway and even if he specifically told the others that his agreement to cooperate would end “just as soon as \nthere is shooting.” \n \nAgency and Corporations \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n257 \nA person can be guilty of a crime if he acts through another. Again, the usual reason for “imputing” the \nguilt of the actor to another is that both were engaged in a conspiracy. But imputation of guilt is not \nlimited to a conspiracy. The agent may be innocent even though he participates. A corporate officer \ndirects a junior employee to take a certain bag and deliver it to the officer’s home. The employee \nreasonably believes that the officer is entitled to the bag. Unbeknownst to the employee, the bag contains \nmoney that belongs to the company, and the officer wishes to keep it. This is not a conspiracy. The \nemployee is not guilty of larceny, but the officer is, because the agent’s act is imputed to him. \n \nSince intent is a necessary component of crime, an agent’s intent cannot be imputed to his principal if the \nprincipal did not share the intent. The company president tells her sales manager, “Go make sure our \nbiggest customer renews his contract for next year”—by which she meant, “Don’t ignore our biggest \ncustomer.” Standing before the customer’s purchasing agent, the sales manager threatens to tell the \npurchasing agent’s boss that the purchasing agent has been cheating on his expense account, unless he \nsigns a new contract. The sales manager could be convicted of blackmail, but the company president could \nnot. \n \nCan a corporation be guilty of a crime? For many types of crimes, the guilt of individual employees may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus the antitrust statutes explicitly state that the corporation may be \nconvicted and fined for violations by employees. This is so even though the shareholders are the ones who \nultimately must pay the price—and who may have had nothing to do with the crime nor the power to stop \nit. The law of corporate criminal responsibility has been changing in recent years. The tendency is to hold \nthe corporation liable under criminal law if the act has been directed by a responsible officer or group \nwithin the corporation (the president or board of directors). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAlthough proving the intent to commit a crime (the mens rea) is essential, the intent can be established by \ninference (circumstantially). Conspirators may not actually commit a crime, for example, but in preparing for a \ncriminal act, they may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy. Certain corporate officers, as well, may not be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n258 \ndirectly committing criminal acts but may be held criminally responsible for acts of their agents and \ncontractors. \n \n \nEXERCISES",

Explain why criminal law generally requires that the defendant charged with a crime have criminal \"intent.\" \n2. Know and explain the possible excuses relating to responsibility that are legally recognized by courts, \nincluding lack of capacity. \n \n \nIn General \nThe mens rea requirement depends on the nature of the crime and all the circumstances surrounding the \nact. In general, though, the requirement means that the accused must in some way have intended the \ncriminal consequences of his act. Suppose, for example, that Charlie gives Gabrielle a poison capsule to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n259 \nswallow. That is the act. If Gabrielle dies, is Charlie guilty of murder? The answer depends on what his \nstate of mind was. Obviously, if he gave it to her intending to kill her, the act was murder. \nWhat if he gave it to her knowing that the capsule was poison but believing that it would only make her \nmildly ill? The act is still murder, because we are all liable for the consequences of any intentional act that \nmay cause harm to others. But suppose that Gabrielle had asked Harry for aspirin, and he handed her two \npills that he reasonably believed to be aspirin (they came from the aspirin bottle and looked like aspirin) \nbut that turned out to be poison, the act would not be murder, because he had neither intent nor a state of \nknowledge from which intent could be inferred. \n \nNot every criminal law requires criminal intent as an ingredient of the crime. Many regulatory codes \ndealing with the public health and safety impose strict requirements. Failure to adhere to such \nrequirements is a violation, whether or not the violator had mens rea. The United States v. \nPark case, Section 6.7 \"Cases\", a decision of the US Supreme Court, shows the different considerations \ninvolved in mens rea. \n \nExcuses That Limit or Overcome Responsibility \nMistake of Fact and Mistake of Law \nOrdinarily, ignorance of the law is not an excuse. If you believe that it is permissible to turn right on a red \nlight but the city ordinance prohibits it, your belief, even if reasonable, does not excuse your violation of \nthe law. Under certain circumstances, however, ignorance of law will be excused. If a statute imposes \ncriminal penalties for an action taken without a license, and if the government official responsible for \nissuing the license formally tells you that you do not need one (though in fact you do), a conviction for \nviolating the statute cannot stand. In rare cases, a lawyer’s advice, contrary to the statute, will be held to \nexcuse the client, but usually the client is responsible for his attorney’s mistakes. Otherwise, as it is said, \nthe lawyer would be superior to the law. \n \nIgnorance or mistake of fact more frequently will serve as an excuse. If you take a coat from a restaurant, \nbelieving it to be yours, you cannot be convicted of larceny if it is not. Your honest mistake of fact negates \nthe requisite intent. In general, the rule is that a mistaken belief of fact will excuse criminal responsibility \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n260 \nif (1) the belief is honestly held, (2) it is reasonable to hold it, and (3) the act would not have been criminal \nif the facts were as the accused supposed them to have been. \n \nEntrapment \nOne common technique of criminal investigation is the use of an undercover agent or decoy—the \npoliceman who poses as a buyer of drugs from a street dealer or the elaborate “sting” operations in which \nostensibly stolen goods are “sold” to underworld “fences.” Sometimes these methods are the only way by \nwhich certain kinds of crime can be rooted out and convictions secured. \n \nBut a rule against entrapment limits the legal ability of the police to play the role of criminals. The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to",

The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff.

Describe the most significant constitutional rights of defendants in US courts, and name the source of \nthese rights. \n2. Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it. But it remains \ngenerally true that the prosecutor may not use evidence willfully taken by the police in violation of \nconstitutional rights generally, and most often in the violation of Fourth Amendment rights. (The fruits of \na coerced confession are also excluded.) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n266 \n \nDouble Jeopardy \nThe Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from prosecuting a person twice for the same offense. \nThe amendment says that no person shall be “subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of \nlife or limb.” If a defendant is acquitted, the government may not appeal. If a defendant is convicted and \nhis conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime. \n \nSelf-Incrimination \nThe Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be \ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”). The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not \nfirst advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise \nhim during the questioning. [1] These so-called Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases \nthat have made this branch of jurisprudence especially complex. \n \n \nSpeedy Trial \nThe Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try defendants speedily. How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n267 \nThe Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have the right to confront witnesses against him.",

Mills \n96 Ariz. 377, 396 P.2d 5 (Ariz. 1964) \n \nLOCKWOOD, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE \n \nDefendants appeal from a conviction on two counts of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of \nAR.S. §§ 13-661.A3. and 13-663.A1. The material facts, viewed “…in the light most favorable to sustaining \nthe conviction,” are as follows: Defendant William Mills was a builder and owned approximately 150 \nhomes in Tucson in December, 1960. Mills conducted his business in his home. In 1960 defendant \nWinifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and \nreceiving clients who came to the office. \n \nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and \nanother at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n270 \nthe complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not \nfirst mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two \nvacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a \ncomplaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses. \n \nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the \ninformation. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the \ncrime of theft. Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert \nthat complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny. Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory \ninterest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a \npermanent deprivation is appropriate to the former. Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan \nobtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n271 \n \n* * * \n \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer \nunder § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 331 \n(k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943). Acme Markets, Inc., is a \nnational retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general \nwarehouses, and four special warehouses. Its headquarters, including the office of the president, \nrespondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been \nshipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore \nwarehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n272 \nrodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the \nfood’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § \n331 (k). \n \nAcme pleaded guilty to each count of the information. Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at \ntrial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by \nletter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar \nconditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning \nevidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of \nthe Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the \nwarehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been \nimprovement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building \nand in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” \n \nThe Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who \ninformed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection. \nThere was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on \nbehalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions \ndiscovered by both inspections. The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs \nand assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company \nand read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer. He testified that respondent \nfunctioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain \nthings, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of \nseeing that they all work together.” \n \nAt the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \nground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and \nDrug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 \n(1943), was controlling. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n273 \n \nRespondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating",

Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the \ndefendant has deliberately committed a wrong with malicious intent or has otherwise done something \noutrageous. \n \nPunitive damages are rarely allowed in negligence cases for that reason. But if someone sets out \nintentionally and maliciously to hurt another person, punitive damages may well be appropriate. Punitive \ndamages are intended not only to punish the wrongdoer, by exacting an additional and sometimes heavy \npayment (the exact amount is left to the discretion of jury and judge), but also to deter others from similar \nconduct. The punitive damage award has been subject to heavy criticism in recent years in cases in which \nit has been awarded against manufacturers. One fear is that huge damage awards on behalf of a multitude \nof victims could swiftly bankrupt the defendant. Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are \ntaxable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are three kinds of torts, and in two of them (negligent torts and strict liability torts), damages are \nusually limited to making the victim whole through an enforceable judgment for money damages. These \ncompensatory damages awarded by a court accomplish only approximate justice for the injuries or property \ndamage caused by a tortfeasor. Tort laws go a step further toward deterrence, beyond compensation to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n287 \nplaintiff, in occasionally awarding punitive damages against a defendant. These are almost always in cases \nwhere an intentional tort has been committed. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is deterrence needed for intentional torts (where punitive damages are awarded) rather than \nnegligent torts? \n2. Why are costs imposed on others without their consent problematic for a market economy? What if the \nlaw did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor? What would a totally nonlitigious society \nbe like? \n \n \n \n \n7.2 Intentional Torts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Distinguish intentional torts from other kinds of torts. \n2. Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution \nMalicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that \nthere was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime. The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name.

The plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere complaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the claim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the plaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained."

                    "answer": "Defamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the spoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the defamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. The Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.” [3] A statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. Moreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be libeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a third person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but the dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the statements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. The statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A statement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major network weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show that the words were aimed at them.

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find \nthemselves the objects of public scrutiny. Whether a private person is or is not a public figure is a difficult \nquestion that has so far eluded rigorous definition and has been answered only from case to case. A CEO \nof a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private figure unless he puts himself in the public \neye—for example, by starring in the company’s television commercials. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n295 \n \nInvasion of Privacy \nThe right of privacy—the right “to be let alone”—did not receive judicial recognition until the twentieth \ncentury, and its legal formulation is still evolving. In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country.

If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot? (Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold. \nThis limitation was known as the rule of privity. And users who were not immediate purchasers were said \nnot to be in privity with a supplier or manufacturer. In 1916, Judge Benjamin N. Cardozo, then on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n300 \nNew York Court of Appeals, penned an opinion in a celebrated case that exploded the theory of privity, \nthough it would take half a century before the last state—Mississippi in 1966—would fall in line. \nDetermining a duty of care can be a vexing problem. Physicians, for example, are bound by principles of \nmedical ethics to respect the confidences of their patients. Suppose a patient tells a psychiatrist that he \nintends to kill his girlfriend. Does the physician then have a higher legal duty to warn prospective victim? \nThe California Supreme Court has said yes. [1] \n \nEstablishing a breach of the duty of due care where the defendant has violated a statute or municipal \nordinance is eased considerably with the doctrine of negligence per se, a doctrine common to all US \nstate courts. If a legislative body sets a minimum standard of care for particular kinds of acts to protect a \ncertain set of people from harm and a violation of that standard causes harm to someone in that set, the \ndefendant is negligent per se. If Harvey is driving sixty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five-mile-per-hour \nzone when he crashes into Haley’s car and the police accident report establishes that or he otherwise \nadmits to going ten miles per hour over the speed limit, Haley does not have to prove that Harvey has \nbreached a duty of due care. She will only have to prove that the speeding was an actual and proximate \ncause of the collision and will also have to prove the extent of the resulting damages to her. \n \nCausation: Actual Cause and Proximate Cause \n“For want of a nail, the kingdom was lost,” as the old saying has it. Virtually any cause of an injury can be \ntraced to some preceding cause. The problem for the law is to know when to draw the line between causes \nthat are immediate and causes too remote for liability reasonably to be assigned to them. In tort theory, \nthere are two kinds of causes that a plaintiff must prove: actual cause and proximate \ncause. Actual cause (causation in fact) can be found if the connection between the defendant’s act \nand the plaintiff’s injuries passes the “but for” test: if an injury would not have occurred “but for” the \ndefendant’s conduct, then the defendant is the cause of the injury. Still, this is not enough causation to \ncreate liability. The injuries to the plaintiff must also be foreseeable, or not “too remote,” for the \ndefendant’s act to create liability. This is proximate cause: a cause that is not too remote or \nunforseeable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n301 \nSuppose that the person who was injured was not one whom a reasonable person could have expected to \nbe harmed. Such a situation was presented in one of the most famous US tort cases, Palsgraf v. Long \nIsland Railroad (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"), which was decided by Judge Benjamin Cardozo. Although Judge \nCardozo persuaded four of his seven brethren to side with his position, the closeness of the case \ndemonstrates the difficulty that unforeseeable consequences and unforeseeable plaintiffs present. \n \nDamages \nFor a plaintiff to win a tort case, she must allege and prove that she was injured. The fear that she might \nbe injured in the future is not a sufficient basis for a suit. This rule has proved troublesome in medical \nmalpractice and industrial disease cases. A doctor’s negligent act or a company’s negligent exposure of a \nworker to some form of contamination might not become manifest in the body for years. In the meantime, \nthe tort statute of limitations might have run out, barring the victim from suing at all. An increasing \nnumber of courts have eased the plaintiff’s predicament by ruling that the statute of limitations does not \nbegin to run until the victim discovers that she has been injured or contracted a disease. \n \nThe law allows an exception to the general rule that damages must be shown when the plaintiff stands in \ndanger of immediate injury from a hazardous activity. If you discover your neighbor experimenting with \nexplosives in his basement, you could bring suit to enjoin him from further experimentation, even though \nhe has not yet blown up his house—and yours.",

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve. Since it is frequently difficult to make out the requisite proof, the law \nallows certain presumptions and rules of evidence that ease the plaintiff’s task, on the ground that without \nthem substantial injustice would be done. One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and \nin any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which \ninevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances. \n \nIn many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence \nor will constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence. The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining \nprecisely how the accident occurred. A defendant can always offer evidence that he acted reasonably—for \nexample, that the flour barrel was securely fastened and that a bolt of lightning, for which he was not \nresponsible, broke its bands, causing it to roll out the window. But testimony by the factory employees \nthat they secured the barrel, in the absence of any further explanation, will not usually serve to rebut the \ninference. That the defendant was negligent does not conclude the inquiry or automatically entitle the \nplaintiff to a judgment. Tort law provides the defendant with several excuses, some of which are discussed \nbriefly in the next section. \nExcuses \nThere are more excuses (defenses) than are listed here, but contributory negligence or comparative \nnegligence, assumption of risk, and act of God are among the principal defenses that will completely or \npartially excuse the negligence of the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n303 \nContributory and Comparative Negligence \nUnder an old common-law rule, it was a complete defense to show that the plaintiff in a negligence suit \nwas himself negligent. Even if the plaintiff was only mildly negligent, most of the fault being chargeable to \nthe defendant, the court would dismiss the suit if the plaintiff’s conduct contributed to his injury. In a few \nstates today, this rule of contributory negligence is still in effect. Although referred to as negligence, \nthe rule encompasses a narrower form than that with which the defendant is charged, because the \nplaintiff’s only error in such cases is in being less careful of himself than he might have been, whereas the \ndefendant is charged with conduct careless toward others. This rule was so manifestly unjust in many \ncases that most states, either by statute or judicial decision, have changed to some version \nof comparative negligence. Under the rule of comparative negligence, damages are apportioned \naccording to the defendant’s degree of culpability. For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.",

The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways.

(“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the \nplaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it. On the other hand, it is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n304 \neasy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of \ncommunity knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations. When the plaintiff has no \nreal alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to \nlight the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it). \n \nAt the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers \ninjured on the job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment. This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes \ncalled, is not an excuse but a defense premised on a lack of causation. If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability. For example, a work crew failed to remove residue explosive gas \nfrom an oil barge. Lightning hit the barge, exploded the gas, and injured several workmen. The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment. This rule of vicarious liability \nis often called respondeat superior, meaning that the higher authority must respond to claims brought \nagainst one of its agents. Respondeat superior is not limited to the employment relationship but extends \nto a number of other agency relationships as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now",

(Some states limit liability to the manufacturer.) But it is available in \nthe United States and initially was created by a California Supreme Court decision in the 1962 case \nof Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. \n \nIn Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and \nmanufactured by the defendant. He was experienced in using power tools and was injured while using the \napproved lathe attachment to the Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice. The case was decided on the \npremise that Greenman had done nothing wrong in using the machine but that the machine had a defect \nthat was “latent” (not easily discoverable by the consumer). Rather than decide the case based on \nwarranties, or requiring that Greenman prove how the defendant had been negligent, Justice Traynor \nfound for the plaintiff based on the overall social utility of strict liability in cases of defective products. \nAccording to his decision, the purpose of such liability is to ensure that the “cost of injuries resulting from \ndefective products is borne by the manufacturers…rather than by the injured persons who are powerless \nto protect themselves.” \n \nToday, the majority of US states recognize strict liability for defective products, although some states limit \nstrict liability actions to damages for personal injuries rather than property damage. Injured plaintiffs \nhave to prove the product caused the harm but do not have to prove exactly how the manufacturer was \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n308 \ncareless. Purchasers of the product, as well as injured guests, bystanders, and others with no direct \nrelationship with the product, may sue for damages caused by the product. \n \nThe Restatement of the Law of Torts, Section 402(a), was originally issued in 1964. It is a widely accepted \nstatement of the liabilities of sellers of goods for defective products. The Restatement specifies six \nrequirements, all of which must be met for a plaintiff to recover using strict liability for a product that the \nplaintiff claims is defective: \n \n1. The product must be in a defective condition when the defendant sells it. \n2. The defendant must normally be engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing the \nproduct. \n3. The product must be unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer because of its defective \ncondition. \n4. The plaintiff must incur physical harm to self or to property by using or consuming the product. \n5. The defective condition must be the proximate cause of the injury or damage. \n6. The goods must not have been substantially changed from the time the product was sold to the time the \ninjury was sustained. \nSection 402(a) also explicitly makes clear that a defendant can be held liable even though the defendant \nhas exercised “all possible care.” Thus in a strict liability case, the plaintiff does not need to show “fault” \n(or negligence). \n \nFor defendants, who can include manufacturers, distributors, processors, assemblers, packagers, bottlers, \nretailers, and wholesalers, there are a number of defenses that are available, including assumption of risk, \nproduct misuse and comparative negligence, commonly known dangers, and the knowledgeable-user \ndefense. We have already seen assumption of risk and comparative negligence in terms of negligence \nactions; the application of these is similar in products-liability actions. \n \nUnder product misuse, a plaintiff who uses a product in an unexpected and unusual way will not recover \nfor injuries caused by such misuse. For example, suppose that someone uses a rotary lawn mower to trim \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n309 \na hedge and that after twenty minutes of such use loses control because of its weight and suffers serious \ncuts to his abdomen after dropping it. Here, there would be a defense of product misuse, as well as \ncontributory negligence. Consider the urban (or Internet) legend of Mervin Gratz, who supposedly put his \nWinnebago on autopilot to go back and make coffee in the kitchen, then recovered millions after his \nWinnebago turned over and he suffered serious injuries. There are multiple defenses to this alleged \naction; these would include the defenses of contributory negligence, comparative negligence, and product \nmisuse. (There was never any such case, and certainly no such recovery; it is not known who started this \nlegend, or why.) \n \nAnother defense against strict liability as a cause of action is the knowledgeable user defense. If the \nparents of obese teenagers bring a lawsuit against McDonald’s, claiming that its fast-food products are \ndefective and that McDonald’s should have warned customers of the adverse health effects of eating its \nproducts, a defense based on the knowledgeable user is available. In one case, the court found that the",

University of Denver \n744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n313 \nOn June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while \nattempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline. The injury rendered him a \nquadriplegic. The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated \non the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus. At the time of his injury, \nWhitlock was twenty years old, attended the University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, \nwhere he held the office of acting house manager. The property on which the Beta house was located was \nleased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of \nDenver. \n \nWhitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines. He began using trampolines in junior high \nschool and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip. Whitlock testified that he \nutilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months. He began jumping on \nthe trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977. Whitlock recounted that in the fall and \nspring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily. He testified further that \nprior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between \nseventy-five and one hundred times. \n \nDuring the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta \nhouse, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken \nuntil 2:00 p.m. on June 19. He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 \np.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at \nthe Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of \nthe fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area. \nAs Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his \nhead, causing his neck to break. \n \nWhitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta \nTheta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n314 \nthe Beta Theta Pi organizations. Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except \nthe University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial. The jury returned a \nverdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000. The jury attributed twenty-eight \npercent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to \nthe conduct of the University. The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the \nUniversity to $ 5,256,000.",

According to the \nevidence, there are only two possible sources of a special relationship out of which such a duty could arise \nin this case: the status of Whitlock as a student at the University, and the lease between the University and \nthe fraternity of which Whitlock was a member. We first consider the adequacy of the student-university \nrelationship as a possible basis for imposing a duty on the University to control or prohibit the use of the \ntrampoline, and then examine the provisions of the lease for that same purpose. \n \nA. \nThe student-university relationship has been scrutinized in several jurisdictions, and it is generally agreed \nthat a university is not an insurer of its students’ safety.

Such an allocation of responsibility would “produce a repressive and \ninhospitable environment, largely inconsistent with the objectives of a modern college \neducation.” Beach, 726 P.2d at 419. \n \nThe evidence demonstrates that only in limited instances has the University attempted to impose \nregulations or restraints on the private recreational pursuits of its students, and the students have not \nlooked to the University to assure the safety of their recreational choices.

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932. A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance. They are as \nclose to “black letter” rules of law as exist anywhere in the American legal system for judge-made \n(common) law. \n \nStatutory Law: The Uniform Commercial Code \nCommon law contract principles govern contracts for real estate and for services, obviously very \nimportant areas of law. But in one area the common law has been superseded by an important statute: the \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC), especially Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n332 \nA Brief History \nThe UCC is a model law developed by the American law Institute and the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or another in all fifty states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the American territories. It is the only “national” law not enacted by Congress. \n \nBefore the UCC was written, commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state. This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections. Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued. This version, known as \nthe 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky. In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted",

By 1966, only three states and two territories had failed to enact \nany version: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico. \n \nMeanwhile, non-uniform provisions continued to be enacted in various states, particularly in Article 9, to \nwhich 337 such amendments had been made. In 1971, a redraft of that article was readied and the 1972 \nOfficial Text was published. By that time, Louisiana was the only holdout. Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2). One more major change was made, a revision of \nArticle 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment \nsecurities from seller to purchaser. This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for \nsale other than the money in which the price is to be paid. . . .” The only contracts and agreements covered \nby Article 2 are those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \n \nIn certain cases, the courts have difficulty in determining the nature of the object of a sales contract. The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f \nthe permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption . . . unquestionably an implied warranty of \nfitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected \nthe defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the \nliability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion. \n \nIn two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and",

            "chunk": "the adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing. For example, Tom \nowes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out. The \ncontract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n339 \nor actually pays part of the debt. (However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n340 \n1.

The parties entered into the contract with capacity to make a contract; and \n5. The agreement is in the proper form (something in writing, if required). \n \nThe Agreement: Offer and Acceptance \nThe core of a legal contract is the agreement between the parties. That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment. The company refused, claiming that the statement was made \nin jest (the audience before the commission had laughed when the offer was made). The court disagreed, \nholding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: \n \n(I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, \nthen the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended. It is the objective \nmanifestations of the offeror that count and not secret, unexpressed intentions. If a party’s words \nor acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree in regard to the matter \nin question, that agreement is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real but \nunexpressed state of the party’s mind on the subject. [1] \n \nAn offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain such that it would be reasonable for \nanother individual to conclude that assent to the offer would complete the bargain. Offers must be \ncommunicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent. \n \nTo constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance of the offer. The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the",

Offers must be communicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent. An acceptance is a manifestation of assent to the terms of an offer. The offeree must manifest his assent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offeror. Complications arise when an offer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not effective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner specified by the offeror. If the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the offeree accepts in the manner specified by the offeror."

It is implied that the offeree can use the same means used \nby the offeror or a means of communication customary to the industry. For example, the use of the postal \nservice was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method \nused to transmit the offer. Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) \nhas an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts. [2] \nConsideration \nConsideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the \ncontracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made. \nConsider the following three “contracts”: \n \n1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts. \n2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15. Lou accepts. \n3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house. Lou accepts. \n \nThe question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In American law, only situation 2 is a binding \ncontract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give \nup something to the benefit of the other. \n \nThe question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and \nin other cultures. For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, \nalthough in some states it creates a presumption of consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has \nabolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n344 \nThe existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is \nto be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the \npromise (the promisee). That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book.",

In cases of promissory \nestoppel, the courts will enforce promises without consideration. Simply \nstated, promissory estoppel means that the courts will stop the promisor from claiming that there was \nno consideration. The doctrine of promissory estoppel is invoked in the interests of justice when three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n345 \nconditions are met: (1) the promise is one that the promisor should reasonably expect to induce the \npromisee to take action or forbear from taking action of a definite and substantial character; (2) the action \nor forbearance is taken; and (3) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise. \nTimko served on the board of trustees of a school. He recommended that the school purchase a building \nfor a substantial sum of money, and to induce the trustees to vote for the purchase, he promised to help \nwith the purchase and to pay at the end of five years the purchase price less the down payment. At the end \nof four years, Timko died. The school sued his estate, which defended on the ground that there was no \nconsideration for the promise. Timko was promised or given nothing in return, and the purchase of the \nbuilding was of no direct benefit to him (which would have made the promise enforceable as a unilateral \ncontract). The court ruled that under the three-pronged promissory estoppel test, Timko’s estate was \nliable. [3] \n \nIllegality \nIn general, illegal contracts are unenforceable. The courts must grapple with two types of illegalities: (1) \nstatutory violations (e.g., the practice of law by a non-lawyer is forbidden by statute), and (2) violations of \npublic policy not expressly declared unlawful by statute, but so declared by the courts. \n \nCapacity \nA contract is a meeting of minds. If someone lacks mental capacity to understand what he is assenting \nto—or that he is assenting to anything—it is unreasonable to hold him to the consequences of his act. \n \nThe general rule is that persons younger than eighteen can avoid their contracts. Although the age of \nmajority was lowered in most states during the 1970s to correspond to the Twenty-sixth Amendment \n(ratified in 1971, guaranteeing the right to vote at eighteen), some states still put the age of majority at \ntwenty-one. Legal rights for those under twenty-one remain ambiguous, however. Although eighteen-\nyear-olds may assent to binding contracts, not all creditors and landlords believe it, and they may require \nparents to cosign. For those under twenty-one, there are also legal impediments to holding certain kinds \nof jobs, signing certain kinds of contracts, marrying, leaving home, and drinking alcohol. There is as yet \nno uniform set of rules. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n346 \nThe exact day on which the disability of minority vanishes also varies. The old common law rule put it on \nthe day before the twenty-first birthday. Many states have changed this rule so that majority commences \non the day of the eighteenth (or twenty-first) birthday. \n \nA minor’s contract is voidable, not void. A child wishing to avoid the contract need do nothing positive to \ndisaffirm; the defense of minority to a lawsuit is sufficient. Although the adult cannot enforce the contract, \nthe child can (which is why it is said to be voidable, not void). \n \nWhen the minor becomes an adult, he has two choices: he may ratify the contract or disaffirm it. She \nmay ratify explicitly; no further consideration is necessary. She may also do so by implication—for \ninstance, by continuing to make payments or retaining goods for an unreasonable period of time. (In \nsome states, a court may ratify the contract before the child becomes an adult. In California, for example, \na state statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a contract with a child actor in order to \nprevent the child from disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional wages. As quid pro \nquo, the court can order the producer to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the child’s \nparents or guardians cannot invade.)

However, in two situations, a minor might incur greater \nliability: contracts for necessities and misrepresentation of age. \n \nContract for Necessities \nAt common law, a “necessity” was defined as an essential need of a human being: food, medicine, \nclothing, and shelter. In recent years, however, the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many \nstates today necessities include property and services that will enable the minor to earn a living and to \nprovide for those dependent on him. If the contract is executory, the minor can simply disaffirm. If the \ncontract has been executed, however, the minor must face more onerous consequences. Although he will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n347 \nnot be required to perform under the contract, he will be liable under a theory of “quasi-contract” for the \nreasonable value of the necessity. \n \nMisrepresentation of Age \nIn most states, a minor may misrepresent his age and disaffirm in accordance with the general rule, \nbecause that’s what kids do, misrepresent their age. That the adult reasonably believed the minor was also \nan adult is of no consequence in a contract suit. But some states have enacted statutes that make the \nminor liable in certain situations. A Michigan statute, for instance, prohibits a minor from disaffirming if \nhe has signed a “separate instrument containing only the statement of age, date of signing and the \nsignature:” And some states “estop” him from claiming to be a minor if he falsely represented himself as \nan adult in making the ·contract. “Estoppel” is a refusal by the courts on equitable grounds to listen to an \notherwise valid defense; unless the minor can return the consideration, the contract will be enforced. \n \nContracts made by an insane or intoxicated person are also said to have been made by a person lacking \ncapacity. In general, such contracts are voidable by the person when capacity is regained (or by the \nperson’s legal representative if capacity is not regained). \n \nForm \nAs a general rule, a contract need not be in writing to be enforceable. An oral agreement to pay a high-\nfashion model $1 million to pose for a photograph is as binding as if the language of the deal were printed \non vellum and signed in the presence of twenty bishops. For centuries, however, a large exception has \ngrown up around the Statute of Frauds, first enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name “An \nAct for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries.” The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the \nfraud that occurs when one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not in fact exist. \nThe two sections dealing with contracts read as follows: \n[Sect. 4] ...no action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator upon any \nspecial promise, to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to charge the \ndefendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another \nperson; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n348 \n(4) or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or \nconcerning them; (5) or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one \nyear from the making thereof; (6) unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, \nor some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged \ntherewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. \n \n[Sect. 17] ...no contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandizes, for the price of ten \npounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the \ngoods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or \nin part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made \nand signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully \nauthorized. \n \nAgain, as may be evident from the title of the act and its language, the general purpose of the law is to",

            "chunk": "right. Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is",

It therefore deals with three different relationships: between principal and agent, between principal \nand third party, and between agent and third party. These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both",

These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant. Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from",

General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent.

Recognize that the principal owes the agent duties: contract, tort, and workers’ compensation. \n \n \nAgent’s Duty to Principal \nThe agent owes the principal duties in two categories: the fiduciary duty and a set of general duties \nimposed by agency law. But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course. \n \nBut the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the \nborder of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest. The penalty for \nbreach of fiduciary duty is loss of compensation and profit and possible damages for breach of trust. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n383 \n \nDuty to Preserve Confidential Information \nTo further his objectives, a principal will usually need to reveal a number of secrets to his agent—how \nmuch he is willing to sell or pay for property, marketing strategies, and the like. Such information could \neasily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or \nwere to sell the information to those who do. The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own \npurposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or \nacquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the \nagent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books \nor memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s \nexpense.” [1] Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency. Though he is free, \nin the absence of contract, to compete with his former principal, he may not use information learned in \nthe course of his agency, such as trade secrets and customer lists. Section 9.3.3 \"Breach of Fiduciary \nDuty\", Bacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc., deals with an agent’s breach of the duty of confidentiality. \n \nOther Duties \nIn addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific \ncontract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to \nagents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts. \n \nDuty of Skill and Care \nAn agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. \nThe agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality \nfor the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are \ngreater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community. In short, \nthe agent may not lawfully do a sloppy job. [2] \n \nDuty of Good Conduct \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n384 \nIn the absence of an agreement, a principal may not ordinarily dictate how an agent must live his private \nlife. An overly fastidious florist may not instruct her truck driver to steer clear of the local bar on his way \nhome from delivering flowers at the end of the day. But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars.

A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp. These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement.

Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

This trade-off was felt to be equitable to employer and employee: the \nemployee loses the right to seek damages for pain and suffering—which can be a sizable portion of any \njury award—but in return he can avoid the time-consuming and uncertain judicial process and assure \nhimself that his medical costs and a portion of his salary will be paid—and paid promptly.

In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n• \nIs the injured person an employee? Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected. But most \ncourts have liberalized the definition of injury and now recognize that psychological trauma can \nbe real and that job stress can bring it on, as shown by the discussion of Wolfe v. Sibley, Lindsay \n& Curr Co. in Section 9.3.4 \"Workers’ Compensation: What “Injuries” Are Compensable?\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n393 \nThe agent owes the principal two categories of duties: fiduciary and general. The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent?",

Microsoft Corp. \n97 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. 1996) \n \nReinhardt, J. \n \nLarge corporations have increasingly adopted the practice of hiring temporary employees or \nindependent contractors as a means of avoiding payment of employee benefits, and thereby increasing \ntheir profits. This practice has understandably led to a number of problems, legal and otherwise. One of \nthe legal issues that sometimes arises is exemplified by this lawsuit. The named plaintiffs, who were \nclassified by Microsoft as independent contractors, seek to strip that label of its protective covering and \nto obtain for themselves certain benefits that the company provided to all of its regular or permanent \nemployees. After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). In both cases, the claims are based on their \ncontention that they are common-law employees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n399 \nMicrosoft, one of the country’s fastest growing and most successful corporations and the world’s largest \nsoftware company, produces and sells computer software internationally. It employs a core staff of \npermanent employees. It categorizes them as “regular employees” and offers them a wide variety of \nbenefits, including paid vacations, sick leave, holidays, short-term disability, group health and life \ninsurance, and pensions, as well as the two benefits involved in this appeal. Microsoft supplements its \ncore staff of employees with a pool of individuals to whom it refuses to pay fringe benefits. It previously \nclassified these individuals as “independent contractors” or “freelancers,” but prior to the filing of the \naction began classifying them as “temporary agency employees.” Freelancers were hired when Microsoft \nneeded to expand its workforce to meet the demands of new product schedules. The company did not, of \ncourse, provide them with any of the employee benefits regular employees receive. \n \nThe plaintiffs…performed services as software testers, production editors, proofreaders, formatters and \nindexers. Microsoft fully integrated the plaintiffs into its workforce: they often worked on teams along \nwith regular employees, sharing the same supervisors, performing identical functions, and working the \nsame core hours. Because Microsoft required that they work on site, they received admittance card keys, \noffice equipment and supplies from the company. \n \nFreelancers and regular employees, however, were not without their obvious distinctions. Freelancers \nwore badges of a different color, had different electronic-mail addresses, and attended a less formal \norientation than that provided to regular employees. They were not permitted to assign their work to \nothers, invited to official company functions, or paid overtime wages. In addition, they were not paid \nthrough Microsoft’s payroll department. Instead, they submitted invoices for their services, documenting \ntheir hours and the projects on which they worked, and were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment. \nThe plaintiffs were told when they were hired that, as freelancers, they would not be eligible for benefits. \nNone has contended that Microsoft ever promised them any benefits individually. All eight named \nplaintiffs signed [employment agreements] when first hired by Microsoft or soon thereafter. [One] \nincluded a provision that states that the undersigned “agrees to be responsible for all federal and state \ntaxes, withholding, social security, insurance and other benefits.” The [other one] states that “as an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n400",

Microsoft agreed.… \n \nAfter learning of the IRS rulings, the plaintiffs sought various employee benefits, including those now at \nissue: the ESPP and SPP benefits. The SPP…is a cash or deferred salary arrangement under § 401k of the \nInternal Revenue Code that permits Microsoft’s employees to save and invest up to fifteen percent of their \nincome through tax-deferred payroll deductions.…Microsoft matches fifty percent of the employee’s \ncontribution in any year, with [a maximum matching contribution]. The ESPP…permits employees to \npurchase company stock [with various rules]. \n \nMicrosoft rejected the plaintiffs’ claims for benefits, maintaining that they were independent contractors \nwho were personally responsible for all their own benefits.… \n \nThe plaintiffs brought this action, challenging the denial of benefits. \n \nMicrosoft contends that the extrinsic evidence, including the [employment agreements], demonstrates its \nintent not to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee benefits[.]…We have no doubt \nthat the company did not intend to provide freelancers or independent contractors with employee \nbenefits, and that if the plaintiffs had in fact been freelancers or independent contractors, they would not \nbe eligible under the plan. The plaintiffs, however, were not freelancers or independent contractors. They \nwere common-law employees, and the question is what, if anything, Microsoft intended with respect to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n401 \npersons who were actually common-law employees but were not known to Microsoft to be such. The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus.

First, the label used in the instruments signed by the plaintiffs does not control \ntheir employment status. Second, the employment instruments, if construed to exclude the plaintiffs from \nreceiving ESPP benefits, would conflict with the plan’s express incorporation of § 423. Although Microsoft \nmay have generally intended to exclude individuals who were in fact independent contractors, it could \nnot, consistent with its express intention to extend participation in the ESPP to all common-law \nemployees, have excluded the plaintiffs. Indeed, such an exclusion would defeat the purpose of including § \n423 in the plan, because the exclusion of common-law employees not otherwise accepted would result in \nthe loss of the plan’s tax qualification. \n \nFinally, Microsoft maintains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to ESPP benefits because the terms of the \nplan were never communicated to them and they were therefore unaware of its provisions when they \nperformed their employment services.…In any event, to the extent that knowledge of an offer of benefits is \na prerequisite, it is probably sufficient that Microsoft publicly promulgated the plan. In [Citation], the \nplaintiff was unaware of the company’s severance plan until shortly before his termination. The Oklahoma \nSupreme Court concluded nonetheless that publication of the plan was “the equivalent of constructive \nknowledge on the part of all employees not specifically excluded.” \n \nWe are not required to rely, however, on the [this] analysis or even on Microsoft’s own unwitting \nconcession. There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge. Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits. Thus, we reject Microsoft’s final argument. \n \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Microsoft and denial of \nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for the \ndetermination of any questions of individual eligibility for benefits that may remain following issuance of",

            "chunk": "9.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another. The law recognizes several types of agents, including (1) the \ngeneral agent, one who possesses authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name of and \non behalf of the principal; (2) the special agent, one with authority to act only in a specifically designated \ninstance or set of transactions; (3) the agent whose agency is coupled with an interest, one who has a \nproperty interest in addition to authority to act as an agent; (4) the subagent, one appointed by an agent \nwith authority to do so; and (5) the servant (“employee” in modern English), one whose physical conduct \nis subject to control of the principal. \n \nA servant should be distinguished from an independent contractor, whose work is not subject to the \ncontrol of the principal. The difference is important for purposes of taxation, workers’ compensation, and \nliability insurance. \n \nThe agency relationship is usually created by contract, and sometimes governed by the Statute of Frauds, \nbut some agencies are created by operation of law. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n412 \nAn agent owes his principal the highest duty of loyalty, that of a fiduciary. The agent must avoid self-\ndealing, preserve confidential information, perform with skill and care, conduct his personal life so as not \nto bring disrepute on the business for which he acts as agent, keep and render accounts, and give \nappropriate information to the principal. \n \nAlthough the principal is not the agent’s fiduciary, the principal does have certain obligations toward the \nagent—for example, to refrain from interfering with the agent’s work and to indemnify. The employer’s \ncommon-law tort liability toward his employees has been replaced by the workers’ compensation system, \nunder which the employee gives up the right to sue for damages in return for prompt payment of medical \nand job-loss expenses. Injuries must have been work related and the injured person must have been an \nemployee. Courts today allow awards for psychological trauma in the absence of physical injury. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. A woman was involved in an automobile accident that resulted in the death of a passenger in her car. After \nshe was charged with manslaughter, her attorney agreed to work with her insurance company’s claims \nadjuster in handling the case. As a result of the agreement, the woman gave a statement about the \naccident to the claims adjuster. When the prosecuting attorney demanded to see the statement, the \nwoman’s attorney refused on the grounds that the claims adjuster was his—the attorney’s—agent, and \ntherefore the statement was covered by the attorney-client privilege. Is the attorney correct? Why? \n2. A local hotel operated under a franchise agreement with a major hotel chain. Several customers charged \nthe banquet director of the local hotel with misconduct and harassment. They sued the hotel chain (the \nfranchisor) for acts committed by the local hotel (the franchisee), claiming that the franchisee was the \nagent of the franchisor. Is an agency created under these circumstances? Why? \n3. A principal hired a mortgage banking firm to obtain a loan commitment of $10,000,000 from an insurance \ncompany for the construction of a shopping center. The firm was promised a fee of $50,000 for obtaining \nthe commitment. The firm was successful in arranging for the loan, and the insurance company, without \nthe principal’s knowledge, agreed to pay the firm a finder’s fee. The principal then refused to pay the firm \nthe promised $50,000, and the firm brought suit to recover the fee. May the firm recover the fee? Why? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n413 \n4. Based on his experience working for the CIA, a former CIA agent published a book about certain CIA \nactivities in South Vietnam. The CIA did not approve of the publication of the book although, as a condition \nof his employment, the agent had agreed not to publish any information relating to the CIA without specific \napproval of the agency. The government brought suit against the agent, claiming that all the agent’s profits \nfrom publishing the book should go to the government. Assuming that the government suffered only \nnominal damages because the agent published no classified information, will the government prevail? \nWhy? \n5. Upon graduation from college, Edison was hired by a major chemical company. During the time when he \nwas employed by the company, Edison discovered a synthetic oil that could be manufactured at a very low \ncost. What rights, if any, does Edison’s employer have to the discovery? Why? \n6. A US company hired MacDonald to serve as its resident agent in Bolivia. MacDonald entered into a contract \nto sell cars to Bolivia and personally guaranteed performance of the contract as required by Bolivian law. \nThe cars delivered to Bolivia were defective, and Bolivia recovered a judgment of $83,000 from MacDonald. \nMust the US company reimburse MacDonald for this amount?

Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form. The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal. One common form of express authority is the standard \nsignature card on file with banks allowing corporate agents to write checks on the company’s credit. The \nprincipal bears the risk of any wrongful action of his agent, as demonstrated in Allen A. Funt Productions, \nInc. v. Chemical Bank. [1] Allen A. Funt submitted to his bank through his production company various \ncertificates permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts. [2] In fact, for several years \nthe accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in \nhis own account. The company sued its bank, charging it with negligence, apparently for failing to monitor \nthe amount of money taken by the accountant. But the court dismissed the negligence complaint, citing a \nstate statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express \nauthorization given to an agent; in this case, the accountant drew checks on the account within the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n418 \nmonetary limits contained in the signature cards on file with the bank. Letters of introduction and work \norders are other types of express authority. \n \nFigure 10.1 Types of Authority \n \n \nImplied Authority \nNot every detail of an agent’s work can be spelled out. It is impossible to delineate step-by-step the duties \nof a general agent; at best, a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties that the agent is \nto perform. Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a",

If unforeseen circumstances arise and it is \nimpracticable to communicate with the principal to find out what his wishes would be, the agent may do \nwhat is reasonably necessary in order to prevent substantial loss to his principal. During World War II, \nEastern Wine Corporation marketed champagne in a bottle with a diagonal red stripe that infringed the \ntrademark of a French producer. The French company had granted licenses to an American importer to \nmarket its champagne in the United States. The contract between producer and importer required the \nlatter to notify the French company whenever a competitor appeared to be infringing its rights and to \nrecommend steps by which the company could stop the infringement. The authority to institute suit was \nnot expressly conferred, and ordinarily the right to do so would not be inferred. Because France was under \nGerman occupation, however, the importer was unable to communicate with the producer, its principal. \nThe court held that the importer could file suit to enjoin Eastern Wine from continuing to display the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n420 \ninfringing red diagonal stripe, since legal action was “essential to the preservation of the principal’s \nproperty.” [3] \n \nThe rule that a person’s position can carry with it implied authority is fundamental to American business \npractice. But outside the United States this rule is not applicable, and the business executive traveling \nabroad should be aware that in civil-law countries it is customary to present proof of authority to transact \ncorporate business—usually in the form of a power of attorney. This is not always an easy task. Not only \nmust the power of the traveling executive be shown but the right of the corporate officer back in the \nUnited States to delegate authority must also be proven. \n \nApparent Authority \nIn the agency relationship, the agent’s actions in dealing with third parties will affect the legal rights of the \nprincipal. What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion. Estoppel is commonly used to avoid injustice. It \nmay be a substitute for the requirement of consideration in contract (making the promise of a gift \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n421 \nenforceable where the donee has relied upon the promise), and it is sometimes available to circumvent the \nrequirement of a writing under the Statute of Frauds. \n \nApparent authority can arise from prior business transactions.

Understand in what circumstances a principal will be vicariously liable for torts committed by employees. \n2. Recognize the difference between agents whose tort and criminal liability may be imputed to the employer \nand those whose liability will not be so imputed. \n3. Know when the principal will be vicariously liable for intentional torts committed by the agent. \n4. Explain what is meant by “the scope of employment,” within which the agent’s actions may be attributed to \nthe principal and without which they will not. \n5. Name special cases of vicarious liability. \n6. Describe the principal’s liability for crimes committed by the agent. \n \n \n \nPrincipal’s Tort Liability \nThe Distinction between Direct and Vicarious Liability \nWhen is the principal liable for injuries that the agent causes another to suffer? \n \nDirect Liability \nThere is a distinction between torts prompted by the principal himself and torts of which the principal \nwas innocent. If the principal directed the agent to commit a tort or knew that the consequences of the \nagent’s carrying out his instructions would bring harm to someone, the principal is liable. This is an \napplication of the general common-law principle that one cannot escape liability by delegating an \nunlawful act to another. The syndicate that hires a hitman is as culpable of murder as the man who pulls \nthe trigger. Similarly, a principal who is negligent in his use of agents will be held liable for their \nnegligence. This rule comes into play when the principal fails to supervise employees adequately, gives \nfaulty directions, or hires incompetent or unsuitable people for a particular job. Imposing liability on the \nprincipal in these cases is readily justifiable since it is the principal’s own conduct that is the underlying \nfault; the principal here is directly liable. \n \nVicarious Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n424 \nBut the principle of liability for one’s agent is much broader, extending to acts of which the principal had \nno knowledge, that he had no intention to commit nor involvement in, and that he may in fact have \nexpressly prohibited the agent from engaging in. This is the principle of respondeat superior (“let the \nmaster answer”) or the master-servant doctrine, which imposes on the \nprincipal vicarious liability (vicarious means “indirectly, as, by, or through a substitute”) under which \nthe principal is responsible for acts committed by the agent within the scope of the employment \n(see Figure 10.2 \"Principal’s Tort Liability\"). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 10.2 Principal’s Tort Liability \n \n \nThe modern basis for vicarious liability is sometimes termed the “deep pocket” theory: the principal \n(usually a corporation) has deeper pockets than the agent, meaning that it has the wherewithal to pay for \nthe injuries traceable one way or another to events it set in motion. A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\".

We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions \nfall into a category of duties that the law deems nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated \nto provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do so results in liability whether or not the \nharm befell the other because of an independent contractor’s wrongdoing. Thus a homeowner has a duty \nto ensure that physical conditions in and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous. If the owner \nhires an independent contracting firm to dig a sewer line and the contractor negligently fails to guard \npassersby against the danger of falling into an open trench, the homeowner is liable because the duty of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n426 \ncare in this instance cannot be delegated. (The contractor is, of course, liable to the homeowner for any \ndamages paid to an injured passerby.) \n \nLiability for Agent’s Intentional Torts \nIn the nineteenth century, a principal was rarely held liable for intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the \nprincipal did not command the act complained of. The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison. [1] The plaintiff was run over on a highway \nby a speeding cart and horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply.

Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency. Moreover, the principal may revoke the agency or \nthe agent may renounce it; such a revocation or renunciation of agency would be an express \ntermination. Even a contract that states the agreement is irrevocable will not be binding, although it can \nbe the basis for a damage suit against the one who breached the agreement by revoking or renouncing it. \nAs with any contract, a person has the power to breach, even in absence of the right to do so. If the agency \nis coupled with an interest, however, so that the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the \nagent has in the subject matter of the agency, then the principal lacks the power to revoke the agreement. \n \nImplied Termination \nThere are a number of other circumstances that will spell the end of the relationship by implication. \nUnspecified events or changes in business conditions or the value of the subject matter of the agency \nmight lead to a reasonable inference that the agency should be terminated or suspended; for example, the \nprincipal desires the agent to buy silver but the silver market unexpectedly rises and silver doubles in \nprice overnight. Other circumstances that end the agency include disloyalty of the agent (e.g., he accepts \nan appointment that is adverse to his first principal or embezzles from the principal), bankruptcy of the \nagent or of the principal, the outbreak of war (if it is reasonable to infer that the principal, knowing of the \nwar, would not want the agent to continue to exercise authority), and a change in the law that makes a \ncontinued carrying out of the task illegal or seriously interferes with it. \n \n \nBy Operation of Law \nAside from the express termination (by agreement of both or upon the insistence of one), or the necessary \nor reasonable inferences that can be drawn from their agreements, the law voids agencies under certain \ncircumstances. The most frequent termination by operation of law is the death of a principal or an agent. \nThe death of an agent also terminates the authority of subagents he has appointed, unless the principal \nhas expressly consented to the continuing validity of their appointment. Similarly, if the agent or principal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n436 \nloses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, it is suspended or terminated. The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability. Apparent authority in many instances will still exist; this is \ncalled lingering authority. It is imperative for a principal on termination of authority to notify all those \nwho may still be in a position to deal with the agent. The only exceptions to this requirement are when \ntermination is effected by death, loss of the principal’s capacity, or an event that would make it impossible \nto carry out the object of the agency. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the \nscope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks \nauthority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. \nAgencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue. An agency will terminate by operation of law when one",

The court determined that George’s was properly \ndismissed because Pep Line, Carey’s employer, was an independent contractor over which George’s had \nno control.] \n \nThe principal question, therefore, is whether the evidence discloses any other basis upon which a jury \ncould reasonably find Pep Line, the employer of Carey, liable for the assault. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n443 \n \nMichael Carey was in the employment of the defendant Pep Line as a deliveryman. He was authorized to \nmake the delivery of the mattress and springs plaintiff’s sister had bought. He gained access to the \napartment only upon a showing of the delivery receipt for the merchandise. His employment \ncontemplated that he visit and enter that particular apartment. Though the apartment was not owned by \nnor in the control of his employer, it was nevertheless a place he was expected by his employer to enter. \n \nAfter Carey entered, under the credentials of his employment and the delivery receipt, a dispute arose \nnaturally and immediately between him and the plaintiff about two items of great significance in \nconnection with his job. These items were the request of the plaintiff, the customer’s agent, to inspect the \nmattress and springs before payment (which would require their being brought upstairs before the \npayment was made), and Carey’s insistence on getting cash rather than a check. \n \nThe dispute arose out of the very transaction which had brought Carey to the premises, and, according to \nthe plaintiff’s evidence, out of the employer’s instructions to get cash only before delivery. \n \nOn the face of things, Pep Line Trucking Company, Inc. is liable, under two previous decisions of the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. [Citation (1953)] held a taxi owner liable for \ndamages (including a broken leg) sustained by a customer who had been run over by the taxi in pursuit of \na dispute between the driver and the customer about a fare. [Citation (1939)], held a restaurant owner \nliable to a restaurant patron who was beaten with a stick by a restaurant employee, after a disagreement \nover the service. The theory was that: \n \nIt is well established that an employer may be held responsible in tort for assaults committed by \nan employee while he is acting within the scope of his employment, even though he may act \nwantonly and contrary to his employer’s instructions.

[Citations]” \n \nMunick v. City of Durham ([Citation], Supreme Court of North Carolina, 1921), though not a binding \nprecedent, is informative and does show that the theory of liability advanced by the plaintiff is by no \nmeans recent in origin. The plaintiff, Munick, a Russian born Jew, testified that he went to the Durham, \nNorth Carolina city water company office on April 17, 1919, and offered to pay his bill with “three paper \ndollars, one silver dollar, and fifty cents in pennies.” The pennies were in a roll “like the bank fixes them.” \nThe clerk gave a receipt and the plaintiff prepared to leave the office. The office manager came into the \nroom, saw the clerk counting the pennies, became enraged at the situation, shoved the pennies onto the \nfloor and ordered Munick to pick them up. Bolton, the manager, “locked the front door and took me by \nthe jacket and called me ‘God damned Jew,’ and said, ‘I want only bills.’ I did not say anything and he hit \nme in the face. I did not resist, and the door was locked and I could not get out.…” With the door locked, \nBolton then repeatedly choked and beat the plaintiff, finally extracted a bill in place of the pennies, and \nordered him off the premises with injuries including finger marks on his neck that could be seen for eight \nor ten days. Bolton was convicted of unlawful assault [but the case against the water company was \ndismissed]. \n \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court (Clark, C.

A \ndoctrine so fruitful of mischief could not long stand unshaken in an enlightened jurisprudence.’ \nThis court has often held the master liable, even if the agent was willful, provided it was \ncommitted in the course of his employment.

In these \ncircumstances the servant alone is liable for the injury inflicted.” [Citation].…”The general idea is \nthat the employee at the time of doing the wrongful act, in order to fix liability on the employer, \nmust have been acting in behalf of the latter and not on his own account [Citation].” \n \nThe principal physical (as opposed to psychic) damage to the plaintiff is a number of disfiguring knife \nwounds on her head, face, arms, breasts and body. If the instrumentalities of assault had not included \nrape, the case would provoke no particular curiosity nor interest because it comes within all the classic \nrequirements for recovery against the master. The verdict is not attacked as excessive, and could not be \nexcessive in light of the physical injuries inflicted. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n446 \n \nIt may be suggested that [some of the cases discussed] are distinguishable because in each of those cases \nthe plaintiff was a business visitor on the defendant’s “premises.”…Home delivery customers are usually \nin their homes, sometimes alone; and deliveries of merchandise may expose householders to one-on-one \nconfrontations with deliverymen. It would be a strange rule indeed which, while allowing recovery for \nassaults committed in “the store,” would deny a master’s liability for an assault committed on a lone \nwoman in her own home, by a deliveryman required by his job to enter the home.… \n \nIf, as in [one case discussed], the assault was not motivated or triggered off by anything in the \nemployment activity but was the result of only propinquity and lust, there should be no liability. However, \nif the assault, sexual or otherwise, was triggered off or motivated or occasioned by a dispute over the \nconduct then and there of the employer’s business, then the employer should be liable. \n \nIt is, then, a question of fact for the trier of fact, rather than a question of law for the court, whether the \nassault stemmed from purely and solely personal sources or arose out of the conduct of the employer’s \nbusiness; and the trial judge so instructed the jury. \n \nIt follows that, under existing decisions of the District of Columbia Circuit, plaintiff has made out a case \nfor the jury against Pep Line Trucking, Inc. unless the sexual character of one phase of the assault bars her \nfrom recovery for damages from all phases of the assault.",

How can this case and Lyon v. Carey (Section 10.4.2 \"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: \nScope of Employment\") be reconciled? Both involve an agent’s unacceptable behavior—assault—but \nin Lyon the agent’s actions were imputed to the principal, and in Cockrell the agent’s actions were not \nimputed to the principal. \n2. What is the controlling rule of law governing the principal’s liability for the agent’s actions? \n3. The law governing the liability of principals for acts of their agents is well settled. Thus the cases turn on the \nfacts. Who decides what the facts are in a lawsuit? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA contract made by an agent on behalf of the principal legally binds the principal. Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous.",

Describe the creation of an express partnership. \n2. Describe the creation of an implied partnership. \n3. Identify tests of partnership existence. \n4. Understand partnership by estoppel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n464 \n \nCreation of an Express Partnership \nCreation in General \nThe most common way of forming a partnership is expressly—that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a \npartnership is called an express partnership. If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership. Able contributes \n$250,000. Baker contributes the building and space in which the business will operate. Carr contributes \nhis services; he will manage the dealership. \n \nThe first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have a partnership agreement. As should be clear \nfrom the foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the tests of partnership are met. \nHowever, they ought to have an agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among themselves. \n \nThe agreement itself is a contract and should follow the principles and rules spelled out in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" of this book. Because it is intended to govern the relations of the partners toward themselves \nand their business, every partnership contract should set forth clearly the following terms: (1) the name \nunder which the partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3) the nature, scope, and \nlocation of the business; (4) the capital contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to be \ndivided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7) the responsibilities of each partner for \nmanaging the business; (8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm; (9) the method by \nwhich a given partner may withdraw from the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event of a \npartner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs; and (11) method of \ndissolution. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n465 \nSpecific Issues of Concern \nIn forming a partnership, three of these items merit special attention. And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to",

            "chunk": "Creation of Partnership by Estoppel \nOrdinarily, if two people are not legally partners, then third parties cannot so regard them. For example, \nMr. Tot and Mr. Tut own equal shares of a house that they rent but do not regard it as a business and are \nnot in fact partners. They do have a loose “understanding” that since Mr. Tot is mechanically adept, he \nwill make necessary repairs whenever the tenants call. On his way to the house one day to fix its boiler, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n470 \nMr. Tot injures a pedestrian, who sues both Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut. Since they are not partners, the \npedestrian cannot sue them as if they were; hence Mr. Tut has no partnership liability. \n \nSuppose that Mr. Tot and Mr. Tut happened to go to a lumberyard together to purchase materials that Mr. \nTot intended to use to add a room to the house. Short of cash, Mr. Tot looks around and espies Mr. Tat, \nwho greets his two friends heartily by saying within earshot of the salesman who is debating whether to \nextend credit, “Well, how are my two partners this morning?” Messrs. Tot and Tut say nothing but smile \nfaintly at the salesman, who mistakenly but reasonably believes that the two are acknowledging the \npartnership. The salesman knows Mr. Tat well and assumes that since Mr. Tat is rich, extending credit to \nthe “partnership” is a “sure thing.” Messrs. Tot and Tut fail to pay. The lumberyard is entitled to collect \nfrom Mr. Tat, even though he may have forgotten completely about the incident by the time suit is filed. \nUnder Uniform Partnership Act Section 16(1), Mr. Tat would be liable for the debt as being part of \na partnership by estoppel. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect: \n \nSection 308. Liability of Purported Partner. \n \n(a) If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented \nby another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the \npurported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, \nrelying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. \n \nPartnership by estoppel has two elements: (1) a representation to a third party that there is in fact a \npartnership and (2) reliance by the third party on the representation. See Section 11.3.3 \"Partnership by \nEstoppel\", Chavers v. Epsco, Inc., for an example of partnership by estoppel. \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA partnership is any two or more persons—including corporate persons—carrying on a business as co-owners \nfor profit. A primary test of whether a partnership exists is whether there is a sharing of profits, though other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n471 \nfactors such as sharing decision making, sharing liabilities, and how the business is operated are also \nexamined. \nMost partnerships are expressly created. Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is it necessary—or at least useful—to have tests to determine whether a partnership exists? \n2. What elements of the business organization are examined to make this determination? \n3. Jacob rents farmland from Davis and pays Davis a part of the profits from the crop in rent. Is Davis a \npartner? What if Davis offers suggestions on what to plant and when? Now is he a partner? \n4. What elements should be included in a written partnership agreement? \n5. What is an implied partnership? \n6. What is a partnership by estoppel, and why are its “partners” estopped to deny its existence? \n \n  \n \n[1] A joint venture—sometimes known as a joint adventure, coadventure, joint enterprise, joint undertaking, \nsyndicate, group, or pool—is an association of persons to carry on a particular task until completed. In essence, a \njoint venture is a “temporary partnership.” In the United States, the use of joint ventures began with the railroads \nin the late 1800s. Throughout the middle part of the twentieth century joint ventures were common in the \nmanufacturing sector. By the late 1980s, they increasingly appeared in both manufacturing and service industries \nas businesses looked for new, competitive strategies.

Partnership rules generally \napply, although the relationship of the joint venturers is closer to that of special than general agency as discussed \nin Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe. The latter two \nwere based on the Toyota Matrix.

Employment Security Commission \n274 A.2d 707 (Del. 1971) \n \nSTOREY, J. \n \nThe Employment Security Commission, hereinafter referred to as the Commission, levied an involuntary \nassessment against Richard K. Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment.

Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for \nStrazella; 20% for Chaiken and 80% for Spitzer. The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement. Therefore, paragraph five on assignment of partnership interests \ndoes not violate the partnership concept. On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent,",

At about the same time, Whitehead \nlearned that the name “52 Cattle Company” was not registered with the Elko County Clerk. \n \nWhitehead then filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that, pursuant to NRS 602.070, \nLoomis and Shanahan’s failure to register their fictitiously named partnership with the county clerk \nbarred them from bringing a legal action. The district court agreed with Whitehead, granted the motion, \nand dismissed Loomis and Shanahan’s claims. Loomis and Shanahan timely appealed. \n \nDiscussion \nThe district court found that Loomis and Shanahan conducted business under a fictitious name without \nfiling a fictitious name certificate with the Elko County Clerk as required by NRS 602.010. [2] The district \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n478 \ncourt therefore concluded that, pursuant to NRS 602.070, they were barred from bringing an action \nagainst Whitehead because they did not file a fictitious name certificate for the 52 Cattle Company. [3] \n \nLoomis and Shanahan contend that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment \nbecause they did not enter into a contract with Whitehead under the name of the 52 Cattle Company, and \nthey did not conduct business with Whitehead under that name. Loomis and Shanahan argue that NRS \n602.070 is not applicable to their action against Whitehead because they did not mislead Whitehead into \nthinking that he was doing business with anyone other than them. We agree.… \n \nWhen looking at a statute’s language, this court is bound to follow the statute’s plain meaning, unless the \nplain meaning was clearly not intended. Here, in using the phrase “under the assumed or fictitious name,” \nthe statute clearly bars bringing an action when the claims arise from a contract, transaction, or business \nconducted beneath the banner of an unregistered fictitious name. However, NRS 602.070 does not apply \nto individual partners whose transactions or business with another party were not performed under the \nfictitious name. \n \nHere, Whitehead knew that Shanahan entered into the oral contract under his own name. He initially \nthought that Shanahan owned the cattle and Loomis had “some type of interest.” Shanahan did not enter \ninto the contract under the fictitious “52 Cattle Company” name. Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition. Under these circumstances, when there simply was no \nindication that Loomis and Shanahan represented that they were conducting business as the 52 Cattle \nCompany and no reliance by Whitehead that he was doing business with the 52 Cattle Company, NRS \n602.070 does not bar the suit against Whitehead. \n \nWe therefore reverse the district court’s partial summary judgment in this instance and remand for trial \nbecause, while the lawsuit between Loomis and Whitehead involved partnership business, the transaction \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n479 \nat issue was not conducted and the subsequent suit was not maintained under the aegis of the fictitiously \nnamed partnership. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. The purpose of the fictitious name statute might well be, as the court here describes it, “to prevent fraud \nand to give the public information about those entities with which they conduct business.” But that’s not \nwhat the statute says; it says nobody can sue on a cause of action arising out of business conducted under a \nfictitious name if the name is not registered. The legislature determined the consequence of failure to \nregister. Should the court disregard the statute’s plain, unambiguous meaning? \n2. That was one of two arguments by the dissent in this case. The second one was based on this problem: \nShanahan and Loomis agreed that the cattle at issue were partnership cattle bearing the “52” brand. That \nis, the cows were not Shanahan’s; they were the partnership’s. When Whitehead moved to dismiss \nShanahan’s claim—again, because the cows weren’t Shanahan’s—Shanahan conceded that but for the \nexistence of the partnership he would have no claim against Whitehead. If there is no claim against the \ndefendant except insofar as he harmed the partnership business (the cattle), how could the majority assert \nthat claims against Whitehead did not arise out of “the business” conducted under 52 Cattle Company?",

Here is another problem along the same lines but with a different set of facts and a Uniform Partnership \nAct (UPA) jurisdiction (i.e., pre–Revised Uniform Partnership Act [RUPA]). Suppose the plaintiffs had a \npartnership (as they did here), but the claim by one was that the other partner had stolen several head of \ncattle, and UPA was in effect so that the partnership property was owned as “tenant in partnership”—the \ncattle would be owned by the partners as a whole. A person who steals his own property cannot be \ncriminally liable; therefore, a partner cannot be guilty of stealing (or misappropriating) firm property. Thus \nunder UPA there arise anomalous cases, for example, in People v. Zinke, 555 N.E.2d 263 (N.Y. 1990), which \nis a criminal case, Zinke embezzled over a million dollars from his own investment firm but the prosecutor’s \ncase against him was dismissed because, the New York court said, “partners cannot be prosecuted for \nstealing firm property.” If the partnership is a legal entity, as under RUPA, how is this result changed? \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n480 \n \nPartnership by Estoppel \nChavers v. Epsco, Inc. \n98 S.W.3d 421 (Ark. 2003) \n \nHannah, J. \nAppellants Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers appeal a judgment entered against them by the Craighead \nCounty Circuit Court. Reggie and Mark argue that the trial court erred in holding them liable for a \ncompany debt based upon partnership by estoppel because the proof was vague and insufficient and there \nwas no detrimental reliance on the part of a creditor. We hold that the trial court was not clearly \nerroneous in finding liability based upon partnership by estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm. \n \nFacts \nGary Chavers operated Chavers Welding and Construction (“CWC”), a construction and welding business, \nin Jonesboro. Gary’s sons Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers joined their father in the business after \ngraduating from high school. Gary, Mark, and Reggie maintain that CWC was a sole proprietorship owned \nby Gary, and that Reggie and Mark served only as CWC employees, not as CWC partners. \n \nIn February 1999, CWC entered into an agreement with Epsco, Inc. (“Epsco”), a staffing service, to \nprovide payroll and employee services for CWC. Initially, Epsco collected payments for its services on a \nweekly basis, but later, Epsco extended credit to CWC. Melton Clegg, President of Epsco, stated that his \ndecision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was a partnership. \n \nCWC’s account with Epsco became delinquent, and Epsco filed a complaint against Gary, Reggie, and \nMark, individually, and doing business as CWC, to recover payment for the past due account. Gary \ndischarged a portion of his obligation to Epsco due to his filing for bankruptcy. Epsco sought to recover \nCWC’s remaining debt from Reggie and Mark. After a hearing on March 7, 2002, the trial court issued a \nletter opinion, finding that Reggie and Mark “represented themselves to [Epsco] as partners in an existing \npartnership and operated in such a fashion to give creditors in general, and Epsco in particular, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n481 \nimpression that such creditors/potential creditors were doing business with a partnership.…” On May 21, \n2002, the trial court entered an order stating that Reggie and Mark were partners by estoppel as relates to \nEpsco. The trial court found that Reggie and Mark were jointly and severally liable for the debt of CWC in \nthe amount of $80,360.92. In addition, the trial court awarded Epsco pre-judgment interest at the rate of \nsix percent, post-judgment interest at the rate of ten percent, and attorney’s fees in the amount of \n$8,036.92. \n \n[The relevant Arkansas statute provides]: \n \n(1) When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to \nanother representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one (1) or \nmore persons not actual partners, he is liable to any person to whom such representation has \nbeen made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent \npartnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public",

All persons who hold themselves out, or knowingly permit others to hold them out, to the \npublic as partners, although they are not in partnership, become bound as partners to all who \ndeal with them in their apparent relation. \n \nThe liability as a partner of a person who holds himself out as a partner, or permits others to do \nso, is predicated on the doctrine of estoppel and on the policy of the law seeking to prevent frauds \non those who lend their money on the apparent credit of those who are held out as partners. One \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n483 \nholding himself out as a partner or knowingly permitting himself to be so held out is estopped \nfrom denying liability as a partner to one who has extended credit in reliance thereon, although \nno partnership has in fact existed. \n \nIn the present case, the trial court cited specific examples of representations made by Reggie and Mark \nindicating that they were partners of CWC, including correspondence to Epsco, checks written to Epsco, \nbusiness cards distributed to the public, and credit applications.

The fax cover sheet contained the address, telephone \nnumber, and fax number of the business. Listed under this information was “Gary, Reggie, or Mark \nChavers.” Epsco argues that Gary, Reggie, and Mark are all listed on the fax cover sheet, and that this \nindicates that they were holding themselves out to the public as partners of the business. The trial court’s \nfinding that the fax cover sheet indicated that Reggie and Mark were holding themselves out as partners \nof CWC is not clearly erroneous. \n \nThe Epsco Personnel Credit Application \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 9, a personnel credit application, which was received from CWC. \nAdams testified that the exhibit represented a completed credit application that she received from CWC. \nThe type of business checked on the credit application is “partnership.” Adams testified that the \napplication showed the company to be a partnership, and that this information was relied upon in \nextending credit. Clegg testified that he viewed the credit application which indicated that CWC was a \npartnership, and that his decision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was \na partnership. Gary denied filling out the credit application form. \n \nIt was within the trial court’s discretion to find Adams’s and Clegg’s testimony more credible than Gary’s \ntestimony and to determine that Epsco relied on the statement of partnership on the credit application \nbefore extending credit to CWC. The trial court’s finding concerning the credit application is not clearly \nerroneous. \n \n \n \nThe Checks to Epsco \nEpsco argues that Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11, checks written to Epsco showing the \nCWC account to be in the name of “Gary A. or Reggie J. Chavers,” indicates that Reggie was holding \nhimself out to be a partner of CWC. Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 was signed by Gary, and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11 \nwas signed by Reggie. The checks are evidence that Reggie was holding himself out to the public as a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n485 \npartner of CWC, and Epsco could have detrimentally relied on the checks before extending credit to CWC. \nThe trial court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the checks supported a finding of partnership by \nestoppel. \n \nThe Business Card \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 4, a business card that states “Chavers Welding, Construction & \nCrane Service.” Listed on the card as “owners” are Gary Chavers and Reggie Chavers. Gary testified that \nthe business cards were printed incorrectly, and that Reggie’s name should not have been included as an \nowner. He also testified that some of the cards might have been handed out, and that it was possible that \nhe might have given one of the cards to a business listed as one of CWC’s credit references on Plaintiff’s \nExhibit # 1. \n \nThe business card listing Reggie as an owner indicates that Reggie was holding himself out as a partner. \nAs we stated in [Citation] when a person holds himself out as a member of partnership, any one dealing \nwith the firm on the faith of such representation is entitled to assume the relation continues until notice of \nsome kind is given of its discontinuance. There is no indication that Reggie ever informed any person who \nreceived a business card that the business relationship listed on the card was incorrect or had been \ndiscontinued.

If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the \nterm fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply. \n \nDuties Partners Owe Each Other \nAmong the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of \nloyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty \nto account to the partnership. These are all very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as \npartnership law is based on agency concepts. [2] \n \nDuty to Serve \nUnless otherwise agreed, expressly or impliedly, a partner is expected to work for the firm. The \npartnership, after all, is a profit-making co-venture, and it would not do for one to loaf about and still \nexpect to get paid. For example, suppose Joan takes her two-week vacation from the horse-stable \npartnership she operates with Sarah and Sandra. Then she does not return for four months because she \nhas gone horseback riding in the Southwest. She might end up having to pay if the partnership hired a \nsubstitute to do her work. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n493 \nIn general, this requires partners to put the firm’s interests ahead of their own. Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership. \n \nLimits on the Reach of the Fiduciary Duty \nThis sets out a fairly limited scope for application of the fiduciary standard, which is reasonable because \npartners do not delegate open-ended control to their copartners. Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached.",

Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”? Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404. [8] \n \nThe Rights That Partners Have in a Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n496 \nNecessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of",

The liability is a loan owing to the \npartner by the firm. \nRight to Return of Capital Contribution \nWhen a partner joins a partnership, she is expected to make a capital contribution to the firm; this may be \ndeducted from her share of the distributed profit and banked by the firm in its capital account. The law \nprovides that “the partnership must reimburse a partner for an advance of funds beyond the amount of \nthe partner’s agreed capital contribution, thereby treating the advance as a loan.” [10] A partner may get a \nreturn of capital under UPA after creditors are paid off if the business is wound down and terminated. [11] \n \nRight to Compensation \nSection 401(d) of RUPA provides that “a partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for \nthe partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of \nthe partnership”; UPA Section 18(f) is to the same effect. A partner gets his money from the firm by \nsharing the profits, not by a salary or wages. \n \nRight to Management \nAll partners are entitled to share equally in the management and conduct of the business, unless the \npartnership agreement provides otherwise. [12] The partnership agreement could be structured to delegate \nmore decision-making power to one class of partners (senior partners) than to others (junior partners), or \nit may give more voting weight to certain individuals. For example, perhaps those with the most \nexperience will, for the first four years after a new partner is admitted, have more voting weight than the \nnew partner. \n \nRight to Choose Partners \nA business partnership is often analogized to a marriage partnership. In both there is a relationship of \ntrust and confidence between (or among) the parties; in both the poor judgment, negligence, or \ndishonesty of one can create liabilities on the other(s). In a good marriage or good partnership, the \npartners are friends, whatever else the legal relationship imposes. Thus no one is compelled to accept a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n498 \npartner against his or her will. Section 401(i) of RUPA provides, “A person may become a partner only \nwith the consent of all of the partners.” UPA Section 18(g) is to the same effect; the doctrine is called \ndelectus personae. The freedom to select new partners, however, is not absolute. In 1984, the Supreme \nCourt held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964—which prohibits discrimination in employment \nbased on race, religion, national origin, or sex—applies to partnerships. [13] \n \nRight to Property of the Partnership \nPartners are the owners of the partnership, which might not include any physical property; that is, one \npartner could contribute the building, furnishings, and equipment and rent those to the partnership (or \nthose could count as her partnership capital contribution and become the partnership’s). But partnership \nproperty consists of all property originally advanced or contributed to the partnership or subsequently \nacquired by purchase or contribution. Unless a contrary intention can be shown, property acquired with \npartnership funds is partnership property, not an individual partner’s: “Property acquired by a \npartnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners individually.” [14] \n \nRights in Specific Partnership Property: UPA Approach \nSuppose that Able, who contributed the building and grounds on which the partnership business is \nconducted, suddenly dies. Who is entitled to her share of the specific property, such as inventory, the \nbuilding, and the money in the cash register—her husband and children, or the other partners, Baker and \nCarr?

Section 25(1) of UPA declares that the partners hold the partnership property \nas tenants in partnership.

But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499 \nSection 501 of RUPA provides, “A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in \npartnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.” Partnership property \nis owned by the entity; UPA’s concept of tenants in partnership is abolished in favor of adoption of the \nentity theory. The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and \nright to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.” [17] \n \nThis transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, \nSection 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty?

Every partner is an agent of the \npartnership for the purpose of its business. Consequently, the following discussion will be a review of \nagency law, covered in Chapter 11 \"Partnerships: General Characteristics and Formation\" as it applies to \npartnerships. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) adds a few new wrinkles to the liability issue. \n \nContract Liability \nLiability of the Partnership \nRecall that an agent can make contracts on behalf of a principal under three types of authority: express, \nimplied, and apparent. Express authority is that explicitly delegated to the agent, implied authority is \nthat necessary to the carrying out of the express authority, and apparent authority is that which a third \nparty is led to believe has been conferred by the principal on the agent, even though in fact it was not or it \nwas revoked. When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others. [2] Section 401(j) of RUPA requires the unanimous consent of the partners for a \ngrant of authority outside the ordinary course of business, unless the partnership agreement provides \notherwise. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n506 \nUnder the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) Section 9(3), the firm is not liable for five actions that no single \npartner has implied or apparent authority to do, because they are not “in the ordinary course of \npartnership.” These actions are: (1) assignment of partnership property for the benefit of creditors, (2) \ndisposing of the firm’s goodwill (selling the right to do business with the firm’s clients to another \nbusiness), (3) actions that make it impossible to carry on the business, (4) confessing a judgment against \nthe partnership, and (5) submitting a partnership claim or liability. RUPA omits that section, leaving it to \nthe courts to decide the outer limits of the agency power of a partner. In any event, unauthorized actions \nby a partner may be ratified by the partnership. \n \nPartnership “Statements” \nNew under RUPA is the ability of partnerships, partners, or even nonpartners to issue and file \n“statements” that announce to the world the establishment or denial of authority. The goal here is to \ncontrol the reach of apparent authority. There are several kinds of statements authorized. \n \nA statement of partnership authority is allowed by RUPA Section 303. It specifies the names of the \npartners authorized, or not authorized, to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership and any \nother matters. The most important goal of the statement of authority is to facilitate the transfer of real \nproperty held in the name of the partnership. A statement must specify the names of the partners \nauthorized to execute an instrument transferring that property. \nA statement of denial, RUPA Section 304, operates to allow partners (and persons named as partners) \nan opportunity to deny any fact asserted in a statement of partnership authority. \n \nA statement of dissociation, RUPA Section 704, may be filed by a partnership or a dissociated partner, \ninforming the world that the person is no longer a partner. This tells the world that the named person is \nno longer in the partnership. \n \nThere are three other statements authorized: a statement of qualification establishes that the partnership \nhas satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability \npartnership; a statement of foreign qualification means a limited liability partnership is qualified and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n507 \nregistered to do business in a state other than that in which it is originally registered; and a statement of \namendment or cancellation of any of the foregoing.

[3] Limited liability partnerships are taken up \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nGenerally, RUPA Section 105 allows partnerships to file these statements with the state secretary of state’s \noffice; those affecting real estate need to be filed with (or also with) the local county land recorder’s office. \nThe notices bind those who know about them right away, and they are constructive notice to the world \nafter ninety days as to authority to transfer real property in the partnership’s name, as to dissociation, and \nas to dissolution. However, as to other grants or limitations of authority, “only a third party who knows or \nhas received a notification of a partner’s lack of authority in an ordinary course transaction is bound.” [4] \n \nSince RUPA is mostly intended to provide the rules for the small, unsophisticated partnership, it is \nquestionable whether these arcane “statements” are very often employed. \n \nPersonal Liability of Partners, in General \nIt is clear that the partnership is liable for contracts by authorized partners, as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs. The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner. Thus under RUPA the partners \nare guarantors of the partnership’s liabilities. [6] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n508 \nUnder UPA, contract liability is joint only, not also several. This means the partners must be sued in a \njoint action brought against them all. A partner who is not named cannot later be sued by a creditor in a \nseparate proceeding, though the ones who were named could see a proportionate contribution from the \nones who were not. \n \nLiability of Incoming Partners \nUnder RUPA Section 306(b), a new partner has no personal liability to existing creditors of the \npartnership, and only her capital investment in the firm is at risk for the satisfaction of existing \npartnership debts. Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners. Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action. Each and every partner is separately liable for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n509",

Understand the dissolution of general partnerships under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). \n2. Understand the dissociation and dissolution of general partnerships under the Revised Uniform Partnership \nAct (RUPA). \n3. Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it. All the partners may decide that it is preferable to dissolve rather than to \ncontinue. One of the partners may have been expelled in accordance with a provision in the agreement. In \nnone of these circumstances is the agreement violated, though its spirit surely might have been. Professor \nSamuelson calls to mind the example of William Dean Howells’s Silas Lapham, who forces his partner to \nsell out by offering him an ultimatum: “You may buy me out or I’ll buy you out.” The ultimatum was given \nat a time when the partner could not afford to buy Lapham out, so the partner had no choice. \n \nIn Violation of the Agreement \nDissolution may also result from violation of the agreement, as when the partners decide to discharge a \npartner though no provision permits them to do so, or as when a partner decides to quit in violation of a \nterm agreement. In the former case, the remaining partners are liable for damages for wrongful \ndissolution, and in the latter case, the withdrawing partner is liable to the remaining partners the same \nway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n513 \n \nBy Operation of Law \nA third reason for dissolution is the occurrence of some event, such as enactment of a statute, that makes \nit unlawful to continue the business. Or a partner may die or one or more partners or the entire \npartnership may become bankrupt. Dissolution under these circumstances is said to be by operation of \nlaw. [3] \n \nBy Court Order \nFinally, dissolution may be by court order. Courts are empowered to dissolve partnerships when “on \napplication by or for a partner” a partner is shown to be a lunatic, of unsound mind, incapable of \nperforming his part of the agreement, “guilty of such conduct as tends to affect prejudicially the carrying \non of the business,” or otherwise behaves in such a way that “it is not reasonably practicable to carry on \nthe business in partnership with him.” A court may also order dissolution if the business can only be \ncarried on at a loss or whenever equitable. In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions",

According to the comment, RUPA \ndramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, \n“dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by \na partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a \ndifferent meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation \nDissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s \nwithdrawal from the firm’s business. \n \nCauses of Dissociation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n517 \nDissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers \ndissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a \npartner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, \nbecause that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security \npurposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; \n(5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been \ndetermined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, \nacts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) \nthe partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner \nis a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the \npartnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or \na corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated. [11] \n \nEffect of Dissociation \nAfter a partner dissociates, the partner’s right to participate in management terminates. (However, if the \ndissociation goes on to dissolution and winding up, partners who have not wrongfully caused the \ndissociation may participate in winding-up activities.) [12] The dissociated partner’s duty of loyalty and \ncare terminates; the former partner may compete with the firm, except for matters arising before the \ndissociation. [13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have",

[13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have \nconstructive notice from a filed “statement of dissociation.”[14] The dissociated partner, of course, is liable \nfor damages to the partnership if third parties had cause to think she was still a partner and the \npartnership became liable because of that; she is liable to the firm as an unauthorized agent.[15] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n518 \n \nA partner’s dissociation does nothing to change that partner’s liability for predissociation \nobligations. [16] For postdissociation liability, exposure is for two years if at the time of entering into the \ntransaction the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) didn’t have \nnotice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have constructive notice from a filed “statement of \ndissociation.” For example, Baker withdraws from the firm of Able, Baker, and Carr. Able contracts with \nHydroLift for a new hydraulic car lift that costs $25,000 installed. HydroLift is not aware at the time of \ncontracting that Baker is disassociated and believes she is still a partner. A year later, the firm not having \nbeen paid, HydroLift sues Able, Baker, and Carr and the partnership. Baker has potential liability. Baker \ncould have protected herself by filing a “statement of dissociation,” or—better—the partnership agreement \nshould provide that the firm would file such statements upon the dissociation of any partner (and if it \ndoes not, it would be liable to her for the consequences). \n \nDissolution \nDissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution (see the discussion later in this section of how the firm \ncontinues after a dissociation); dissolution and winding up happen only for the causes stated in RUPA \nSection 801, discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nThere are three causes of dissolution: (1) by act of the partners—some dissociations do trigger dissolution; \n(2) by operation of law; or (3) by court order. The partnership agreement may change or eliminate the \ndissolution trigger as to (1); dissolution by the latter two means cannot be tinkered with.[17] \n \n(1) Dissolution by act of the partners may occur as follows: \n \n• \nAny member of an at-will partnership can dissociate at any time, triggering dissolution and \nliquidation. The partners who wish to continue the business of a term partnership, though, cannot \nbe forced to liquidate the business by a partner who withdraws prematurely in violation of the \npartnership agreement. In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable. For example, if",

For example, if \nCreditor gets a charging order against Paul Partner and the obligation cannot reasonably be paid by the \nfirm, a court could order dissolution so Creditor would get paid from the liquidated assets of the firm. \n \nEffect of Dissolution \nA partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership \nis terminated when the winding up of its business is completed. [19] However, before winding up is \ncompleted, the partners—except any wrongfully dissociating—may agree to carry on the partnership, in \nwhich case it resumes business as if dissolution never happened. [20] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n520 \n \nContinuing after Dissociation \nDissociation, again, does not necessarily cause dissolution. In an at-will partnership, the death (including \ntermination of an entity partner), bankruptcy, incapacity, or expulsion of a partner will not cause \ndissolution. [21] In a term partnership, the firm continues if, within ninety days of an event triggering \ndissociation, fewer than half the partners express their will to wind up. The partnership agreement may \nprovide that RUPA’s dissolution-triggering events, including dissociation, will not trigger dissolution. \nHowever, the agreement cannot change the rules that dissolution is caused by the business becoming \nillegal or by court order. Creditors of the partnership remain as before, and the dissociated partner is \nliable for partnership obligations arising before dissociation. \n \nSection 701 of RUPA provides that if the firm continues in business after a partner dissociates, without \nwinding up, then the partnership must purchase the dissociated partner’s interest; RUPA Section 701(b) \nexplains how to determine the buyout price. It is the amount that would have been distributed to the \ndissociated partner if, on the date of dissociation, the firm’s assets were sold “at a price equal to the \ngreater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern,” \nminus damages for wrongful dissociation. A wrongful dissociater may have to wait a while to get paid in \nfull, unless a court determines that immediate payment “will not cause an undue hardship to the \npartnership,” but the longest nonwrongful dissociaters need to wait is 120 days. [22] A dissociated partner \ncan sue the firm to determine the buyout price and the court may assess attorney’s, appraiser’s, and \nexpert’s fees against a party the court finds “acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or in bad faith.”[23] \n \nWinding Up the Partnership under UPA and RUPA \nIf the partners decide not to continue the business upon dissolution, they are obliged to wind up the \nbusiness. The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated. [24]Winding up entails concluding all unfinished business pending at the \ndate of dissolution and payment of all debts. The partners must then settle accounts among themselves in \norder to distribute the remaining assets. At any time after dissolution and before winding up is completed, \nthe partners (except a wrongfully dissociated one) can stop the process and carry on the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n521 \n \nUPA and RUPA are not significantly different as to winding up, so they will be discussed together. Two \nissues are discussed here: who can participate in winding up and how the assets of the firm are distributed \non liquidation. \n \nWho Can Participate in Winding Up \nThe partners who have not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership \nbusiness. On application of any partner, a court may for good cause judicially supervise the winding up. [25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and",

However, RUPA eliminates the distinction between capital and profits when the firm pays \npartners what is owed to them; RUPA Section 807(b) speaks simply of the right of a partner to a \nliquidating distribution. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.3 Priority Partnership Liabilities under RUPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n522 \n \n \nPartners are entitled to share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including \nthose owed to partners, are paid off, although the partnership agreement can state a different share—for \nexample, in proportion to capital contribution. If after winding up there is a net loss, whether capital or \notherwise, each partner must contribute toward it in accordance with his share in the profits, had there \nbeen any, unless the agreement states otherwise. If any of the partners is insolvent or refuses to contribute \nand cannot be sued, the others must contribute their own share to pay off the liabilities and in addition \nmust contribute, in proportion to their share of the profits, the additional amount necessary to pay the \nliabilities of their defaulting partners. \n \nIn the event of insolvency, a court may take possession of both partnership property and individual assets \nof the partners; this again is a big disadvantage to the partnership form. \n \nThe estate of a deceased partner is credited or liable as that partner would have been if she were living at \nthe time of the distribution. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder UPA, the withdrawal of any partner from the partnership causes dissolution; the withdrawal may be \ncaused in accordance with the agreement, in violation of the agreement, by operation of law, or by court \norder. Dissolution terminates the partners’ authority to act for the partnership, except for winding up, but \nremaining partners may decide to carry on as a new partnership or may decide to terminate the firm. If they \ncontinue, the old creditors remain as creditors of the new firm, the former partner remains liable for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n523 \nobligations incurred while she was a partner (she may be liable for debts arising after she left, unless proper \nnotice is given to creditors), and the former partner or her estate is entitled to an accounting and payment for \nthe partnership interest. If the partners move to terminate the firm, winding up begins. \nUnder RUPA, a partner who ceases to be involved in the business is dissociated, but dissociation does not \nnecessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation happens when a partner quits, voluntarily or involuntarily; when a \npartner dies or becomes incompetent; or on request by the firm or a partner upon court order for a partner’s \nwrongful conduct, among other reasons. The dissociated partner loses actual authority to bind the firm but \nremains liable for predissociation obligations and may have lingering authority or lingering liability for two \nyears provided the other party thought the dissociated one was still a partner; a notice of dissociation will, \nafter ninety days, be good against the world as to dissociation and dissolution. If the firm proceeds to \ntermination (though partners can stop the process before its end), the next step is dissolution, which occurs \nby acts of partners, by operation of law, or by court order upon application by a partner if continuing the \nbusiness has become untenable. After dissolution, the only business undertaken is to wind up affairs. \nHowever, the firm may continue after dissociation; it must buy out the dissociated one’s interest, minus \ndamages if the dissociation was wrongful. \nIf the firm is to be terminated, winding up entails finishing the business at hand, paying off creditors, and \nsplitting the remaining surplus or liabilities according the parties’ agreement or, absent any, according to the \nrelevant act (UPA or RUPA). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Conway \n391 N.W. 2d 419 (Mich. App. 1986) \n \nPETERSON, J. \n \nDefendant cheated his partner and appeals from the trial court’s judgment granting that partner a \nremedy. \n \nPlaintiff was an established commercial photographer in Kalamazoo who also had a partnership interest \nin another photography business, Colonial Studios, in Coldwater. In 1974, defendant became plaintiff’s \npartner in Colonial Studios, the name of which was changed to Skylight Studios. Under the partnership \nagreement, defendant was to be the operating manager of the partnership, in return for which he would \nhave a guaranteed draw. Except for the guaranteed draw, the partnership was equal in ownership and the \nsharing of profits. \nPrior to defendant’s becoming a partner, the business had acquired a small contractual clientele of schools \nfor which the business provided student portrait photographs. The partners agreed to concentrate on this \ntype of business, and both partners solicited schools with success. Gross sales, which were $40,000 in \n1974, increased every year and amounted to $209,085 in 1980 [about $537,000 in 2011 dollars]. \n \nIn the spring of 1981, defendant offered to buy out plaintiff and some negotiations followed. On June 25, \n1981, however, plaintiff was notified by the defendant that the partnership was dissolved as of July 1, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n526 \n1981. Plaintiff discovered that defendant: had closed up the partnership’s place of business and opened up \nhis own business; had purchased equipment and supplies in preparation for commencing his own \nbusiness and charged them to the partnership; and had taken with him the partnership employees and \nmost of its equipment. \n \nDefendant had also stolen the partnership’s business. He had personally taken over the business of some \ncustomers by telling them that the partnership was being dissolved; in other cases he simply took over \npartnership contracts without telling the customers that he was then operating on his own. Plaintiff also \nlearned that defendant’s deceit had included the withdrawal, without plaintiff’s knowledge, of partnership \nfunds for defendant’s personal use in 1978 in an amount exceeding $11,000 [about $36,000 in 2011 \ndollars]. \n \nThe trial judge characterized the case as a “classic study of greed” and found that defendant had in effect \nappropriated the business enterprise, holding that defendant had “knowingly and willfully violated his \nfiduciary relationship as a partner by converting partnership assets to his use and, in doing so, literally \ndestroying the partnership.” He also found that the partnership could have been sold as a going business \non June 30, 1981, and that after a full accounting, it had a value on that date of $94,596 less accounts",

The court characterizes the defendant as having “cheated his partner”—that is, Conway committed \nfraud. (Gilroy said his business had been “stolen.”) Fraud is a tort. Punitive damages may be awarded \nagainst a tortfeasor, even in a jurisdiction that generally disallows punitive damages in contract. In fact, \npunitive damages are sometimes awarded for breach of the partnership fiduciary duty. In Cadwalader, \nWickersham & Taft v. Beasley, 728 So.2d 253 (Florida Ct. App., 1998), a New York law firm was found \nto have wrongfully expelled a partner lawyer, Beasley, from membership in its Palm Beach, Florida, \noffices. New York law controlled. The trial court awarded Beasley $500,000 in punitive damages. The \nappeals court, construing the same UPA as the court construed in Gilroy, said: \nUnder New York law, the nature of the conduct which justifies an award of punitive damages is \nconduct having a high degree of moral culpability, or, in other words, conduct which shows a \n“conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such \ndisregard.”…[S]ince the purpose of punitive damages is to both punish the wrongdoer and deter others \nfrom such wrongful behavior, as a matter of policy, courts have the discretion to award punitive \ndamages[.]…[The defendant] was participating in a clandestine plan to wrongfully expel some \npartners for the financial gain of other partners. Such activity cannot be said to be honorable, much \nless to comport with the “punctilio of an honor.” Because these findings establish that [the defendant] \nconsciously disregarded the rights of Beasley, we affirm the award of punitive damages. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n529 \n \nAs a matter of social policy, which is the better ruling, the Michigan court’s in Gilroy or the Florida court’s \nin Cadwalader? \n \n \nPartnership Authority, Express or Apparent \nHodge v Garrett \n614 P.2d 420 (Idaho 1980) \n \nBistline, J. \n \n[Plaintiff] Hodge and defendant-appellant Rex E.

(The trial court \nfound that Hodge and Voeller had orally agreed that this 20 foot strip would be encumbered by an \neasement for ingress and egress to the partnership lands.) \n \nVoeller testified that he had told Hodge prior to signing that Hodge would have to present him with a plat \nplan which would have to be approved by the partners before the property could be sold. Hodge denied \nthat a plat plan had ever been mentioned to him, and he testified that Voeller did not tell him that the \napproval of the other partners was needed until after the contract was signed. Hodge also testified that he \noffered to pay Voeller the full purchase price when he signed the contract, but Voeller told him that that \nwas not necessary. \n \nThe trial court found that Voeller had actual and apparent authority to execute the contract on behalf of \nthe partnership, and that the contract should be specifically enforced.

But the partnership may recover the property (except from a bona fide purchaser from \nthe grantee) if it can show (A) that the conveying partner was not apparently carrying on \nbusiness in the usual way or (B) that he had in fact no authority and the grantee had knowledge \nof that fact. The burden of proof with respect to authority is thus on the partnership.” [Citation] \n \nThus this contract is enforceable if Voeller had the actual authority to sell the property, or, even if Voeller \ndid not have such authority, the contract is still enforceable if the sale was in the usual way of carrying on \nthe business and Hodge did not know that Voeller did not have this authority.",

Punitive damages may be awarded against a tortfeasor, even in a jurisdiction that generally disallows punitive damages in contract. In fact, punitive damages are sometimes awarded for breach of the partnership fiduciary duty. In Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft v. Beasley, 728 So.2d 253 (Florida Ct. App., 1998), a New York law firm was found to have wrongfully expelled a partner lawyer, Beasley, from membership in its Palm Beach, Florida, offices. New York law controlled. The trial court awarded Beasley $500,000 in punitive damages. The appeals court, construing the same UPA as the court construed in Gilroy, said: Under New York law, the nature of the conduct which justifies an award of punitive damages is conduct having a high degree of moral culpability, or, in other words, conduct which shows a “conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such disregard.”…[S]ince the purpose of punitive damages is to both punish the wrongdoer and deter others from such wrongful behavior, as a matter of policy, courts have the discretion to award punitive damages[.]…[The defendant] was participating in a clandestine plan to wrongfully expel some partners for the financial gain of other partners. Such activity cannot be said to be honorable, much less to comport with the “punctilio of an honor.” Because these findings establish that [the defendant] consciously disregarded the rights of Beasley, we affirm the award of punitive damages. As a matter of social policy, which is the better ruling, the Michigan court’s in Gilroy or the Florida court’s in Cadwalader?",

Here the evidence \nshowed, and the trial court found: \n \n1. “That the defendant, Rex E. Voeller, was one of the original partners of the Pay-Ont Drive In Theatre; \nthat the other defendants obtained their partnership interest by inheritance upon the death of other \noriginal partners; that upon the death of a partner the partnership affairs were not wound up, but \ninstead, the partnership merely continued as before, with the heirs of the deceased partner owning \ntheir proportionate share of the partnership interest. \n2. “That at the inception of the partnership, and at all times thereafter, Rex E. Voeller was the exclusive, \nmanaging partner of the partnership and had the full authority to make all decisions pertaining to the \npartnership affairs, including paying the bills, preparing profit and loss statements, income tax \nreturns and the ordering of any goods or services necessary to the operation of the business.” \n \nThe court made no finding that it was customary for Voeller to sell real property, or even personal \nproperty, belonging to the partnership. Nor was there any evidence to this effect. Nor did the court discuss \nwhether it was in the usual course of business for the managing partner of a theater to sell real property. \nYet the trial court found that Voeller had apparent authority to sell the property. From this it must be \ninferred that the trial court believed it to be in the usual course of business for a partner who has exclusive \ncontrol of the partnership business to sell real property belonging to the partnership, where that property \nis not being used in the partnership business. We cannot agree with this conclusion. For a theater, \n“carrying on in the usual way the business of the partnership,” [Citation to relevant section of the statute] \nmeans running the operations of the theater; it does not mean selling a parcel of property adjacent to the \ntheater. Here the contract of sale stated that the land belonged to the partnership, and, even if Hodge \nbelieved that Voeller as the exclusive manager had authority to transact all business for the firm, Voeller \nstill could not bind the partnership through a unilateral act which was not in the usual business of the \npartnership.

To that end, Southern Oaks and Horizon entered \ninto several partnership and management contracts in 1993. \n \nIn 1996, Southern Oaks filed suit alleging numerous defaults and breaches of the twenty-year \nagreements.…[T]he trial court found largely in favor of Southern Oaks, concluding that Horizon breached \nits obligations under two different partnership agreements [and that] Horizon had breached several \nmanagement contracts. Thereafter, the court ordered that the partnerships be dissolved, finding that “the \nparties to the various agreements which are the subject of this lawsuit are now incapable of continuing to \noperate in business together” and that because it was dissolving the partnerships, “there is no entitlement \nto future damages.…” In its cross appeal, Southern Oaks asserts that because Horizon unilaterally and \nwrongfully sought dissolution of the partnerships, Southern Oaks should receive a damage award for the \nloss of the partnerships’ seventeen remaining years’ worth of future profits. We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit. First, the trial court’s finding that the parties are \nincapable of continuing to operate in business together is a finding of “irreconcilable differences,” a \npermissible reason for dissolving the partnerships under the express terms of the partnership agreements. \nThus, dissolution was not “wrongful,” assuming there can be “wrongful” dissolutions, and Southern Oaks \nwas not entitled to damages for lost future profits. Additionally, the partnership contracts also permit \ndissolution by “judicial decree.” Although neither party cites this provision, it appears that pursuant \nthereto, the parties agreed that dissolution would be proper if done by a trial court for whatever reason \nthe court found sufficient to warrant dissolution. \n \nSecond, even assuming the partnership was dissolved for a reason not provided for in the partnership \nagreements, damages were properly denied. Under RUPA, it is clear that wrongful dissociation triggers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n540 \nliability for lost future profits. See [RUPA:] “A partner who wrongfully dissociates is liable to the \npartnership and to the other partners for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition \nto any other obligation of the partner to the partnership or to the other partners.” However, RUPA \ndoes not contain a similar provision for dissolution; RUPA does not refer to the dissolutions as rightful or \nwrongful. [RUPA sets out] “Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business,” [and] \noutlines the events causing dissolution without any provision for liability for damages.…[RUPA] \nrecognizes judicial dissolution: \n \nA partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of \nthe following events:… \n \n(5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that: \n(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; \n(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it \nnot reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with such partner; or",

Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy, \nversus the “moral hazard” of allowing them to emerge mostly unscathed from their own harmful or \nfoolish activities, thus externalizing resulting losses upon others. Some people feel that during the \nrun-up to the “Great Recession” of 2007–09, the economic system allowed too much risk taking. \nWhen the risky investments collapsed, though, instead of forcing the risk takers to suffer loss, the \ngovernment intervened—it “bailed them out,” as they say, putting the consequences of the failed \nrisks on the taxpayer. \n \nThe risk-averseness and inventiveness of businesspeople is seemingly unlimited, as is investors’ urge \nto make profits through others’ efforts with as little risk as possible. The rationale for the invention of \nthese hybrid business forms, then, is (1) risk reduction and (2) tax reduction. Here we take up the \nmost common hybrid types first: limited partnerships and limited liability companies. Then we cover \nthem in the approximate chronological order of their invention: sub-S corporations, limited liability \npartnerships, and limited liability limited partnerships. All these forms are entities. \n \n \n \n13.1 Limited Partnerships \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n548 \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nUnderstand the following aspects of the limited partnership: \n1. Governing law and definition \n2. Creation and capitalization \n3. Control and compensation \n4. Liabilities \n5. Taxation \n6. Termination \n \n \nGoverning Law and Definition \nThe limited partnership is attractive because of its treatment of taxation and its imposition of limited \nliability on its limited partners. \nGoverning Law \nThe original source of limited partnership law is the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which was \ndrafted in 1916. A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted \nby the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and \nin 2001. \n \nThe 2001 act was \ndrafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can \nmeet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships. This Act therefore targets two \ntypes of enterprises that seem largely beyond the scope of LLPs and LLCs: (i) sophisticated, \nmanager-entrenched commercial deals whose participants commit for the long term, and (ii) \nestate planning arrangements (family limited partnerships). The Act accordingly assumes that, \nmore often than not, people utilizing it will want (1) strong centralized management, strongly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n549 \nentrenched, and (2) passive investors with little control over or right to exit the entity. The Act’s \nrules, and particularly its default rules, have been designed to reflect these assumptions. [1] \n \nAll states except Louisiana adopted the 1976 or 1985 act—most opting for the 1985 version—and sixteen \nstates have adopted the 2001 version. The acts may be properly referred to with a hyphen: “ULPA-1985,” \nor “ULPA-2001”; the word revised has been dropped. Here, we mainly discuss ULPA-1985. The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) also applies to limited \npartnerships except where it is inconsistent with the limited partnership statutes. The ULPA-2001 is not \nso much related to UPA or RUPA as previous versions were. \n \nDefinition \nA limited partnership (LP) is defined as “a partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws \nof a State and having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.” [2] The form tends \nto be attractive in business situations that focus on a single or limited-term project, such as making a \nmovie or developing real estate; it is also widely used by private equity firms. \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nUnlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created in accordance with the state statute \nauthorizing it. There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation",

There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation \nThe act requires that the firm’s promoters file a certificate of limited partnership with the secretary \nof state; if they do not, or if the certificate is substantially defective, a general partnership is created. The \ncertificate must be signed by all general partners. It must include the name of the limited partnership \n(which must include the words limited partnership so the world knows there are owners of the firm who \nare not liable beyond their contribution) and the names and business addresses of the general partners. If \nthere are any changes in the general partners, the certificate must be amended. The general partner may \nbe, and often is, a corporation. Having a general partner be a corporation achieves the goal of limited \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n550 \nliability for everyone, but it is somewhat of a “clunky” arrangement.

Here is an example of \na limited partnership operating \nagreement:http://www.wyopa.com/Articles%20of%20limited%20partnership.htm. \n \nAny natural person, partnership, limited partnership (domestic or foreign), trust, estate, association, or \ncorporation may become a partner of a limited partnership. \n \nCapitalization \nThe money to capitalize the business typically comes mostly from the limited partners, who may \nthemselves be partnerships or corporations. That is, the limited partners use the business as an \ninvestment device: they hope the managers of the firm (the general partners) will take their contributions \nand give them a positive return on it. The contributions may be money, services, or property, or promises \nto make such contributions in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nControl is not generally shared by both classes of partners. \n \nGeneral Partners \nThe control of the limited partnership is in the hands of the general partners, which may—as noted—be \npartnerships or corporations. \n \nLimited Partners \nUnder ULPA-1985 and its predecessors, a limited partner who exercised any significant control would \nincur liability like a general partner as to third parties who believed she was one (the “control rule”). \nHowever, among the things a limited partner could do that would not risk the loss of insulation from \npersonal liability were these “safe harbors”: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n551 \n• \nActing as an agent, employee, or contractor for the firm; or being an officer, director, or \nshareholder of a corporate general partner \n• \nConsulting with the general partner of the firm \n• \nRequesting or attending a meeting of partners \n• \nBeing a surety for the firm \n• \nVoting on amendments to the agreement, on dissolution or winding up the partnership, on loans \nto the partnership, on a change in its nature of business, on removing or admitting a general or \nlimited partner \n \nHowever, see Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" for how this “control rule” has been \nabolished under ULPA-2001. \nGeneral partners owe fiduciary duties to other general partners, the firm, and the limited partners; limited \npartners who do not exercise control do not owe fiduciary duties. See Figure 13.1 \"The Limited \nPartnership under ULPA-1985\". \n \nFigure 13.1 The Limited Partnership under ULPA-1985 \n \n \nThe partnership agreement may specify which general or limited partners have the right to vote on any \nmatter, but if the agreement grants limited partners voting rights beyond the “safe harbor,” a court may \nabolish that partner’s limited liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n552 \nAssignment of Partnership Rights \nLimited partnership interests may be assigned in whole or in part; if in whole, the assignor ceases to be a \npartner unless otherwise agreed.

However, see the discussion in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited \nLiability Limited Partnerships\" of the newest type of LP, the limited liability limited partnership (triple \nLP), where the general partner is also afforded limited liability under ULPA-2001. \n \nLimited Partners \nThe limited partners are only liable up to the amount of their capital contribution, provided the surname \nof the limited partner does not appear in the partnership name (unless his name is coincidentally the \nsame as that of one of the general partners whose name does appear) and provided the limited partner \ndoes not participate in control of the firm. See Section 13.4.1 \"Limited Partnerships: Limited Partners’ \nLiability for Managing Limited Partnership\" for a case that highlights liability issues for partners. \n \nWe have been discussing ULPA-1985 here. But in a world of limited liability companies, limited liability \npartnerships, and limited liability limited partnerships, “the control rule has become an anachronism”; \nULPA-2001 “provides a full, status-based liability shield for each limited partner, ‘even if the limited \npartner participates in the management and control of the limited partnership.’ [3] The section thus \neliminates the so-called control rule with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n554 \nlimited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.” [4]And as will \nbe noted in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" under ULPA-2001 the general partner \nis also shielded from liability. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the limited partnership meets a minimum number of criteria related to limited liability, \ncentralized management, duration, and transferability of ownership, it can enjoy the benefits of pass-\nthrough taxation; otherwise it will be taxed as a corporation. Pass-through (“conduit”) taxation is usually \nvery important to partners. \nTermination \nThe limited partnership’s termination involves the same three steps as in a general partnership: (1) \ndissolution, (2) winding up, and (3) termination. \n \nDissolution \nDissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not \nnecessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court \norder, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events \nmay cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2)",

Identify how LLCs are terminated. \n \n \nHistory and Law Governing Limited Liability Companies \nHistory of the Limited Liability Company \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n557 \nThe limited liability company (LLC) gained sweeping popularity in the late twentieth century because \nit combines the best aspects of partnership and the best aspects of corporations: it allows all its owners \n(members) insulation from personal liability and pass-through (conduit) taxation. The first efforts to form \nLLCs were thwarted by IRS rulings that the business form was too much like a corporation to escape \ncorporate tax complications. Tinkering by promoters of the LLC concept and flexibility by the IRS solved \nthose problems in interesting and creative ways. \nCorporations have six characteristics: (1) associates, (2) an objective to carry on a business and divide the \ngains, (3) continuity of life, (4) centralized management, (5) limited liability, and (6) free transferability of \ninterests. Partnerships also, necessarily, have the first two corporate characteristics; under IRS rulings, if \nthe LLC is not to be considered a corporation for tax purposes, it must lack at least one-half of the \nremaining four characteristics of a corporation: the LLC, then, must lack two of these corporate \ncharacteristics (otherwise it will be considered a corporation): (1) limited liability, (2) centralized \nmanagement, (3) continuity of life, or (4) free transferability of interests. But limited liability is essential \nand centralized management is necessary for passive investors who don’t want to be involved in decision \nmaking, so pass-through taxation usually hinges on whether an LLC has continuity of life and free \ntransferability of accounts. Thus it is extremely important that the LLC promoters avoid the corporate \ncharacteristics of continuity of life and free transferability of interests. \n \nWe will see how the LLC can finesse these issues. \n \nGoverning Law \nAll states have statutes allowing the creation of LLCs, and while a Uniform Limited Liability Company Act \nhas been promulgated, only eight states have adopted it as of January 2011. That said, the LLC has \nbecome the entity of choice for many businesses. \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nCreation of the LLC \nAn LLC is created according to the statute of the state in which it is formed. It is required that the LLC \nmembers file a “certificate of organization” with the secretary of state, and the name must indicate that it \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n558 \nis a limited liability company. Partnerships and limited partnerships may convert to LLCs; the partners’ \nprevious liability under the other organizational forms is not affected, but going forward, limited liability \nis provided. The members’ operating agreement spells out how the business will be run; it is subordinate \nto state and federal law. Unless otherwise agreed, the operating agreement can be amended only by \nunanimous vote. The LLC is an entity. Foreign LLCs must register with the secretary of state before doing \nbusiness in a “foreign” state, or they cannot sue in state courts. \n \nAs compared with corporations, the LLC is not a good form if the owners expect to have multiple investors \nor to raise money from the public. The typical LLC has relatively few members (six or seven at most), all of \nwhom usually are engaged in running the firm. \n \nMost early LLC statutes, at least, prohibited their use by professionals. That is, practitioners who need \nprofessional licenses, such as certified public accountants, lawyers, doctors, architects, chiropractors, and \nthe like, could not use this form because of concern about what would happen to the standards of practice \nif such people could avoid legitimate malpractice claims. For that reason, the limited liability partnership \nwas invented. \n \nCapitalization \nCapitalization is like a partnership: members contribute capital to the firm according to their agreement. \nAs in a partnership, the LLC property is not specific to any member, but each has a personal property \ninterest in general. Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise",

                    "answer": "A corporation is a legal entity that is separate from its owners, while a limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure that provides its owners with limited liability protection. In a corporation, the owners are called shareholders, and they own shares of stock in the company. The shareholders elect a board of directors, who in turn hire a CEO to run the company. The shareholders have limited liability, meaning that they are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation. In an LLC, the owners are called members, and they have limited liability protection. The members have the ability to manage the company themselves, or they can hire a manager to do so. The members have limited liability, meaning that they are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the LLC. The main difference between a corporation and an LLC is the way in which they are taxed. A corporation is taxed as a separate entity, while an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity. This means that the profits and losses of the LLC are passed through to the members, who are then taxed on their individual tax returns. This can be a significant advantage for LLCs, as it allows them to avoid double taxation. Overall, the main difference between a corporation and an LLC is the way in which they are taxed and the way in which they are managed. Corporations are more complex and have more regulations, while LLCs are more flexible and have fewer regulations."

Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

And by this means the firm does not have continuity of life. Some states provide \nopportunities for even more flexibility regarding the “unanimous” part. In the mid-1990s, the IRS issued \nrevenue rulings (as opposed to regulations) that it would be enough if a “majority in interest” of \nremaining partners agreed to continue the business, and the “flexible” statute states adopted this \npossibility (the ones that did not are called “bulletproof” statutes). “Majority in interests” means a \nmajority of profits and capital. \n \nIf the firm does dissolve, some states require public filings to that effect. If dissolution leads to winding \nup, things progress as in a general partnership: the business at hand is finished, accounts are rendered, \nbills paid, assets liquidated, and remaining assets are distributed to creditors (including member and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n562 \nmanager creditors, but not for their shares in profits); to members and past members for unpaid \ndistributions; to members for capital contributions; and to members as agreed or in proportion to \ncontributions made. Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests. Then \nwe get into the question of how to define “majority”: by number of members or by value of their \nmembership? And what if only the managing partners need to consent? Or if there are two classes of \nmembership and the transfer of interests in one class requires the consent of the other? The point is that \npeople keep pushing the boundaries to see how close their LLC can come to corporation-like status \nwithout being called a corporation.",

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

                    "answer": "The purpose of a limited liability partnership (LLP) is to provide limited liability protection to its partners. In an LLP, the partners are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the partnership, but they are liable for their own negligence or misconduct. This means that if the partnership is sued or incurs debts, the partners are not personally responsible for paying them. The LLP structure is often used by professionals such as lawyers, accountants, and doctors who want to protect their personal assets from the risks of their business."

Union Properties, Inc. \n562 P.2d 244 (Wash. 1977) \n \nPlaintiff [Frigidaire] entered into a contract with Commercial Investors (Commercial), a limited \npartnership. Defendants, Leonard Mannon and Raleigh Baxter, were limited partners of Commercial. \nDefendants were also officers, directors, and shareholders of Union Properties, Inc., the only general \npartner of Commercial. Defendants controlled Union Properties, and through their control of Union \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n570 \nProperties they exercised the day-to-day control and management of Commercial. Commercial breached \nthe contract, and Plaintiff brought suit against Union Properties and Defendants. The trial court \nconcluded that Defendants did not incur general liability for Commercial’s obligations by reason of their \ncontrol of Commercial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. \n \n[Plaintiff] does not contend that Defendants acted improperly by setting up the limited partnership with a \ncorporation as the sole general partner. Limited partnerships are a statutory form of business \norganization, and parties creating a limited partnership must follow the statutory requirements. In \nWashington, parties may form a limited partnership with a corporation as the sole general partner. \n[Citations] \n \nPlaintiff’s sole contention is that Defendants should incur general liability for the limited partnership’s \nobligations under RCW 25.08.070, because they exercised the day-to-day control and management of \nCommercial. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Commercial was controlled by Union Properties, a \nseparate legal entity, and not by Defendants in their individual capacities. [RCW 25.08.070 then read: “A \nlimited partner shall not become liable as a general partner unless, in addition to the exercise of his rights \nand powers as limited partner, he takes part in the control of the business.”] \n \n…The pattern of operation of Union Properties was to investigate and conceive of real estate investment \nopportunities and, when it found such opportunities, to cause the creation of limited partnerships with \nUnion Properties acting as the general partner. Commercial was only one of several limited partnerships \nso conceived and created. Defendants did not form Union Properties for the sole purpose of operating \nCommercial. Hence, their acts on behalf of Union Properties were not performed merely for the benefit of \nCommercial.… \n \n[P]etitioner was never led to believe that Defendants were acting in any capacity other than in their \ncorporate capacities. The parties stipulated at the trial that Defendants never acted in any direct, personal \ncapacity. When the shareholders of a corporation, who are also the corporation’s officers and directors, \nconscientiously keep the affairs of the corporation separate from their personal affairs, and no fraud or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n571 \nmanifest injustice is perpetrated upon third persons who deal with the corporation, the corporation’s \nseparate entity should be respected. [Citations] \n \nFor us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for the limited partnership’s obligations under \nRCW 25.08.070 would require us to apply a literal interpretation of the statute and totally ignore the \ncorporate entity of Union Properties, when Plaintiff knew it was dealing with that corporate entity. There \ncan be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their \ncapacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a \nseparate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff \nentered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president \nand secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it \nwas Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and \ncontrolled the limited partnership. \nFurther, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their \npersonal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general \nliability.

Thinktank then failed to pay plaintiffs for work they had \nperformed.… \n \nOn September 2, 2003, the circuit granted plaintiffs’ motion for judgment on the pleadings against \nThinktank. Thereafter, on October 16, 2003, plaintiffs filed a separate motion for summary judgment \nagainst Topel [personally]. Relying on [Citation], plaintiffs contended that Topel, as a principal of \nThinktank, an LLC, had a legal status similar to a shareholder or director of a corporation, who courts \nhave found liable for a dissolved corporation’s debts. Thus, plaintiffs argued that Topel was personally \nliable for Thinktank’s debts.… \n…The circuit court denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment against Topel.…In doing so, the \ncircuit court acknowledged that Topel continued to do business as Thinktank after its dissolution and that \nthe contractual obligations at issue were incurred after the dissolution. \n \nHowever…the court entered a final order dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims against Topel with \nprejudice.…The court stated in pertinent part: \n \nBased upon the Court’s…finding that the Illinois Legislature did not intend to hold a member of a \nLimited Liability Company liable for debts incurred after the Limited Liability Company had \nbeen involuntarily dissolved, the Court finds that all of Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant Topel \nwithin the Complaint fail as a matter of law, as they are premised upon Defendant Topel’s alleged \npersonal liability for obligations incurred in the name of Thinktank LLC after it had been \ninvoluntarily dissolved by the Illinois Secretary of State.",

In this case, plaintiffs cannot \nestablish either of the provisions in subsection (d). They have not provided this court with Thinktank’s \narticles of organization, much less a provision establishing Topel’s personal liability, nor have they \nprovided this court with Topel’s written adoption of such a provision. As such, under the express language \nof the Act, plaintiffs cannot establish Topel’s personal liability for debts that Thinktank incurred after its \ndissolution.… \n \nIn 1998…the legislature amended [the LLC statute]…and in doing so removed…language which explicitly \nprovided that a member or manager of an LLC could be held personally liable for his or her own actions or \nfor the actions of the LLC to the same extent as a shareholder or director of a corporation could be held \npersonally liable [which would include post-dissolution acts undertaken without authority]. As we have \nnot found any legislative commentary regarding that amendment, we presume that by removing the noted \nstatutory language, the legislature meant to shield a member or manager of an LLC from personal \nliability. [Citation] “When a statute is amended, it is presumed that the legislature intended to change the \nlaw as it formerly existed.” \n \nNonetheless, plaintiffs ask this court to disregard the 1998 amendment and to imply a provision into the \nAct similar to…the Business Corporation Act.

Here, as in the case in Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in LLCs\", there really is no inequitable result. Why is \nthis true? \n \n \n \n \n13.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBetween partnerships and corporations lie a variety of hybrid business forms: limited partnerships, sub-S \ncorporations, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability limited \npartnerships. These business forms were invented to achieve, as much as possible, the corporate benefits \nof limited liability, centralized control, and easy transfer of ownership interest with the tax treatment of a \npartnership. \n \nLimited partnerships were recognized in the early twentieth century and today are governed mostly by the \nUniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA-1985 or ULPA-2001). These entities, not subject to double \ntaxation, are composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general \npartner controls the firm and is liable like a partner in a general partnership (except under ULPA-2001 \nliability is limited); the limited partners are investors and have little say in the daily operations of the \nfirm. If they get too involved, they lose their status as limited partners (except this is not so under ULPA-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n580 \n2001). The general partner, though, can be a corporation, which finesses the liability problem. A limited \npartnership comes into existence only when a certificate of limited partnership is filed with the state. \n \nIn the mid-twentieth century, Congress was importuned to allow small corporations the benefit of pass-\nthrough taxation. It created the sub-S corporation (referring to a section of the IRS code). It affords the \nbenefits of taxation like a partnership and limited liability for its members, but there are several \ninconvenient limitations on how sub-S corporations can be set up and operate. \n \nThe 1990s saw the limited liability company become the entity of choice for many businesspeople. It deftly \ncombines limited liability for all owners—managers and nonmanagers—with pass-through taxation and \nhas none of the restrictions perceived to hobble the sub-S corporate form. Careful crafting of the firm’s \nbylaws and operating certificate allow it to combine the best of all possible business forms. There \nremained, though, one fly in the ointment: most states did not allow professionals to form limited liability \ncompanies (LLCs). \n \nThis last barrier was hurtled with the development of the limited liability partnership. This form, though \nmostly governed by partnership law, eschews the vicarious liability of nonacting partners for another’s \ntorts, malpractice, or partnership breaches of contract. The extent to which such exoneration from \nliability presents a moral hazard—allowing bad actors to escape their just liability—is a matter of concern. \n \nHaving polished off liability for all owners with the LLC and the LLP, the next logical step occurred when \neyes returned to the venerable limited partnership. The invention of the limited liability limited \npartnership in ULPA-2001 not only abolished the “control test” that made limited partners liable if they \ngot too involved in the firm’s operations but also eliminated the general partner’s liability. \n \nTable 13.1 Comparison of Business Organization Forms \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n581 \nType of \nBusiness \nForm \nFormation \nand \nOwnership \nRules \nFunding \nManagement Liability \nTaxes \nDissolution \nLimited \npartnership \nFormal filing \nof articles of \npartnership; \nunlimited \nnumber of \ngeneral and \nlimited partners \nGeneral and \nlimited \npartners \ncontribute \ncapital \nGeneral \npartner \nGeneral partner \npersonally \nliable; limited \npartners to \nextent of \ncontribution[1] \nFlow-\nthrough as \nin \npartnership \nDeath or \ntermination \nof general \npartner, \nunless \notherwise \nagreed \nS \ncorporation \nFormal filing \nof articles of \nincorporation; \nup to 100 \nshareholders \nallowed but \nonly one class \nof stock \nEquity (sell \nstock) or debt \nfunding (issue \nbonds); \nmembers share \nprofits and \nlosses \nBoard of \ndirectors, \nofficers \nOwners not \npersonally liable \nabsent piercing \ncorporate veil \n(see Chapter 14 \n\"Corporation: \nGeneral \nCharacteristics \nand Formation\") \nFlow-\nthrough as \nin \npartnership \nOnly if \nlimited \nduration or \nshareholders \nvote to \ndissolve \nLimited \nliability \ncompany \nFormal filing \nof articles of \norganization; \nunlimited \n“members” \nMembers \nmake capital \ncontributions, \nshare profits \nand losses \nMember \nmanaged or \nmanager \nmanaged \nLimited liability \nFlow-\nthrough as \nin \npartnership. \nUpon death \nor \nbankruptcy, \nunless \notherwise \nagreed \nLimited \nliability \npartnership \n(LLP) \nFormal filing \nof articles of \nLLP \nMembers \nmake capital \ncontributions, \nshare profits \nand losses \nAll partners or \ndelegated to \nmanaging \npartner \nVaries, but \nliability is \ngenerally on \npartnership; \nnonacting \npartners have",

            "chunk": "corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

Distinguish the “public,” or municipal, corporation from the publicly held corporation. \n2. Explain how the tax structure for professional corporations evolved. \n3. Define the two types of business corporations. \n \n \n \nNonprofit Corporations \nOne of the four major classifications of corporations is the nonprofit corporation (also called not-for-\nprofit corporation). It is defined in the American Bar Association’s Model Non-Profit Corporation Act as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n599 \n“a corporation no part of the income of which is distributable to its members, directors or officers.” \nNonprofit corporations may be formed under this law for charitable, educational, civil, religious, social, \nand cultural purposes, among others. \n \nPublic Corporations \nThe true public corporation is a governmental entity. It is often called a municipal corporation, to \ndistinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” \ncorporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, \nand operate under different statutes than do business corporations. \n \nProfessional Corporations \nUntil the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their \nprofessions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the \ndirection of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension. That decision led to a burgeoning number of \nprofessional corporations. \n \n \n \nBusiness Corporations \nThe Two Types \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n600 \nIt is the business corporation proper that we focus on in this unit.

            "chunk": "associations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work. Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated.

Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides \notherwise or unless all the subscribers consent to revocation. In many states that have not adopted the \nmodel act, the contract rule applies and the offer is always revocable. Other states use various common-\nlaw devices to prevent revocation. For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

Although compliance with these requirements is largely a matter of filling in the blanks, two \npoints deserve mention. \n \nFirst, the choice of a name is often critical to the business. Under RMBCA, Section 4.01, the name must \ninclude one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, incorporated, or limited \n(Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The name is not allowed to deceive the public about the corporation’s purposes, \nnor may it be the same as that of any other company incorporated or authorized to do business in the \nstate. \n \nThese legal requirements are obvious; the business requirements are much harder. If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes. Section 3.01 of the RMBCA goes one step further in providing that a corporation \nautomatically “has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business” unless the articles specify a more \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n607 \nlimited purpose. Once completed, the articles of incorporation are delivered to the secretary of state for \nfiling. The existence of a corporation begins once the articles have been filed. \n \nOrganizational Meeting of Directors \nThe first order of business, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, is a meeting of the board of \ndirectors named in the articles of incorporation. They must adopt bylaws, elect officers, and transact any \nother business that may come before the meeting (RMBCA, Section 2.05). Other business would include \naccepting (ratifying) promoters’ contracts, calling for the payment of stock subscriptions, and adopting \nbank resolution forms, giving authority to various officers to sign checks drawn on the corporation. \nSection 10.20 of the RMBCA vests in the directors the power to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws adopted \nat the initial meeting, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. The articles of incorporation may \nreserve the power to modify or repeal exclusively to the shareholders. The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency. An emergency is a situation in which “a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily \nbe assembled because of some catastrophic event.” \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n608",

Filing these articles, or “chartering,” is accomplished at the state level. The secretary of state’s final \napproval gives these articles legal effect. A state cannot change a charter unless it reserves the right when \ngranting the charter. \nIn selecting a state in which to incorporate, a corporation looks for a favorable corporate climate. Delaware \nremains the state of choice for incorporation, particularly for publicly held companies. Most closely held \ncompanies choose to incorporate in their home states. \nFollowing the state selection, the promoter commences his or her functions, which include entering into \ncontracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed (for which he or she can be held liable) and preparing the \narticles of incorporation. \nThe articles of incorporation must include the corporation’s name and its corporate purpose, which can be \nbroad. Finally, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, the corporation’s board of directors must hold an \norganizational meeting. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Distinguish between a de jure and a de facto corporation. \n2. Define the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. \n \n \nDe Jure and De Facto Corporations \nIf promoters meet the requirements of corporate formation, a de jure corporation, considered a legal \nentity, is formed. Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

            "chunk": "Piercing the Corporate Veil \nUnited States v. Bestfoods \n113 F.3d 572 (1998) \n \nSOUTER, JUSTICE \n \nThe United States brought this action under §107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International, \nInc., the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC \nliable because CPC had selected Ott II’s board of directors and populated its executive ranks with CPC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n615 \nofficials, and another CPC official had played a significant role in shaping Ott II’s environmental \ncompliance policy. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf. CERCLA does not purport to \nrewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable common-law backdrop, the congressional \nsilence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 266-267. \nCERCLA’s failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership \ndemands application of the rule that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly to \nthe question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n616 \n \n2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its \nsubsidiary’s facility may be held directly liable in its own right under §107(a)(2) as an operator of the \nfacility. \n \n(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own \nactions. Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility.

Graziano \n355 A.2d. 830 (1976) \n \nEAGEN, JUSTICE. \n \nOn April 30, 1970, RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. [RKO], as seller, entered into an agreement of sale \nwith Jack Jenofsky and Ralph Graziano, as purchasers. This agreement contemplated the sale of the Kent \nTheatre, a parcel of improved commercial real estate located at Cumberland and Kensington Avenues in \nPhiladelphia, for a total purchase price of $70,000. Settlement was originally scheduled for September \n30, 1970, and, at the request of Jenofsky and Graziano, continued twice, first to October 16, 1970, and \nthen to October 21, 1970. However, Jenofsky and Graziano failed to complete settlement on the last \nscheduled date. \n \nSubsequently, on November 13, 1970, RKO filed a complaint in equity seeking judicial enforcement of the \nagreement of sale. Although Jenofsky, in his answer to the complaint, denied personal liability for the \nperformance of the agreement, the chancellor, after a hearing, entered a decree nisi granting the \nrequested relief sought by RKO.…This appeal ensued. \nAt the time of the execution of this agreement, Jenofsky and Graziano were engaged in promoting the \nformation of a corporation to be known as Kent Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting these efforts, Paragraph 19 of \nthe agreement, added by counsel for Jenofsky and Graziano, recited: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n619 \nIt is understood by the parties hereto that it is the intention of the Purchaser to incorporate. Upon \ncondition that such incorporation be completed by closing, all agreements, covenants, and warranties \ncontained herein shall be construed to have been made between Seller and the resultant corporation and \nall documents shall reflect same. \n \nIn fact, Jenofsky and Graziano did file Articles of Incorporation for Kent Enterprises, Inc., with the State \nCorporation Bureau on October 9, 1971, twelve days prior to the scheduled settlement date. Jenofsky now \ncontends the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation \npapers, released him from any personal liability resulting from the non-performance of the agreement. \n \nThe legal relationship of Jenofsky to Kent Enterprises, Inc., at the date of the execution of the agreement \nof sale was that of promoter. As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. \n \n[T]here [are] three possible understandings that parties may have when an agreement is executed by a \npromoter on behalf of a proposed corporation: \nWhen a party is acting for a proposed corporation, he cannot, of course, bind it by anything he does, at the \ntime, but he may (1) take on its behalf an offer from the other which, being accepted after the formation of \nthe company, becomes a contract; (2) make a contract at the time binding himself, with the stipulation or \nunderstanding, that if a company is formed it will take his place and that then he shall be relieved of \nresponsibility; or (3) bind himself personally without more and look to the proposed company, when \nformed, for indemnity. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n620 \n \nBoth RKO and Jenofsky concede the applicability of alternative No. 2 to the instant case. That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed,",

Initial public offerings and consideration for stock \n5. What dividends are \n6. Some of the modern trends in corporate finance \n \n \nA corporation requires money for many reasons. In this chapter, we look at the methods available to \na corporation for raising funds, focusing on how firms generate large amounts of funds and finance \nlarge projects, such as building a new factory. \n \nOne major method of finance is the sale of stock. A corporation sells shares of stock, often in an \ninitial public offering. In exchange for consideration—usually cash—the purchaser acquires stock in \nthe corporation. This stock may give the owner a share in earnings, the right to transfer the stock, \nand, depending on the size of the corporation and the number of shares, power to exercise control. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n630 \nOther methods of corporate finance include bank financing and bonds. We also discuss some more \nmodern financing methods, such as private equity and venture capital. Additional methods of \ncorporate finance, such as commercial paper (see Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial \nPaper\" and Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\"), are discussed elsewhere in this book. \n \n \n \n \n \n15.1 General Sources of Corporate Funds \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Discuss the main sources for raising corporate funds. \n2. Examine the reinvestment of earnings to finance growth. \n3. Review debt and equity as methods of raising funds. \n4. Consider private equity and venture capital, and compare their utility to other forms of financing. \n \n \nSources \nTo finance growth, any ongoing business must have a source of funds. Apart from bank and trade debt, \nthe principal sources are plowback, debt securities, equity securities, and private equity. \n \nPlowback \nA significant source of new funds that corporations spend on capital projects is earnings. Rather than \npaying out earnings to shareholders, the corporation plows those earnings back into the \nbusiness. Plowback is simply reinvesting earnings in the corporation. It is an attractive source of capital \nbecause it is subject to managerial control. No approval by governmental agencies is necessary for its \nexpenditure, as it is when a company seeks to sell securities, or stocks and bonds. Furthermore, stocks \nand bonds have costs associated with them, such as the interest payments on bonds (discussed in Section \n15.1.3 \"Debt Securities\"), while retaining profits avoids these costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n631 \n \nDebt Securities \nA second source of funds is borrowing through debt securities. A corporation may take out a debt security \nsuch as a loan, commonly evidenced by a note and providing security to the lender. This is covered \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual \nLiens\". A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do",

Surplus is divided into earned surplus (essentially the company’s retained \nearnings) and capital surplus (all surpluses other than earned surplus). We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock. Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt). Thus corporations issue preferred stock to attract more conservative investors: common \nstock is riskier than preferred stock, so corporations can attract more investors if they have both preferred \nand common stock. \n \nPreference to Dividends \nA dividend is a payment made to stockholders from corporate profits. Assume that one class of preferred \nstock is entitled to a 7 percent dividend. The percentage applies to the par value; if par value is $100, each \nshare of preferred is entitled to a dividend of $7 per year. Assuming the articles of incorporation say so, \nthis 7 percent preferred stock has preference over other classes of shares for dividend payments. \n \nLiquidation Preference \nAn additional right of preferred shareholders is the right to share in the distribution of assets in the event \nof liquidation, after having received assets under a liquidation preference—that is, a preference, according \nto a predetermined formula, to receive the assets of the company on liquidation ahead of other classes of \nshareholders. \n \nConvertible Shares \nWith one exception, the articles of incorporation may grant the right to convert any class of stock into any \nother at the holder’s option according to a fixed ratio. Alternatively, the corporation may force a \nconversion of a shareholder’s convertible stock. Thus if permitted, a preferred shareholder may convert \nhis or her preferred shares into common stock, or vice versa. The exception bars conversion of stock into a \nclass with an asset liquidation preference, although some states permit even that type of so-called \nupstream conversion to a senior security. Convertible preferred shares can be used as a poison pill (a \ncorporate strategy to avoid a hostile takeover): when an outsider seeks to gain control, convertible \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n639 \nshareholders may elect to convert their preferred shares into common stock, thus increasing the number \nof common shares and increasing the number of shares the outsider must purchase in order to gain \ncontrol. \n \nRedeemable Shares \nThe articles of incorporation may provide for the redemption of shares, unless in doing so the corporation \nwould become insolvent. Redemption may be either at an established price and time or by election of the \ncorporation or the shareholder. Redeemed stock is called cancelled stock. Unless the articles of \nincorporation prohibit it, the shares are considered authorized but unissued and can be reissued as the \nneed arises. If the articles of incorporation specifically make the cancellation permanent, then the total \nnumber of authorized shares is reduced, and new shares cannot be reissued without amending the articles \nof incorporation. In this case, the redeemed shares cannot be reissued and must be marked as cancelled \nstock. \n \nVoting Rights \nOrdinarily, the articles of incorporation provide that holders of preferred shares do not have a voting \nright. Or they may provide for contingent voting rights, entitling preferred shareholders to vote on the \nhappening of a particular event—for example, the nonpayment of a certain number of dividends. The \narticles may allow class voting for directors, to ensure that the class of preferred stockholders has some \nrepresentation on the board. \n \nCommon Stock \nCommon stock is different from preferred stock. Common stock represents an ownership interest in a \ncorporation. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, common stockholders have the \nfollowing rights: \n1. Voting rights. This is a key difference: preferred shareholders usually do not have the right to vote. \nCommon shareholders express their ownership interest in the corporation by voting. Votes are cast at \nmeetings, typically the annual meetings, and the shareholders can vote for directors and on other \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n640 \nimportant corporate decisions (e.g., there has been a recent push to allow shareholders to vote on \nexecutive compensation). \n2. The right to ratable participation in earnings (i.e., in proportion to the total shares) and/or the right to \nratable participation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation. Bondholders and other creditors \nhave seniority upon liquidation, but if they have been satisfied, or the corporation has no debt, the \ncommon shareholders may ratably recover from what is left over in liquidation.",

                    "answer": "Preferred stock is a type of stock that has a higher priority than common stock when it comes to receiving dividends and other payments from a company. Common stock, on the other hand, is the most common type of stock and is typically the lowest priority when it comes to receiving payments from a company. Preferred stock also typically has a higher dividend yield than common stock, and it may also have other special rights and privileges, such as the right to vote on certain matters or the right to convert to common stock. Common stock, on the other hand, typically does not have these special rights and privileges, and it may have a lower dividend yield than preferred stock. Overall, preferred stock is a more conservative investment than common stock, as it has a higher priority when it comes to receiving payments from a company and it may have other special rights and privileges that common stock does not have."

Shares have different designations, \ndepending on who holds the shares. The two main types of stock are preferred stock and common stock, each \nwith rights that often differ from the rights of the other. Preferred stock has elements of both debt and \nequity. Holders of preferred shares have a dividend preference and have a right to share in the distribution of \nassets in liquidation. Holders of common stock have a different set of rights, namely, the right to vote on \nimportant corporate decisions such as the election of directors. A corporation may purchase some of its \nshares from its shareholders in a process called a buyback. Stock in the hands of the corporation is called \ntreasury stock. There are a variety of factors that a corporation must consider in determining whether to raise \ncapital through bonds or through stock issuance. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understand what an initial public offering is and under what circumstances one is usually done. \n2. Examine the various requirements of selling stock. \n3. Discuss what adequate and valid consideration is in exchange for stock. \n \n \nSale of stock \nRather than using debt to finance operations, a corporation may instead sell stock. This is most often \naccomplished through an initial public offering (IPO), or the first time a corporation offers stock for \nsale to the public. The sale of securities, such as stock, is governed by the Securities Act of 1933. In \nparticular, Section 5 of the 1933 act governs the specifics of the sale of securities. To return to BCT \nBookstore, Inc., suppose the company wishes to sell stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for \nthe first time. That would be an IPO. The company would partner with securities lawyers and investment \nbanks to accomplish the sale. The banks underwrite the sale of the securities: in exchange for a fee, the \nbank will buy the shares from BCT and then sell them. The company and its team prepare a registration \nstatement, which contains required information about the IPO and is submitted to the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC). The SEC reviews the registration statement and makes the decision \nwhether to permit or prohibit BCT’s IPO. Once the SEC approves the IPO, BCT’s investment banks \npurchase the shares in the primary market and then resell them to investors on the secondary market on \nthe NYSE. (For a further discussion of these two markets, see Chapter 17 \"Securities Regulation\"). Stock \nsales are not limited to an IPO—publicly traded corporations may sell stock several times after going \npublic. The requirements of the 1933 act remain but are loosened for well-known corporations (well-\nknown seasoned issuers). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n644 \nAn IPO or stock sale has several advantages. A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example,",

A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example, \nemployment compensation may be in the form of stock, such as in an employee stock ownership plan. \nInvestors also seek common stock, whether in an IPO or in the secondary market. While common stock is \na riskier investment than a bond, stock ownership can have tremendous upside—after all, the sky is the \nlimit on the price of a stock. On the other hand, there is the downside: the price of the stock can plummet, \ncausing the shareholder significant monetary loss. \n \nCertainly, an IPO has some disadvantages. Ownership is diluted: BCT had very few owners before its IPO \nbut may have millions of owners after the IPO. As mentioned, an IPO can be expensive. An IPO can also \nbe undervalued: the corporation and its investment banks may undervalue the IPO stock price, causing \nthe corporation to lose out on the difference between its determined price and the market price. Being a \npublic corporation also places the corporation under the purview of the SEC and requires ongoing \ndisclosures. Timing can be problematic: the registration review process can take several weeks. The stock \nmarkets can change drastically over that waiting period. Furthermore, the offering could have insufficient \npurchasers to raise sufficient funds; that is, the public might not have enough interest in purchasing the \ncompany’s stock to bring in sufficient funds to the corporation. Finally, a firm that goes public releases \ninformation that is available to the public, which could be useful to competitors (trade secrets, \ninnovations, new technology, etc.). \n \nAs mentioned, one of the main disadvantages of going public is the SEC review and disclosure \nrequirements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs most secondary market transactions. The \n1934 act places certain requirements on corporations that have sold securities. Both the 1933 and 1934 \nacts require corporations to disseminate information to the public and/or its investors. These \nrequirements were strengthened after the collapse of Enron in 2001. The SEC realized that its disclosure \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n645 \nrequirements were not strong enough, as demonstrated by the accounting tricks and downfall of Enron \nand its accountant, Arthur Andersen. [1] \n \nAs a result of Enron’s accounting scandal, as well as problems with other corporations, Congress \ntightened the noose by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. [2] This act increased the disclosure of \nfinancial information, increased transparency, and required the dissemination of information about what \na corporation was doing. For example, Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a corporation’s chief \nexecutive officer and chief financial officer certify annual and quarterly reports and state that the report \ndoes not contain any material falsehoods and that the financial data accurately reflect the corporation’s \ncondition. \n \nNature of the Consideration \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. While cash is commonly used to purchase \nstock, a stock purchaser may pay with something other than cash, such as property, whether tangible or \nintangible, or services or labor performed for the corporation. In most states, promissory notes and \ncontracts for future services are not lawful forms of consideration. The case United Steel Industries, Inc. \nv. Manhart, (see Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), illustrates the problems that can \narise when services or promises of future delivery are intended as payment for stock. \n \n \nEvaluating the Consideration: Watered Stock \nIn United Steel Industries (Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), assume that Griffitts’s \nlegal services had been thought by the corporation to be worth $6,000 but in fact were worth $1,000, and \nthat he had received stock with par value of $6,000 (i.e., 6,000 shares of $1 par value stock) in exchange \nfor his services. Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646",

As noted near the end of the United Steel \nIndustries case, in the absence of fraud, “the judgment of the board of directors ‘as to the value of \nconsideration received for shares’ is conclusive.” In other words, if the directors or shareholders conclude \nin good faith that the consideration does fairly reflect par value, then the stock is not watered and the \nstock buyer cannot be assessed for the difference. This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable. The minority approach is the true value rule: the consideration must in fact equal par \nvalue by an objective standard at the time the shares are issued, regardless of the board’s good-faith \njudgment. \n \nA shareholder may commence a derivative lawsuit (a suit by a shareholder, on behalf of the corporation, \noften filed against the corporation; see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"). In a watered \nstock lawsuit, the derivative suit is filed against a shareholder who has failed to pay full consideration \nunder either rule to recover the difference between the value received by the corporation and the par \nvalue. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations may raise funds through the sale of stock. This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. Most investors will exchange money for stock. \nCertain forms of consideration are not permitted. Finally, a corporation may be liable if it sells watered stock, \nwhere consideration received by the corporation is less than the stock par value. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified",

Know the modern changes to corporate finance terminology and specific requirements imposed by states. \n2. Compare the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to corporate finance with the applicability of the \n1933 and 1934 federal securities acts. \n \n \nChanges in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n653 \nPerhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \n(RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation. [1] \n \nTherefore, although the modern trend is to move away from par value as well as some other previously \ndiscussed terms—and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts—they still, in large measure, \npersist. \n \nIntroduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n654 \nPartial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of \ntransfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the",

They may apply profits in payment of \nfloating or funded debts, or in development of the company’s business; and so long as they do not \nabuse their discretionary powers, or violate the company’s charter, the courts cannot interfere. \n \nBut it is clear that the agents of a corporation, and even the majority, cannot arbitrarily withhold \nprofits earned by the company, or apply them to any use which is not authorized by the \ncompany’s charter.… \n \nMr. Henry Ford is the dominant force in the business of the Ford Motor Company. No plan of operations \ncould be adopted unless he consented, and no board of directors can be elected whom he does not favor. \nOne of the directors of the company has no stock. One share was assigned to him to qualify him for the \nposition, but it is not claimed that he owns it. A business, one of the largest in the world, and one of the \nmost profitable, has been built up. It employs many men, at good pay. \n \n“My ambition,” said Mr. Ford, “is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this \nindustrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their \nhomes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.” \n \n“With regard to dividends, the company paid sixty per cent on its capitalization of two million \ndollars, or $1,200,000, leaving $58,000,000 to reinvest for the growth of the company. This is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n660 \nMr. Ford’s policy at present, and it is understood that the other stockholders cheerfully accede to \nthis plan.” \n \nHe had made up his mind in the summer of 1916 that no dividends other than the regular dividends \nshould be paid, “for the present.” \n \n“Q. For how long? Had you fixed in your mind any time in the future, when you were going to \npay— \n“A. No. \n“Q. That was indefinite in the future? \n“A. That was indefinite, yes, sir.” \n \nThe record, and especially the testimony of Mr. Ford, convinces that he has to some extent the attitude \ntowards shareholders of one who has dispensed and distributed to them large gains and that they should \nbe content to take what he chooses to give. His testimony creates the impression, also, that he thinks the \nFord Motor Company has made too much money, has had too large profits, and that although large profits \nmight be still earned, a sharing of them with the public, by reducing the price of the output of the \ncompany, ought to be undertaken. We have no doubt that certain sentiments, philanthropic and altruistic, \ncreditable to Mr. Ford, had large influence in determining the policy to be pursued by the Ford Motor \nCompany—the policy which has been herein referred to. \n \n* * * \n \nThe difference between an incidental humanitarian expenditure of corporate funds for the benefit of the \nemployees, like the building of a hospital for their use and the employment of agencies for the betterment \nof their condition, and a general purpose and plan to benefit mankind at the expense of others, is obvious. \nThere should be no confusion (of which there is evidence) of the duties which Mr. Ford conceives that he \nand the stockholders owe to the general public and the duties which in law he and his codirectors owe to \nprotesting, minority stockholders. A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n661 \nprofit of the stockholders. The powers of the directors are to be employed for that end. The discretion of \ndirectors is to be exercised in the choice of means to attain that end and does not extend to a change in the \nend itself, to the reduction of profits or to the nondistribution of profits among stockholders in order to \ndevote them to other purposes. \n \n* * * \n \nWe are not, however, persuaded that we should interfere with the proposed expansion of the business of \nthe Ford Motor Company. In view of the fact that the selling price of products may be increased at any \ntime, the ultimate results of the larger business cannot be certainly estimated. The judges are not business \nexperts. It is recognized that plans must often be made for a long future, for expected competition, for a \ncontinuing as well as an immediately profitable venture. The experience of the Ford Motor Company is \nevidence of capable management of its affairs. It may be noticed, incidentally, that it took from the public",

In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow \nmoney, issue notes and bonds, lend money, invest funds, make donations to the public welfare, and \nestablish pension plans; and to join in partnerships, joint ventures, trusts, or other enterprises. The \npowers set out in this section need not be included in the articles of incorporation. \n \nImplied Powers \nCorporate powers beyond those explicitly established are implied powers. For example, suppose BCT \nBookstore, Inc.’s statement of purpose reads simply, “to operate a bookstore.” The company may lawfully \nconduct all acts that are necessary or appropriate to running a bookstore—hiring employees, advertising \nspecial sales, leasing trucks, and so forth. Could Ted, its vice president and general manager, authorize the \nexpenditure of funds to pay for a Sunday afternoon lecture on the perils of nuclear war or the adventures \nof a professional football player? Yes—if the lectures are relevant to current books on sale or serve to bring \npeople into the store, they comply with the corporation’s purpose. \n \n \nThe Ultra Vires Doctrine \nThe law places limitations upon what acts a corporation may undertake. Corporations cannot do anything \nthey wish, but rather, must act within the prescribed rules as laid out in statute, case law, their articles of \nincorporation, and their bylaws. Sometimes, though, a corporation will step outside its permitted power \n(literally “beyond the powers). The ultra vires doctrine holds that certain legal consequences attach to \nan attempt by a corporation to carry out acts that are outside its lawful powers. Ultra vires (literally \n“beyond the powers”) is not limited to illegal acts, although it encompasses actions barred by statute as \nwell as by the corporate charter. Under the traditional approach, either the corporation or the other party \ncould assert ultra vires as a defense when refusing to abide by a wholly executory contract. The ultra vires \ndoctrine loses much of its significance when corporate powers are broadly stated in a corporation’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n669 \narticles. Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers. [1] See Adam Sulkowski’s “Ultra Vires Statutes: Alive, Kicking, and a Means \nof Circumventing the Scalia Standing Gauntlet.” [2] \n \nIn essence, ultra vires retains force in three circumstances: \n \n1. Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3. The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670",

The state attorney general may assert the doctrine in a proceeding to dissolve the corporation or to \nenjoin it from transacting unauthorized business (see Figure 16.1 \"Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts\"). \n \nFigure 16.1 Attacks on Ultra Vires Acts \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n670 \nSuppose an incorporated luncheon club refuses to admit women as club members or guests. What \nhappens if this action is ultra vires? Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. (see Section 16.5.1 \"Ultra Vires \nActs\"), focuses on this issue. An ultra vires act is not necessarily criminal or tortious. However, every \ncrime and tort is in some sense ultra vires because a corporation never has legal authority to commit \ncrimes or torts. They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent. An additional dilemma was that society could not \nliterally imprison a corporation. Modern law is not so constricting. Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail. Legal punishments \nare being routinely added to the newer regulatory statutes, such as the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and the Toxic Substances Control Act—although prosecution depends mainly on whether and where a \nparticular administration wishes to spend its enforcement dollars. Additionally, state prosecuting \nattorneys have become more active in filing criminal charges against management when employees are \ninjured or die on the job. For instance, a trial court judge in Chicago sentenced a company president, \nplant manager, and foreman to twenty-five years in prison after they were convicted of murder following \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n671 \nthe death of a worker as a result of unsafe working conditions at a plant; [3] the punishments were later \noverturned, but the three pled guilty several years later and served shorter sentences of varying duration. \n \nMore recently, prosecutors have been expanding their prosecutions of corporations and developing \nmethodologies to evaluate whether a corporation has committed a criminal act; for example, US Deputy \nAttorney General Paul McNulty revised “Principles of Federal Prosecutions of Business Organizations” in \n2006 to further guide prosecutors in indicting corporations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require",

Timely notice \nis required: not more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the meeting, under Section 7.05 of the \nRevised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA). Shareholders may take actions without a meeting if \nevery shareholder entitled to vote consents in writing to the action to be taken. This option is obviously \nuseful to the closely held corporation but not to the giant publicly held companies. \n \nRight to Vote \nWho Has the Right to Vote? \nThrough its bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors, a corporation can set a “record date.” Only \nthe shareholders listed on the corporate records on that date receive notice of the next shareholders’ \nmeeting and have the right to vote. Every share is entitled to one vote unless the articles of incorporation \nstate otherwise. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n674 \n \nThe one-share, one-vote principle, commonly called regular voting or statutory voting, is not required, \nand many US companies have restructured their voting rights in an effort to repel corporate raiders. For \ninstance, a company might decide to issue both voting and nonvoting shares (as we discussed in Chapter \n16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"), with the voting shares going to insiders who thereby control \nthe corporation. In response to these new corporate structures, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) adopted a one-share, one-vote rule in 1988 that was designed to protect a shareholder’s right to \nvote. In 1990, however, a federal appeals court overturned the SEC rule on the grounds that voting rights \nare governed by state law rather than by federal law. [1] \n \nQuorum \nWhen the articles of incorporation are silent, a shareholder quorum is a simple majority of the shares \nentitled to vote, whether represented in person or by proxy, according to RMBCA Section 7.25. Thus if \nthere are 1 million shares, 500,001 must be represented at the shareholder meeting. A simple majority of \nthose represented shares is sufficient to carry any motion, so 250,001 shares are enough to decide upon a \nmatter other than the election of directors (governed by RMBCA, Section 7.28). The articles of \nincorporation may decree a different quorum but not less than one-third of the total shares entitled to \nvote. \n \nCumulative Voting \nCumulative voting means that a shareholder may distribute his total votes in any manner that he \nchooses—all for one candidate or several shares for different candidates. With cumulative voting, each \nshareholder has a total number of votes equal to the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number \nof directors to be elected. Thus if a shareholder has 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, \nthe shareholder has 5,000 votes, and he may vote those shares in a manner he desires (all for one \ndirector, or 2,500 each for two directors, etc.). Some states permit this right unless the articles of \nincorporation deny it. Other states deny it unless the articles of incorporation permit it. Several states \nhave constitutional provisions requiring cumulative voting for corporate directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n675 \nCumulative voting is meant to provide minority shareholders with representation on the board. Assume \nthat Bob and Carol each owns 2,000 shares, which they have decided to vote as a block, and Ted owns \n6,000 shares. At their annual shareholder meeting, they are to elect five directors. Without cumulative \nvoting, Ted’s slate of directors would win: under statutory voting, each share represents one vote available \nfor each director position. With this method, by placing as many votes as possible for each director, Ted \ncould cast 6,000 votes for each of his desired directors. Thus each of Ted’s directors would receive 6,000 \nvotes, while each of Bob and Carol’s directors would receive only 4,000. Under cumulative voting, \nhowever, each shareholder has as many votes as there are directors to be elected. Hence with cumulative \nvoting Bob and Carol could strategically distribute their 20,000 votes (4,000 votes multiplied by five \ndirectors) among the candidates to ensure representation on the board. By placing 10,000 votes each on \ntwo of their candidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board.

So \nSection 8.08 provides, “If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of \nvotes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal.” \n \nVoting Arrangements to Concentrate Power \nShareholders use three types of arrangements to concentrate their power: proxies, voting agreements, and \nvoting trusts. \n \nProxies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n676 \nA proxy is the representative of the shareholder. A proxy may be a person who stands in for the \nshareholder or may be a written instrument by which the shareholder casts her votes before the \nshareholder meeting. Modern proxy voting allows shareholders to vote electronically through the \nInternet, such as at http://www.proxyvoting.com. Proxies are usually solicited by and given to \nmanagement, either to vote for proposals or people named in the proxy or to vote however the proxy \nholder wishes. Through the proxy device, management of large companies can maintain control over the \nelection of directors. Proxies must be signed by the shareholder and are valid for eleven months from the \ntime they are received by the corporation unless the proxy explicitly states otherwise. Management may \nuse reasonable corporate funds to solicit proxies if corporate policy issues are involved, but \nmisrepresentations in the solicitation can lead a court to nullify the proxies and to deny reimbursement \nfor the solicitation cost. Only the last proxy given by a particular shareholder can be counted. \n \nProxy solicitations are regulated by the SEC. For instance, SEC rules require companies subject to the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to file proxy materials with the SEC at least ten days before proxies are \nmailed to shareholders. Proxy statements must disclose all material facts, and companies must use a \nproxy form on which shareholders can indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the proposals. \n \nDissident groups opposed to management’s position are entitled to solicit their own proxies at their own \nexpense. The company must either furnish the dissidents with a list of all shareholders and addresses or \nmail the proxies at corporate expense. Since management usually prefers to keep the shareholder list \nprivate, dissidents can frequently count on the corporation to foot the mailing bill. \n \nVoting Agreements \nUnless they intend to commit fraud on a minority of stockholders, shareholders may agree in advance to \nvote in specific ways. Such a voting agreement, often called a shareholder agreement, is generally legal. \nShareholders may agree in advance, for example, to vote for specific directors; they can even agree to vote \nfor the dissolution of the corporation in the event that a predetermined contingency occurs.

A voting agreement also permits shareholders to \nretain their shares rather than turning the shares over to a trust, as would be required in a voting trust. \n \nVoting Trusts \nTo ensure that shareholder agreements will be honored, shareholders in most states can create \na voting trust. By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting",

These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth. Improper purposes include uncovering trade \nsecrets for sale to a competitor or compiling mailing lists for personal business purposes. A shareholder’s \nmotivation is an important factor in determining whether the purpose is proper, as the courts attempt to \nbalance the rights of both the shareholders and the corporation. For example, a Minnesota court applied \nDelaware law in finding that a shareholder’s request to view the corporation’s shareholder ledger to \nidentify shareholders and communicate with them about the corporation’s involvement in the Vietnam \nWar was improper. A desire to communicate with the other corporate shareholders was found to be \ninsufficient to compel inspection. [2] Contrast that finding with a Delaware court’s finding that a \nshareholder had a proper purpose in requesting a corporation’s shareholder list in order to communicate \nwith them about the economic risks of the firm’s involvement in Angola. [3] \nPreemptive Rights \nAssume that BCT Bookstore has outstanding 5,000 shares with par value of ten dollars and that Carol \nowns 1,000. At the annual meeting, the shareholders decide to issue an additional 1,000 shares at par and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n678 \nto sell them to Alice. Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it. Preemptive rights were \nonce strongly favored, but they are increasingly disappearing, especially in large publicly held companies \nwhere ownership is already highly diluted. \n \nDerivative Actions \nSuppose Carol discovers that Ted has been receiving kickbacks from publishers and has been splitting the \nproceeds with Bob. When at a directors’ meeting, Carol demands that the corporation file suit to recover \nthe sums they pocketed, but Bob and Ted outvote her. Carol has another remedy. She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act. Although the corporation is named as a defendant in the \nsuit, the corporation itself is the so-called real party in interest—the party entitled to recover if the \nplaintiff wins. \n \nWhile derivative actions are subject to abuse by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking settlements that pay their \nfees, safeguards have been built into the law. At least ninety days before starting a derivative action, for \ninstance, shareholders must demand in writing that the corporation take action. Shareholders may not \ncommence derivative actions unless they were shareholders at the time of the wrongful act. Derivative \nactions may be dismissed if disinterested directors decide that the proceeding is not in the best interests \nof the corporation. (A disinterested director is a director who has no interest in the disputed \ntransaction.) Derivative actions are discussed further in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n679 \n \nIn large publicly traded corporations, shareholders own the corporation but have limited power to affect \ndecisions.

In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

Technicolor, \nInc., [8] In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, [9] and Smith v. Van Gorkom. [10] \n \nIf a shareholder is not pleased by a director’s decision, that shareholder may file a derivative suit. The \nderivative suit may be filed by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against directors or officers of \nthe corporation, alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations. However, a shareholder, as a prerequisite to \nfiling a derivative action, must first demand that the board of directors take action, as the actual party in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n690 \ninterest is the corporation, not the shareholder (meaning that if the shareholder is victorious in the \nlawsuit, it is actually the corporation that “wins”). If the board refuses, is its decision protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule? The general rule is that the board may refuse to file a derivative suit and will be \nprotected by the business judgment rule. And even when a derivative suit is filed, directors can be \nprotected by the business judgment rule for decisions even the judge considers to have been poorly made. \nSee In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, (see Section 16.5.2 \"Business Judgment Rule\"). \n \nIn a battle for control of a corporation, directors (especially “inside” directors, who are employees of the \ncorporation, such as officers) often have an inherent self-interest in preserving their positions, which can \nlead them to block mergers that the shareholders desire and that may be in the firm’s best interest. As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum, [11] for instance, the court held that directors who adopt a defensive \nmechanism “must show that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy \nand effectiveness existed.…[T]hey satisfy that burden ‘by showing good faith and reasonable \ninvestigation.’” The business judgment rule clearly does not protect every decision of the board. \nThe Unocal court developed a test for the board: the directors may only work to prevent a takeover when \nthey can demonstrate a threat to the policies of the corporation and that any defensive measures taken to \nprevent the takeover were reasonable and proportional given the depth of the threat. The Unocal test was \nmodified further by requiring a finding, before a court steps in, that the actions of a board were coercive, a \nstep back toward the business judgment rule. [12] \n \nIn a widely publicized case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Time, Inc. met \nthe Unocal test—that the board reasonably concluded that a tender offer by Paramount constituted a \nthreat and acted reasonably in rejecting Paramount’s offer and in merging with Warner \nCommunications. [13] \n \nThe specific elements of the fiduciary duties are not spelled out in stone. For example, the Delaware \ncourts have laid out three factors to examine when determining whether a duty of care has been \nbreached: [14] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n691 \n \n1. The directors knew, or should have known, that legal breaches were occurring. \n2. The directors took no steps to prevent or resolve the situation. \n3. This failure caused the losses about which the shareholder is complaining in a derivative suit. \n \nThus the court expanded the duty of oversight (which is included under the umbrella of the duty of care; \nthese duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation.

So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies. Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal. For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers. In particular, Title III contains corporate responsibility \nprovisions, such as requiring senior executives to vouch for the accuracy and completeness of their \ncorporation’s financial disclosures. While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in",

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

Supp. 150; 365 A.2d 1227 (Conn. 1976) \n \nSTAPLETON, JUDGE. \n \nThe following facts are admitted or undisputed: The plaintiff is a member in good standing of the \ndefendant nonstock Connecticut corporation. Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation \nand its directors, the plaintiff is also seeking injunctive relief, orders directing the admission of the \nplaintiff’s candidate to membership and denying indemnity to the directors, money damages, and costs \nand expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees. It should be noted at the outset that the plaintiff is not \nmaking a claim under either the federal or state civil rights or equal accommodations statutes, but that he \nis solely asserting his membership rights under the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, and the \nstatutes governing the regulation of this nonstock corporation. As such, this is a case of first impression in \nConnecticut. \n \n* * * \nConnecticut has codified the common-law right of a member to proceed against his corporation or its \ndirectors in the event of an ultra vires act. In fact, it has been done specifically under the Nonstock \nCorporation Act. \n \nNo powers were given to the defendant corporation in its certificate of incorporation, only a purpose, and \nas a result the only incidental powers which the defendant would have under the common law are those \nwhich are necessary to effect its purpose, that being to serve lunch to its members. Since the club was not \nformed for the purpose of having an exclusively male luncheon club, it cannot be considered necessary to \nits stated purpose for the club to have the implied power at common law to exclude women members. \n \nUnder the Connecticut Nonstock Corporation Act, the corporation could have set forth in its certificate of \nincorporation that its purpose was to engage in any lawful activity permitted that corporation. That was \nnot done. Its corporate purposes were very narrowly stated to be solely for providing “facilities for the \nserving of luncheon or other meals to members.” The certificate did not restrict the purpose to the serving \nof male members. Section 33-428 of the General Statutes provides that the corporate powers of a \nnonstock corporation are those set forth in the Nonstock Corporation Act, those specifically stated in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n700 \ncertificate of incorporation, neither of which includes the power to exclude women members, and the \nimplied power to “exercise all legal powers necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes \nstated in its certificate of incorporation.…” \n \nWe come, thus, to the nub of this controversy and the basic legal question raised by the facts in this case: \nIs it necessary or convenient to the purpose for which this corporation was organized for it to exclude \nwomen members? This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated",

The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith. \n \nThis argument lacks merit. To make the argument the appellants must ignore the distinction between (i) a \ndetermination of bad faith for the threshold purpose of rebutting the business judgment rule \npresumptions, and (ii) a bad faith determination for purposes of evaluating the availability of charter-\nauthorized exculpation from monetary damage liability after liability has been established. Our law clearly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n703 \npermits a judicial assessment of director good faith for that former purpose. Nothing in Emerald \nPartners requires the Court of Chancery to consider only evidence of lack of due care (i.e. gross \nnegligence) in determining whether the business judgment rule presumptions have been rebutted.… \n \nThe appellants argue that the Disney directors breached their duty of care by failing to inform themselves \nof all material information reasonably available with respect to Ovitz’s employment agreement.…[but the] \nonly properly reviewable action of the entire board was its decision to elect Ovitz as Disney’s President. In \nthat context the sole issue, as the Chancellor properly held, is “whether [the remaining members of the old \nboard] properly exercised their business judgment and acted in accordance with their fiduciary duties \nwhen they elected Ovitz to the Company’s presidency.” The Chancellor determined that in electing Ovitz, \nthe directors were informed of all information reasonably available and, thus, were not grossly negligent. \nWe agree. \n \n…[The court turns to good faith.] The Court of Chancery held that the business judgment rule \npresumptions protected the decisions of the compensation committee and the remaining Disney \ndirectors, not only because they had acted with due care but also because they had not acted in bad faith. \nThat latter ruling, the appellants claim, was reversible error because the Chancellor formulated and then \napplied an incorrect definition of bad faith. \n \n…Their argument runs as follows: under the Chancellor’s 2003 definition of bad faith, the directors must \nhave “consciously and intentionally disregarded their responsibilities, adopting a ‘we don’t care about \nthe risks’ attitude concerning a material corporate decision.” Under the 2003 formulation, appellants say, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation[,]” but under the 2005 post-trial definition, bad faith \nrequires proof of a subjective bad motive or intent. This definitional change, it is claimed, was \nprocedurally prejudicial because appellants relied on the 2003 definition in presenting their evidence of \nbad faith at the trial.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

They argue that the 2003 formulation was (and is) the correct definition, because it is \n“logically tied to board decision-making under the duty of care.” The post-trial formulation, on the other \nhand, “wrongly incorporated substantive elements regarding the rationality of the decisions under review \nrather than being constrained, as in a due care analysis, to strictly procedural criteria.” We conclude that \nboth arguments must fail. \n \nThe appellants’ first argument—that there is a real, significant difference between the Chancellor’s pre-\ntrial and post-trial definitions of bad faith—is plainly wrong. We perceive no substantive difference \nbetween the Court of Chancery’s 2003 definition of bad faith—a “conscious and intentional disregard [of] \nresponsibilities, adopting a we don’t care about the risks’ attitude…”—and its 2005 post-trial definition—\nan “intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities.” Both formulations \nexpress the same concept, although in slightly different language. \n \nThe most telling evidence that there is no substantive difference between the two formulations is that the \nappellants are forced to contrive a difference. Appellants assert that under the 2003 formulation, \n“directors violate their duty of good faith if they are making material decisions without adequate \ninformation and without adequate deliberation.” For that ipse dixit they cite no legal authority. That \ncomes as no surprise because their verbal effort to collapse the duty to act in good faith into the duty to act \nwith due care, is not unlike putting a rabbit into the proverbial hat and then blaming the trial judge for \nmaking the insertion. \n \n…The precise question is whether the Chancellor’s articulated standard for bad faith corporate fiduciary \nconduct—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious disregard for one’s responsibilities—is legally \ncorrect. In approaching that question, we note that the Chancellor characterized that definition as \n“anappropriate (although not the only) standard for determining whether fiduciaries have acted in good \nfaith.” That observation is accurate and helpful, because as a matter of simple logic, at least three different \ncategories of fiduciary behavior are candidates for the “bad faith” pejorative label. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n705 \nThe first category involves so-called “subjective bad faith,” that is, fiduciary conduct motivated by an \nactual intent to do harm. That such conduct constitutes classic, quintessential bad faith is a proposition so \nwell accepted in the liturgy of fiduciary law that it borders on axiomatic.…The second category of conduct, \nwhich is at the opposite end of the spectrum, involves lack of due care—that is, fiduciary action taken \nsolely by reason of gross negligence and without any malevolent intent. In this case, appellants assert \nclaims of gross negligence to establish breaches not only of director due care but also of the directors’ duty \nto act in good faith. Although the Chancellor found, and we agree, that the appellants failed to establish \ngross negligence, to afford guidance we address the issue of whether gross negligence (including a failure \nto inform one’s self of available material facts), without more, can also constitute bad faith. The answer is \nclearly no. \n \n…”issues of good faith are (to a certain degree) inseparably and necessarily intertwined with the duties of \ncare and loyalty.…” But, in the pragmatic, conduct-regulating legal realm which calls for more precise \nconceptual line drawing, the answer is that grossly negligent conduct, without more, does not and cannot \nconstitute a breach of the fiduciary duty to act in good faith. The conduct that is the subject of due care \nmay overlap with the conduct that comes within the rubric of good faith in a psychological sense, but from \na legal standpoint those duties are and must remain quite distinct.… \n \nThe Delaware General Assembly has addressed the distinction between bad faith and a failure to exercise \ndue care (i.e., gross negligence) in two separate contexts.

The first is Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, which \nauthorizes Delaware corporations, by a provision in the certificate of incorporation, to exculpate their \ndirectors from monetary damage liability for a breach of the duty of care. That exculpatory provision \naffords significant protection to directors of Delaware corporations. The statute carves out several \nexceptions, however, including most relevantly, “for acts or omissions not in good faith.…” Thus, a \ncorporation can exculpate its directors from monetary liability for a breach of the duty of care, but not for \nconduct that is not in good faith. To adopt a definition of bad faith that would cause a violation of the duty \nof care automatically to become an act or omission “not in good faith,” would eviscerate the protections \naccorded to directors by the General Assembly’s adoption of Section 102(b)(7). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n706 \nA second legislative recognition of the distinction between fiduciary conduct that is grossly negligent and \nconduct that is not in good faith, is Delaware’s indemnification statute, found at 8 Del. C. § 145. To \noversimplify, subsections (a) and (b) of that statute permit a corporation to indemnify (inter alia) any \nperson who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation against expenses…where \n(among other things): (i) that person is, was, or is threatened to be made a party to that action, suit or \nproceeding, and (ii) that person “acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be \nin or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.…” Thus, under Delaware statutory law a \ndirector or officer of a corporation can be indemnified for liability (and litigation expenses) incurred by \nreason of a violation of the duty of care, but not for a violation of the duty to act in good faith. \n \nSection 145, like Section 102(b)(7), evidences the intent of the Delaware General Assembly to afford \nsignificant protections to directors (and, in the case of Section 145, other fiduciaries) of Delaware \ncorporations. To adopt a definition that conflates the duty of care with the duty to act in good faith by \nmaking a violation of the former an automatic violation of the latter, would nullify those legislative \nprotections and defeat the General Assembly’s intent. There is no basis in policy, precedent or common \nsense that would justify dismantling the distinction between gross negligence and bad faith. \n \nThat leaves the third category of fiduciary conduct, which falls in between the first two categories of (1) \nconduct motivated by subjective bad intent and (2) conduct resulting from gross negligence. This third \ncategory is what the Chancellor’s definition of bad faith—intentional dereliction of duty, a conscious \ndisregard for one’s responsibilities—is intended to capture. The question is whether such misconduct is \nproperly treated as a non-exculpable, non-indemnifiable violation of the fiduciary duty to act in good \nfaith. In our view it must be, for at least two reasons. \n \nFirst, the universe of fiduciary misconduct is not limited to either disloyalty in the classic sense (i.e., \npreferring the adverse self-interest of the fiduciary or of a related person to the interest of the \ncorporation) or gross negligence. Cases have arisen where corporate directors have no conflicting self-\ninterest in a decision, yet engage in misconduct that is more culpable than simple inattention or failure to \nbe informed of all facts material to the decision. To protect the interests of the corporation and its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n707 \nshareholders, fiduciary conduct of this kind, which does not involve disloyalty (as traditionally defined) \nbut is qualitatively more culpable than gross negligence, should be proscribed. A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

Section 2(10) of the act defines prospectus as any “notice, circular, advertisement, \nletter, or communication, written or by radio or television, which offers any security for sale or confirms \nthe sale of any security.” (An exception: brief notes advising the public of the availability of the formal \nprospectus.) The import of this definition is that any communication to the public about the offering of a \nsecurity is unlawful unless it contains the requisite information. \n \nThe SEC staff examines the registration statement and prospectus, and if they appear to be materially \nincomplete or inaccurate, the commission may suspend or refuse the effectiveness of the registration \nstatement until the deficiencies are corrected. Even after the securities have gone on sale, the agency has \nthe power to issue a stop order that halts trading in the stock. \n \nSection 5(c) of the act bars any person from making any sale of any security unless it is first registered. \nNevertheless, there are certain classes of exemptions from the registration requirement. Perhaps the most \nimportant of these is Section 4(3), which exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, \nunderwriter or dealer.” Section 4(3) also exempts most transactions of dealers. So the net is that trading \nin outstanding securities (the secondary market) is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of \n1933: you need not file a registration statement with the SEC every time you buy or sell securities through \na broker or dealer, for example. Other exemptions include the following: (1) private offerings to a limited \nnumber of persons or institutions who have access to the kind of information registration would disclose",

Today, every state has enacted a blue sky law, so called because its purpose is to \nprevent “speculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of ‘blue sky.’” [3] The federal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n722 \nSecurities Act of 1933, discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\", specifically preserves the \njurisdiction of states over securities. \nBlue sky laws are divided into three basic types of regulation. The simplest is that which prohibits fraud in \nthe sale of securities. Thus at a minimum, issuers cannot mislead investors about the purpose of the \ninvestment. All blue sky laws have antifraud provisions; some have no other provisions. The second type \ncalls for registration of broker-dealers, and the third type for registration of securities. Some state laws \nparallel the federal laws in intent and form of proceeding, so that they overlap; other blue sky laws \nempower state officials (unlike the SEC) to judge the merits of the offerings, often referred to as \nmerit review laws. As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices.

Understand the liability for insider trading for corporate insiders, “tippees,” and secondary actors under \nSections 16(b) and 10(b) of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. \n3. Recognize how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has amended the 1934 act to increase corporate regulation, \ntransparency, and penalties. \n \n \nCorporations may be found liable if they engage in certain unlawful practices, several of which we explore \nin this section. \n \nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nInvestigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Watergate Special Prosecutor in \nthe early 1970s turned up evidence that hundreds of companies had misused corporate funds, mainly by \nbribing foreign officials to induce them to enter into contracts with or grant licenses to US companies. \nBecause revealing the bribes would normally be self-defeating and, in any event, could be expected to stir \nup immense criticism, companies paying bribes routinely hid the payments in various accounts. As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country. More important than the foreign-bribe provisions, the \nact includes accounting provisions, which broaden considerably the authority of the SEC. These \nprovisions are discussed in SEC v.

Learning bad news (such as financial \nloss or cancellation of key contracts) in advance of all other stockholders will permit the privileged few to \nsell shares before the price falls. Conversely, discovering good news (a major oil find or unexpected \nprofits) in advance gives the insider a decided incentive to purchase shares before the price rises. \nBecause of the unfairness to those who are ignorant of inside information, federal law \nprohibits insider trading. Two provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act are \nparamount: Section 16(b) and 10(b). \n \nRecapture of Short-Swing Profits: Section 16(b) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n726 \nThe Securities Exchange Act assumes that any director, officer, or shareholder owning 10 percent or more \nof the stock in a corporation is using inside information if he or any family member makes a profit from \ntrading activities, either buying and selling or selling and buying, during a six-month period. Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized \non the sale less the $3,000 cost of the purchase). \n \nAs a consequence of Section 16(b) and certain other provisions, trading in securities by directors, officers, \nand large stockholders presents numerous complexities. For instance, the law requires people in this \nposition to make periodic reports to the SEC about their trades. As a practical matter, directors, officers, \nand large shareholders should not trade in their own company stock in the short run without legal advice. \n \nInsider Trading: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits any person from using the mails or \nfacilities of interstate commerce “to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \nsecurity…any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and \nregulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the \nprotection of investors.” In 1942, the SEC learned of a company president who misrepresented the \ncompany’s financial condition in order to buy shares at a low price from current stockholders. So the \ncommission adopted a rule under the authority of Section 10(b). Rule 10b-5, as it was dubbed, has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n727 \nremained unchanged for more than forty years and has spawned thousands of lawsuits and SEC \nproceedings. It reads as follows: \n \nIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or \ninstrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national \nsecurities exchange, \n \n(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, \n(2) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary \nin order to make the statements made, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, \nnot misleading, or \n(3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a \nfraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. \n \nRule 10b-5 applies to any person who purchases or sells any security.

In substance, it is an \nantifraud rule, enforcement of which seems, on its face, to be limited to action by the SEC. But over the \nyears, the courts have permitted people injured by those who violate the statute to file private damage \nsuits. This sweeping rule has at times been referred to as the “federal law of corporations” or the “catch \neverybody” rule. \n \nInsider trading ran headlong into Rule 10b-5 beginning in 1964 in a series of cases involving Texas Gulf \nSulphur Company (TGS). On November 12, 1963, the company discovered a rich deposit of copper and \nzinc while drilling for oil near Timmins, Ontario. Keeping the discovery quiet, it proceeded to acquire \nmineral rights in adjacent lands. By April 1964, word began to circulate about TGS’s find. \n \nNewspapers printed rumors, and the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a wild speculative spree. On \nApril 12, an executive vice president of TGS issued a press release downplaying the discovery, asserting \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n728 \nthat the rumors greatly exaggerated the find and stating that more drilling would be necessary before \ncoming to any conclusions. Four days later, on April 16, TGS publicly announced that it had uncovered a \nstrike of 25 million tons of ore. In the months following this announcement, TGS stock doubled in value. \n \nThe SEC charged several TGS officers and directors with having purchased or told their friends, so-\ncalled tippees, to purchase TGS stock from November 12, 1963, through April 16, 1964, on the basis of \nmaterial inside information. The SEC also alleged that the April 12, 1964, press release was deceptive. The \nUS Court of Appeals, in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., [2] decided that the defendants who purchased the \nstock before the public announcement had violated Rule 10b-5. According to the court, “anyone in \npossession of material inside information must either disclose it to the investing public, or, if he is \ndisabled from disclosing to protect a corporate confidence, or he chooses not to do so, must abstain from \ntrading in or recommending the securities concerned while such inside information remains undisclosed.” \nOn remand, the district court ordered certain defendants to pay $148,000 into an escrow account to be \nused to compensate parties injured by the insider trading. \n \nThe court of appeals also concluded that the press release violated Rule 10b-5 if “misleading to the \nreasonable investor.” On remand, the district court held that TGS failed to exercise “due diligence” in \nissuing the release. Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions. [4] \n \nThe Supreme Court has placed limitations on the liability of tippees under Rule 10b-5. In 1980, the Court \nreversed the conviction of an employee of a company that printed tender offer and merger prospectuses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n729 \nUsing information obtained at work, the employee had purchased stock in target companies and later sold \nit for a profit when takeover attempts were publicly announced. In Chiarella v. United States, the Court \nheld that the employee was not an insider or a fiduciary and that “a duty to disclose under Section 10(b) \ndoes not arise from the mere possession of nonpublic market information.” [5] Following Chiarella, the \nCourt ruled in Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v.

This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2. Under this new rule, the duty of trust or confidence exists when (1) a person agrees to \nmaintain information in confidence; (2) the recipient knows or should have known through history, \npattern, or practice of sharing confidences that the person communicating the information expects \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n730 \nconfidentiality; and (3) a person received material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, \nchild, or sibling. \n \nIn 1987, in Carpenter v. United States, [8] the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Wall Street \nJournal reporter who leaked advanced information about the contents of his “Heard on the Street” \ncolumn. The reporter, who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, had been convicted on both mail \nand wire fraud and securities law charges for misappropriating information. The Court upheld the mail \nand wire fraud conviction by an 8–0 vote and the securities law conviction by a 4–4 vote. (In effect, the tie \nvote affirmed the conviction.) [9] \n \nBeyond these judge-made theories of liability, Congress had been concerned about insider trading, and in \n1984 and 1988, it substantially increased the penalties. A person convicted of insider trading now faces a \nmaximum criminal fine of $1 million and a possible ten-year prison term. A civil penalty of up to three \ntimes the profit made (or loss avoided) by insider trading can also be imposed. This penalty is in addition \nto liability for profits made through insider trading. For example, financier Ivan Boesky, who was \nsentenced in 1987 to a three-year prison term for insider trading, was required to disgorge $50 million of \nprofits and was liable for another $50 million as a civil penalty. In 2003, Martha Stewart was indicted on \ncharges of insider trading but was convicted for obstruction of justice, serving only five months. More \nrecently, in 2009, billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, Raj Rajaratnam, was arrested for insider \ntrading; he was convicted in May 2011 of all 14 counts of insider trading. For the SEC release on the \nMartha Stewart case, seehttp://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm. \n \nCompanies that knowingly and recklessly fail to prevent insider trading by their employees are subject to \na civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided by insider trading or $1 million, \nwhichever is greater. Corporations are also subject to a criminal fine of up to $2.5 million. \n \nSecondary Actor \nIn Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, [10] the US Supreme Court held that “aiders and \nabettors” of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under 10(b) for a private cause of action. This means \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n731 \nthat secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, cannot be held liable unless their conduct \nsatisfies all the elements for 10(b) liability. \nFor an overview of insider trading, go to http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm.",

The Court also explicitly has defined a standard of materiality under the securities \nlaws, see TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d, at 849. \n \n* * * \n \nWhether merger discussions in any particular case are material therefore depends on the facts. Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action.

How does the court determine what is or is not material information? How does this differ from its previous \nrulings? \n2. What is the fraud-on-the-market theory? \n \n \n \n17.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond state corporation laws, federal statutes—most importantly, the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934—regulate the issuance and trading of corporate securities. The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock. Under Rule 10b-5, the SEC and private parties may sue \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n742 \ninsiders who traded on information not available to the general public, thus gaining an advantage in \neither selling or buying the stock. Insiders include company employees. \n \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended the 1934 act, creating more stringent penalties, increasing corporate \nregulation, and requiring greater transparency. \n \nEXERCISES",

(When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such. [1] \n \nFigure 18.1 Purchase of Assets \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n748 \n \n \nSuccessor Liability \nOne of the principal advantages of this method of expansion is that the acquiring company generally is not \nliable for the debts and/or lawsuits of the corporation whose assets it purchased, generally known \nas successor liability. Suppose BCT paid Flying Truckman $250,000 for its trucks, routes, and name. \nWith that cash, Flying Truckman paid off several of its creditors. Its shareholders then voted to dissolve \nthe corporation, leaving one creditor unsatisfied. The creditor can no longer sue Flying Truckman since it \ndoes not exist. So he sues BCT. Unless certain circumstances exist, as discussed in Ray v. Alad \nCorporation (see Section 18.4.1 \"Successor Liability\"), BCT is not liable for Flying Truckman’s debts. \n \nSeveral states, although not a majority, have adopted the Ray product-line exception approach to \nsuccessor liability. The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability. Other jurisdictions also permit a continuity-of-\nenterprise exception, whereby the court examines how closely the acquiring corporation’s business is to \nthe acquired corporation’s business (e.g., see Turner v. Bituminous Casualty Co.).[2] \n \nMerger \nWhen the assets of a company are purchased, the selling company itself may or may not go out of \nexistence. By contrast, in a merger, the acquired company goes out of existence by being absorbed into the \nacquiring company. In the example in Section 18.1.2 \"Merger\", Flying Truck would merge into BCT, \nresulting in Flying Truckman losing its existence. The acquiring company receives all of the acquired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n749 \ncompany’s assets, including physical property and intangible property such as contracts and goodwill. The \nacquiring company also assumes all debts of the acquired company. \n \nA merger begins when two or more corporations negotiate an agreement outlining the specifics of a \nmerger, such as which corporation survives and the identities of management personnel. There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash. These shareholders retain no interest in the \nsurviving corporation, having been bought out. This is often called a freeze-out merger, since the \nshareholders of the disappearing corporation are frozen out of an interest in the surviving corporation. \n \nIn a noncash merger, the shareholders of the disappearing corporation retain an interest in the surviving \ncorporation. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade their shares for shares in the \nsurviving corporation; thus they retain an interest in the surviving corporation when they become \nshareholders of that surviving corporation. \n \nUnless the articles of incorporation state otherwise, majority approval of the merger by both boards of \ndirectors and both sets of shareholders is necessary (see Figure 18.2 \"Merger\"). The shareholder majority \nmust be of the total shares eligible to vote, not merely of the total actually represented at the special \nmeeting called for the purpose of determining whether to merge. \n \nFigure 18.2 Merger \n \n \nConsolidation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n750 \nConsolidation is virtually the same as a merger. The companies merge, but the resulting entity is a new \ncorporation. Returning to our previous example, BCT and Flying Truckman could consolidate and form a \nnew corporation. As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days. The Williams Act, which made certain amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, can be viewed at http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/. The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

The first involves the purchase of assets not in the \nordinary course of business. Using this method, the purchase expands the corporation. The second and third \nmethods, merger and consolidation, are very similar: two or more corporations combine. In a merger, one of \nthe merging companies survives, and the other ceases to exist. In a consolidation, the merging corporations \ncease to exist when they combine to form a new corporation. The final method is a stock purchase, \naccomplished via a tender offer, takeover, or leveraged buyout. Federal and state regulations play a significant \nrole in takeovers and tender offers, particularly the Williams Act. A shareholder who does not wish to \nparticipate in a stock sale may invoke his appraisal rights and demand cash compensation for his shares. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

                    "question": "What are some dangers in purchasing the assets of another corporation?",
                    "answer": "When a corporation purchases the assets of another corporation, it is not purchasing the liabilities of the other corporation. This can be a danger because the corporation may not be aware of the liabilities of the other corporation. For example, the corporation may not be aware of any lawsuits that the other corporation is involved in. This can lead to the corporation being held liable for the other corporation's debts. Another danger is that the corporation may not be able to get the same tax benefits as the other corporation. This is because the corporation is not purchasing the other corporation's assets, but rather the assets of the other corporation's shareholders. This can lead to the corporation being taxed at a higher rate than the other corporation. Finally, the corporation may not be able to get the same insurance coverage as the other corporation. This is because the corporation is not purchasing the other corporation's assets, but rather the assets of the other corporation's shareholders. This can lead to the corporation being uninsured for certain risks."

The Williams Act requires that a company's board of directors approve any takeover offer before it can be made public. State antitakeover statutes vary, but they generally require that a company's board of directors approve any takeover offer before it can be made public. The rationales behind these statutes are to protect shareholders from being taken advantage of by hostile takeovers. Hostile takeovers can be very disruptive to a company, and they can also lead to a loss of shareholder value. By requiring that a company's board of directors approve any takeover offer before it can be made public, these statutes help to ensure that shareholders are not taken advantage of."

[2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state.

This provision is obviously applicable primarily to closely held corporations. \nDissolution can also be accomplished even if some shareholders dissent. The directors must first adopt a \nresolution by majority vote recommending the dissolution. The shareholders must then have an \nopportunity to vote on the resolution at a meeting after being notified of its purpose. A majority of the \noutstanding voting shares is necessary to carry the resolution. Although this procedure is most often used \nwhen a company has been inactive, nothing bars its use by large corporations. In 1979, UV Industries, \n357th on the Fortune 500 list, with profits of $40 million annually, voted to dissolve and to distribute \nsome $500 million to its stockholders, in part as a means of fending off a hostile takeover. Fortune \nmagazine referred to it as “a company that’s worth more dead than alive.” [2] \n \nOnce dissolution has been approved, the corporation may dissolve by filing a certificate or articles of \ndissolution with the secretary of state. The certificate may be filed as the corporation begins to wind up its \naffairs or at any time thereafter. The process of winding up is liquidation. The company must notify all \ncreditors of its intention to liquidate. It must collect and dispose of its assets, discharge all obligations, \nand distribute any remainder to its stockholders. \n \nInvoluntary Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n761 \nIn certain cases, a corporation can face involuntary dissolution. A state may bring an action to \ndissolve a corporation on one of five grounds: failure to file an annual report or pay taxes, fraud in \nprocuring incorporation, exceeding or abusing authority conferred, failure for thirty days to appoint and \nmaintain a registered agent, and failure to notify the state of a change of registered office or agent. State-\nspecific differences exist as well. Delaware permits its attorney general to involuntarily dissolve a \ncorporation for abuse, misuse, or nonuse of corporate powers, privileges, or franchise. [3] California, on the \nother hand, permits involuntary dissolution for abandonment of a business, board deadlocks, internal \nstrife and deadlocked shareholders, mismanagement, fraud or abuse of authority, expiration of term of \ncorporation, or protection of a complaining shareholder if there are fewer than thirty-five \nshareholders. [4]California permits the initiation of involuntary dissolution by either half of the directors in \noffice or by a third of shareholders. \n \nJudicial Liquidation \nAction by Shareholder \nA shareholder may file suit to have a court dissolve the company on a showing that the company is being \nirreparably injured because the directors are deadlocked in the management of corporate affairs and the \nshareholders cannot break the deadlock. Shareholders may also sue for liquidation if corporate assets are \nbeing misapplied or wasted, or if directors or those in control are acting illegally, oppressively, or \nfraudulently. \n \nClaims against a Dissolved Corporation \nUnder Sections 14.06 and 14.07 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, a dissolved corporation \nmust provide written notice of the dissolution to its creditors. The notice must state a deadline, which \nmust be at least 120 days after the notice, for receipt of creditors’ claims. Claims not received by the \ndeadline are barred. The corporation may also publish a notice of the dissolution in a local newspaper. \nCreditors who do not receive written notice or whose claim is not acted on have five years to file suit \nagainst the corporation. If the corporate assets have been distributed, shareholders are personally liable, \nalthough the liability may not exceed the assets received at liquidation. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n762 \nBankruptcy \nAs an alternative to dissolution, a corporation in financial trouble may look to federal bankruptcy law for \nrelief. A corporation may use liquidation proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act or \nmay be reorganized under Chapter 11 of the act.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution. Hence the acquisition of Alad I’s assets was not in the nature of a merger or",

There are several generally recognized exceptions, such as when \nthe asset purchase is fraudulent or to avoid creditors. Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business. The \nacquiring corporation assumes the other company’s debts. Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There \nare two main types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. A consolidation is virtually the same \nas a merger, except that the resulting entity is a new corporation. \n \nA corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly \nreferred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using \nthe target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target. \nA shareholder has the right to fair value for his stock if he dissents from a plan to merge, consolidate, or \nsell all or substantially all of the corporate assets, referred to as appraisal rights. If there is disagreement \nover the value, the shareholder has the right to a court appraisal. When one company acquires 90 percent \nof the stock of another, it may merge with the target through a short-form merger, which eliminates the \nrequirement of consent of shareholders and the target company’s board. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n771 \nCertain federal regulations are implicated in corporate expansion, particularly the Williams Act. States \nmay impose conditions on admission of a foreign corporation to do business of a purely local nature but \nnot if its business is exclusively interstate in character, which would violate the Commerce Clause. Among \nthe requirements are obtaining a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and maintaining a \nregistered office with a registered agent. But certain activities do not constitute doing business, such as \nfiling lawsuits and collecting debts, and may be carried on even if the corporation is not licensed to do \nbusiness in a state. Under long-arm statutes, state courts have jurisdiction over foreign corporations as \nlong as the corporations have minimum contacts in the state. States may also tax corporate activities as \nlong as the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce. \n \nDissolution is the legal termination of a corporation’s existence, as distinguished from liquidation, the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. A corporation may be dissolved by shareholders if they \nunanimously agree in writing, or by majority vote of the directors and shareholders. A corporation may \nalso be dissolved involuntarily on one of five grounds, including failure to file an annual report or to pay \ntaxes. Shareholders may sue for judicial liquidation on a showing that corporate assets are being wasted \nor directors or officers are acting illegally or fraudulently. \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Negotiability means that the paper is freely and unconditionally transferable from one \nperson to another by delivery or by delivery and indorsement. (“Indorsement,” not “endorsement,” is the \nspelling used in the UCC, though the latter is more common in nonlegal usage.) Without the ability to pay \nand finance through commercial paper, the business world would be paralyzed. At bottom, negotiability is \nthe means by which a person is empowered to transfer to another more than what the transferor himself \npossesses. In essence, this is the power to convey to a transferee the right in turn to convey clear title, \nwhen the original transferor does not have clear title. \n \nOverview of Chapters on Commercial Paper \nIn this chapter, we examine the history and nature of commercial paper and define the types of parties \n(persons who have an interest in the paper) and the types of instruments. We then proceed to four \nfundamental issues that must be addressed to determine whether parties such as First Bank, in the \npreceding example, can collect: \n1. Is the paper negotiable? That is, is the paper in the proper form? We explore that issue in this \nchapter. \n2. Was the paper negotiated properly? See Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n778 \n3. Is the purchaser of the paper a holder in due course? See Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and \nDefenses\". \n4. Does the maker of the paper have available any defenses against even the holder in due course? \nSee Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \nIn most transactions, especially when the first three questions are answered affirmatively, the purchaser \nwill have little trouble collecting. But when the purchaser is unable to collect, questions of liability arise. \nThese questions, along with termination of liability, are discussed in Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\". \n \nFinally, in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\" we examine other legal aspects of banking, including \nletters of credit and electronic funds transfer. \n \nHistory of Commercial Paper \nDevelopment of the Law \nNegotiable instruments are no modern invention; we know that merchants used them as long ago as the \nage of Hammurabi, around 1700 BC. They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement).

The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption. This preemption could take \ntwo major forms. First, the Federal Reserve Board governs the activities of Federal Reserve Banks. As a \nresult, Federal Reserve regulations provide important guidelines for the check collection process. Second, \nArticle 3 of the UCC can be preempted by federal statutes. An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

The key to the success of this invention is the concept of negotiability: through \nthis process, a person can pass on—in most cases—better title to receive payment than he had; thus the \ntransferee of such paper will most likely get paid by the obligor and will not be subject to most defenses of \nany prior holders. The law of commercial paper has developed over the past four hundred years. It is now the \nUniform Commercial Code that governs most commercial paper transactions in the United States, but federal \nor international preemption is possible in the future. Commercial paper is important in both economics and \nfinance. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If there were no such thing as commercial paper, real or virtual (electronic funds transfers), how would you \npay your bills? How did merchants have to pay their bills four hundred years ago? \n2. What is it about negotiability that it is the key to the success of commercial paper? \n3. How could state law—the UCC—be preempted in regard to commercial paper? \n \n \n \n19.2 Scope of Article 3 and Types of Commercial Paper and \nParties \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n782 \n1. Understand the scope of Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Recognize the types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n3. Give the names of the various parties to commercial paper. \n \n \nScope of Article 3 \nArticle 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) covers commercial paper but explicitly excludes money, \ndocuments of title, and investment securities. Documents of title include bills of lading and warehouse \nreceipts and are governed by Article 7 of the UCC. Investment securities are covered by Article 8. \nInstruments that fall within the scope of Article 3 may also be subject to Article 4 (bank deposits and \ncollections), Article 8 (securities), and Article 9 (secured transactions). If so, the rules of these other \narticles supersede the provisions of Article 3 to the extent of conflict. Article 3 is a set of general provisions \non negotiability; the other articles deal more narrowly with specific transactions or instruments. \n \nTypes of Commercial Paper \nThere are four types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n \n \nDrafts \nA draft is an unconditional written order by one person (the drawer) directing another person (the \ndrawee) to pay a certain sum of money on demand or at a definite time to a named third person (the \npayee) or to bearer. The draft is one of the two basic types of commercial paper; the other is the note. As \nindicated by its definition, the draft is a three-party transaction. \n \nParties to a Draft \nThe drawer is one who directs a person or an entity, usually a bank, to pay a sum of money stated in an \ninstrument—for example, a person who makes a draft or writes a check. The drawer prepares a document \n(a form, usually)—the draft—ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee. The \ndrawee is the person or entity that a draft is directed to and that is ordered to pay the amount stated on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n783 \nit. The most common drawee is a bank. The drawer, drawee, and payee need not be different people; the \nsame person may have different capacities in a single transaction. For example, a drawer (the person \nasking that payment be made) may also be the payee (the person to whom the payment is to be made). A \ndrawee who signs the draft becomes an acceptor: the drawee pledges to honor the draft as written. To \naccept, the drawee need only sign her name on the draft, usually vertically on the face, but anywhere will \ndo. Words such as “accepted” or “good” are unnecessary. However, a drawee who indicates that she might \nrefuse to pay will not be held to have accepted. Thus in the archetypal case, the court held that a drawee \nwho signed his name and appended the words “Kiss my foot” did not accept the draft. [1] \n \nThe drawer directs the funds to be drawn from—pulled from—the drawee, and the drawee pays the person",

Recall from Section 19.1 \n\"Introduction to Commercial Paper\" that Lorna Love wished to buy tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc. \nSuppose Love had the money to pay but did not want to do so before delivery. Rackets, on the other hand, \ndid not want to ship before Love paid. The solution: a sight draft, drawn on Love, to which would be \nattached an order bill of lading that Rackets received from the trucker when it shipped the rackets. The \nsight draft and bill of lading go to a bank in Love’s city. When the tennis rackets arrive, the carrier notifies \nthe bank, which presents the draft to Love for payment. When she has done so, the bank gives Love the \nbill of lading, entitling her to receive the shipment. The bank forwards the payment to Rackets’ bank, \nwhich credits Rackets’ account with the purchase amount. \n \nA time draft, not surprisingly, calls for payment on a date specified in the draft. Suppose that Love will \nnot have sufficient cash to pay until she has sold the rackets but that Rackets needs to be paid \nimmediately. The solution: a common form of time draft known as a trade acceptance. Rackets, the seller, \ndraws a draft on Love, who thus becomes a drawee. The draft orders Love to pay the purchase price to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n784 \norder of Rackets, as payee, on a fixed date. Rackets presents the draft to Love, who accepts it by signing \nher name. Rackets then can indorse the draft (by signing it) and sell it, at a discount, to its bank or some \nother financial institution. Rackets thus gets its money right away; the bank may collect from Love on the \ndate specified. See the example of a time draft in Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.3 A Time Draft \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n785 \nDrafts in International Trade \nDrafts are an international convention. In England and the British Commonwealth, drafts are called bills \nof exchange. Like a draft, a bill of exchange is a kind of check or promissory note without interest. Used \nprimarily in international trade, it is a written order by one person to pay another a specific sum on a \nspecific date sometime in the future. If the bill of exchange is drawn on a bank, it is called a bank draft. If \nit is drawn on another party, it is called a trade draft. Sometimes a bill of exchange will simply be called a \ndraft, but whereas a draft is always negotiable (transferable by endorsement), this is not necessarily true \nof a bill of exchange. \n \nA widely used draft in international trade is the banker’s acceptance. It is a short-term credit \ninvestment created by a nonfinancial firm and guaranteed by a bank. This instrument is used when an \nexporter agrees to extend credit to an importer. \n \nAssume Love, the importer, is in New York; Rackets, the exporter, is in Taiwan. Rackets is willing to \npermit Love to pay ninety days after shipment. Love makes a deal with her New York bank to issue \nRackets’ bank in Taiwan a letter of credit. This tells the seller’s bank that the buyer’s bank is willing to \naccept a draft drawn on the buyer in accordance with terms spelled out in the letter of credit. Love’s bank \nmay insist on a security interest in the tennis rackets, or it may conclude that Love is creditworthy. On \nreceipt of the letter of credit, Rackets presents its bank in Taiwan with a draft drawn on Love’s bank. That \nbank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786",

Of course, there is a danger in using pencil or an ink that can be erased, since the \ndrawer might be liable for alterations. For example, if you write out in pencil a check for $10 and someone \nerases your figures and writes in $250, you may lose your right to protest when the bank cashes it. \n \nSigned by the Maker or Drawer \nSignature is not limited to the personal handwriting of one’s name. “Any symbol executed or adopted by a \nparty with present intention to authenticate a writing” will serve. [1] That means that a maker or drawer \nmay make an impression of his signature with a rubber stamp or even an X if he intends that by so doing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n791 \nhe has signed. It can be typed or by thumbprint. In some cases, an appropriate letterhead may serve to \nmake the note or draft negotiable without any other signature. Nor does the position of the signature \nmatter. Blackstone Kent’s handwritten note, “Ten days from this note, I, Blackstone Kent, promise to pay \n$5,000 to the order of Webster Mews,” is sufficient to make the note negotiable, even though there is no \nsubsequent signature. Moreover, the signature may be in a trade name or an assumed name. (Note: \nspecial problems arise when an agent signs on behalf of a principal. We consider these problems \nin Chapter 22 \"Liability and Discharge\".) \n \nUnconditional Promise or Order to Pay \nSection 3-106(a) of the UCC provides that an instrument is not negotiable if it “states (i) an express \ncondition to payment, (ii) that the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing, or (iii) \nthat rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing. A reference to \nanother writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.” Under 3-106(b), a promise is \nnot made conditional by “(i) reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to \ncollateral, pre-payment, or acceleration, or (ii) because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or \nsource.” As to “reference to another writing,” see Holly Hill Acres, Ltd. v. Charter Bank of Gainesville, \nin Section 19.4 \"Cases\". \n \nThe only permissible promise or order in a negotiable instrument is to pay a sum certain in money. Any \nother promise or order negates negotiability. The reason for this rule is to prevent an instrument from \nhaving an indeterminate value. The usefulness of a negotiable instrument as a substitute for money would \nbe seriously eroded if the instrument’s holder had to investigate whether a stipulation or condition had \nbeen met before the thing had any value (i.e., before the obligor’s obligation to pay ripened). \n \nFixed Amount in Money \nThe value of the paper must be fixed (specific) so it can be ascertained, and it must be payable in money. \n \nFixed Amount \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n792 \nThe instrument must recite an exact amount of money that is to be paid, although the exact amount need \nnot be expressed in a single figure. For example, the note can state that the principal is $1,000 and the \ninterest is 11.5 percent, without specifying the total amount. Or the note could state the amount in \ninstallments: twelve equal installments of $88.25. Or it could state different interest rates before and after \na certain date or depending on whether or not the maker has defaulted; it could be determinable by a \nformula or by reference to a source described in the instrument. [2] It could permit the maker to take a \ndiscount if he pays before a certain date or could assess a penalty if he pays after the date. It could also \nprovide for an attorney’s fees and the costs of collection on default. If it is clear that interest is to be \nincluded but no interest amount is set, UCC Section 3-112 provides that it is “payable at the judgment rate \nin effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.” The fundamental \nrule is that for any time of payment, the holder must be able to determine, after the appropriate \ncalculations, the amount then payable. See Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Centerre Bank of Branson v. Campbell, \nfor a case involving the “fixed amount” rule. \n \nIn Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which",

Pertinent to the issues on \nthis appeal, Centerre’s petition averred: \n \n“1. …on [May 7,] 1985, the [Campbells] made and delivered to Strand…their promissory note…and \nthereby promised to pay to Strand…or its order…($11,250.00) with interest thereon from date at the rate \nof fourteen percent (14%) per annum; that a copy of said promissory note is attached hereto…and \nincorporated herein by reference. \n \n2. That thereafter and before maturity, said note was assigned and delivered by Strand…to [Centerre] for \nvaluable consideration and [Centerre] is the owner and holder of said promissory note.” \n \nCenterre’s petition went on to allege that default had been made in payment of the note and that there was \nan unpaid principal balance of $9,000, plus accrued interest, due thereon. Centerre’s petition prayed for \njudgment against the Campbells for the unpaid principal and interest. \n \n[The Campbells] aver that the note was given for the purchase of an interest in a limited partnership to be \ncreated by Strand, that no limited partnership was thereafter created by Strand, and that by reason \nthereof there was “a complete and total failure of consideration for the said promissory note.” \nConsequently, pled the answers, Centerre “should be estopped from asserting a claim against [the \nCampbells] on said promissory note because of such total failure of consideration for same.” \n \nThe cause was tried to the court, all parties having waived trial by jury. At trial, the attorney for the \nCampbells asked Curtis D. Campbell what the consideration was for the note. Centerre’s attorney \ninterrupted: “We object to any testimony as to the consideration for the note because it’s our position that \nis not a defense in this lawsuit since the bank is the holder in due course.”… \n \n \nThe trial court entered judgment in favor of Centerre and against the Campbells for $9,000, plus accrued \ninterest and costs. The trial court filed no findings of fact or conclusions of law, none having been \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n801 \nrequested. The trial court did, however, include in its judgment a finding that Centerre “is a holder in due \ncourse of the promissory note sued upon.” \n \nThe Campbells appeal, briefing four points. Their first three, taken together, present a single hypothesis of \nerror consisting of these components: (a) the Campbells showed “by clear and convincing evidence a valid \nand meritorious defense in that there existed a total lack and failure of consideration for the promissory \nnote in question,” (b) Centerre acquired the note subject to such defense in that Centerre was not a holder \nin due course, as one can be a holder in due course of a note only if the note is a negotiable instrument, \nand (c) the note was not a negotiable instrument inasmuch as “it failed to state a sum certain due the \npayee.”… \n \nWe have already noted that if Centerre is not a holder in due course, the Campbells can assert the defense \nof failure of consideration against Centerre to the same degree they could have asserted it against Strand. \nWe have also spelled out that Centerre cannot be a holder in due course if the note is not a negotiable \ninstrument. The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether the provision that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand prevents the note from being a negotiable instrument.… \n \nNeither side has cited a Missouri case applying [UCC 3-104(a)] to a note containing a provision similar to: \n“Interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand.” Our independent research has likewise proven \nfruitless. There are, however, instructive decisions from other jurisdictions. \n \nIn Taylor v. Roeder, [Citation, Virginia] (1987), a note provided for interest at “[t]hree percent (3.00%) \nover Chase Manhattan prime to be adjusted monthly.” A second note provided for interest at “3% over \nChase Manhattan prime adjusted monthly.” Applying sections of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted \nby Virginia identical to [the Missouri UCC], the court held the notes were not negotiable instruments in \nthat the amounts required to satisfy them could not be ascertained without reference to an extrinsic \nsource, the varying prime rate of interest charged by Chase Manhattan Bank. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n802 \nIn Branch Banking and Trust Co. v. Creasy, [Citation, North Carolina] (1980), a guaranty agreement \nprovided that the aggregate amount of principal of all indebtedness and liabilities at any one time for \nwhich the guarantor would be liable shall not exceed $35,000. The court, emphasizing that to be a \nnegotiable instrument a writing must contain, among other things, an unconditional promise to pay a sum \ncertain in money, held the agreement was not a negotiable instrument. The opinion recited that for the \nrequirement of a sum certain to be met, it is necessary that at the time of payment the holder be able to",

Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts. \nSometimes mail goes astray or gets stolen. Surely it must be permissible for the customer to safeguard the \ncheck by restricting its use to depositing it in her account. A collection indorsement, such as “For \ndeposit” or “For collection,” is effective. Section 3-206(c) of the UCC provides that anybody other than a \nbank who purchases the instrument with such an indorsement converts the instrument—effectively steals \nit. A depositary bank that takes it must deposit it as directed, or the bank has converted it. A payor bank \nthat is also the depositary bank that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter \nconverts it: the check cannot be cashed; it must be deposited (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\"). \n \nTo illustrate, suppose that Kate Jones indorses her paycheck “For deposit only, Kate Jones,” which is by \nfar the most common type of restrictive indorsement (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", right). A \nthief steals the check, indorses his name below the restrictive indorsement, and deposits the check in Last \nBank, where he has an account, or cashes it. The check moves through the collection process to Second \nBank and then to First Bank, which pays the check. Kate has the right to recover only from Last Bank, \nwhich did not properly honor the indorsement by depositing the payment in her account. \n \nTrust Indorsement \nA second legitimate restrictive indorsement is indorsement in trust, called a \ntrust indorsement (sometimes agency indorsement). Suppose Paul Payee owes Carlene Creditor a \ndebt. Payee indorses a check drawn to him by a third party, “Pay to Tina Attorney in trust for Carlene \nCreditor.” Attorney indorses in blank and delivers it to (a) a holder for value, (b) a depository bank for \ncollection, or (c) a payor bank for payment. In each case, these takers can safely pay Attorney so long as \nthey have no notice under Section 3-307 of the UCC of any breach of fiduciary duty that Attorney may be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n822 \ncommitting. For example, under Section 3-307(b), these takers have notice of a breach of trust if the check \nwas taken in any transaction known by the taker to be for Attorney’s personal benefit. Subsequent \ntransferees of the check from the holder or depositary bank are not affected by the restriction unless they \nhave knowledge that Attorney dealt with the check in breach of trust (adapted from UCC, Section 3-206, \nOfficial Comment 4). (Of course Attorney should not indorse in blank; she should indorse “Tina Attorney, \nin trust for Carlene Creditor” and deposit the check in her trust account.) \n \nThe dichotomy here between restrictive and unrestrictive indorsements is the indorser’s way of showing \nto what use the instrument may be put. \n \nConditional Indorsement \nAn indorser might want to condition the negotiation of an instrument upon some event, such as “Pay \nCarla Green if she finishes painting my house by July 15.” Such a conditional indorsement is generally \nineffective: the UCC, Section 3-206(b), says a person paying for value can disregard the condition without \nliability. \n \nQualified Indorsement \nAn indorser can limit his liability by making a qualified indorsement. The usual qualified indorsement \nconsists of the words “without recourse,” which mean that the indorser has no contract liability to \nsubsequent holders if a maker or drawee defaults. A qualified indorsement does not impair negotiability. \nThe qualification must be in writing by signature on the instrument itself. By disclaiming contract \nliability, the qualified indorser also limits his warranty liabilities, though he does not eliminate them. \nSection 3-415(a) of the UCC narrows the indorser’s warranty that no defense of any party is good against \nthe indorser. In its place, the qualified indorser warrants merely that he has no knowledge of any defense. \n \n“Without recourse” indorsements can have a practical impact on the balance sheet. A company holding a \npromissory note can obtain cash by discounting it—indorsing it over to a bank for maturity value less the \nbank’s discount. As an indorser, however, the company remains liable to pay the amount to subsequent \nholders should the maker default at maturity.

The Federal Reserve \nBoard has recommendations for how instruments should be indorsed to speed machine reading of them. \nIndorsements are either blank or special; they are either restrictive or nonrestrictive; and they are either \nqualified or unqualified. These pairings show the indorser’s intention as to how further negotiation may be \naccomplished, to what uses the instrument may be put, and what liability the indorser is willing to assume. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If an instrument is not indorsed according to Federal Reserve Board standards, is it still valid? \n2. Suppose that Indorsee signs an instrument in blank and drops it. Suppose that the instrument is found by \nFinder and that Finder delivers it to Third Person with the intention to sell it. Is this successful negotiation? \n3. Why would a person make a restrictive indorsement? A qualified indorsement? \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n824 \n20.3 Problems and Issues in Negotiation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize under what circumstances a negotiation is subject to rescission. \n2. Know the effect of reacquisition of an instrument. \n3. Understand how instruments made payable to two or more persons are negotiated. \n4. Understand how the UCC treats forged indorsements, imposters, and other signatures in the name of the \npayee. \n \n \nCommon Issues Arising in Negotiation of Commercial Paper \nA number of problems commonly arise that affect the negotiation of commercial paper. Here we take up \nthree. \n \nNegotiation Subject to Rescission \nA negotiation—again, transfer of possession to a person who becomes a holder—can be effective even \nwhen it is made by a person without the capacity to sign. Section 3-202(a) of the UCC declares that \nnegotiation is effective even when the indorsement is made by an infant or by a corporation exceeding its \npowers; is obtained by fraud, duress, or mistake; is part of an illegal transaction; or is made in breach of a \nduty. \n \nHowever, unless the instrument was negotiated to a holder in due course, the indorsement can be \nrescinded or subjected to another appropriate legal remedy. The Official Comment to this UCC section is \nhelpful: \n \nSubsection (a) applies even though the lack of capacity or the illegality is of a character which \ngoes to the essence of the transaction and makes it entirely void. It is inherent in the character of \nnegotiable instruments that any person in possession of an instrument which by its terms is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n825 \npayable to that person or to bearer is a holder and may be dealt with by anyone as a holder. The \nprinciple finds its most extreme application in the well-settled rule that a holder in due course \nmay take the instrument even from a thief and be protected against the claim of the rightful \nowner. The policy of subsection (a) is that any person to whom an instrument is negotiated is a \nholder until the instrument has been recovered from that person’s possession. [1] \n \nSo suppose a mentally incapacitated person under a guardianship evades her guardian, goes to town, and \nwrites a check for a new car. Normally, contracts made by such persons are void. But the check is \nnegotiable here. If the guardian finds out about the escapade before the check leaves the dealer’s hands, \nthe deal could be rescinded: the check could be retrieved and the car returned. \n \nEffect of Reacquisition \nA prior party who reacquires an instrument may reissue it or negotiate it further. But doing so discharges \nintervening parties as to the reacquirer and to later purchasers who are not holders in due course. Section \n3-207 of the UCC permits the reacquirer to cancel indorsements unnecessary to his title or ownership; in \nso doing, he eliminates the liability of such indorsers even as to holders in due course.",

Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it. And the rationale for \nmaking Lorna Love bear the loss is that she failed to detect the scam: she intended the imposter, Wright, \nto receive the instrument. Section 3-404(c) provides that the indorsement of the imposter (Wright, posing \nas Steve Supplier) is effective. The same rule applies if the imposter poses as an agent: if the check is \npayable to Supplier, Inc., a company whose president is Steve Supplier, and an impostor impersonates \nSteve Supplier, the check could be negotiated if the imposter indorses it as Supplier, Inc.’s, agent “Steve \nSupplier.”[2] \n \nSimilarly, suppose Love is approached by a young man who says to her, “My company sells tennis balls, \nand we’re offering a special deal this month: a can of three high-quality balls for $2 each. We’ll send your \norder to you by UPS.” He hands her a sample ball: it is substantial, and the price is good. Love has heard \nof the company the man says he represents; she makes out a check for $100 to “Sprocket Athletic Supply.” \nThe young man does not represent the company at all, but he cashes the check by forging the indorsement \nand the bank pays. Love takes the loss: surely she is more to blame than the bank. \n \nThe Fictitious Payee Rule \nSuppose Lorna Love has a bookkeeper, Abby Accountant. Abby presents several checks for Love to sign, \none made out to Carlos Aquino. Perhaps there really is no such person, or perhaps he is somebody whom \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n828 \nLove deals with regularly, but Accountant intends him to have no interest here. No matter: Love signs the \ncheck in the amount of $2,000. Accountant takes the check and indorses it: “Carlos Aquino, pay to the \norder of Abby Accountant.” Then she signs her name as the next indorser and cashes the check at Love’s \nbank. The check is good, even though it was never intended by Accountant that “Carlos Aquino”—\nthe fictitious payee—have any interest in the instrument. The theory here is to “place the loss on the \ndrawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for \ncollection.…The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.” [3] This is \nalso known as “the padded-payroll rule.” \n \nIn the imposter cases, Love drew checks made out to real names but gave them to the wrong person (the \nimposter); in the fictitious payee cases she wrote checks to a nonexistent person (or a real person who was \nnot intended to have any interest at all). \nThe Dishonest Employee Rule \nThe UCC takes head-on the recurring problem of a dishonest employee. It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love. If, say, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n829 \njanitor had stolen the checks, the result would be different, as the janitor is not entrusted with \nresponsibility regarding the instrument. \n \nNegligence \nNot surprisingly, though, if a person fails to exercise ordinary care and thereby substantially contributes",

The defendant owns and operates New York’s largest \nthoroughbred racetracks—Belmont Park Racetrack, Aqueduct Racetrack, and Saratoga Racetrack—where \nit stages thoroughbred horse races and conducts pari-mutuel wagering on them pursuant to a franchise \ngranted to the defendant by the State of New York. \n \nThe plaintiff was a Belmont Park Racetrack horse player. He attended the track and purchased from the \ndefendant a voucher for use in SAMS machines. As explained in [Citation]: \nIn addition to accepting bets placed at parimutuel facility windows staffed by facility employees, \n[some] facilities use SAMS. SAMS are automated machines which permit a bettor to enter his bet \nby inserting money, vouchers or credit cards into the machine, thereby enabling him to select the \nnumber or combination he wishes to purchase. A ticket is issued showing those numbers. [1] \n \nWhen a voucher is utilized for the purpose of placing a bet at a SAMS machine, the SAMS machine, after \ndeducting the amount bet by the horse player during the particular transaction, provides the horse player \nwith, in addition to his betting ticket(s), a new voucher showing the remaining balance left on the \nvoucher. \n \nIn the instant case, the unfortunate horse player departed the SAMS machine with his betting tickets, \nbut without his new voucher—showing thousands of dollars in remaining value—which he inadvertently \nleft sitting in the SAMS machine. Within several minutes he realized his mistake and hurried back to the \nSAMS machine, only to find the voucher gone. He immediately notified a security guard. The defendant’s \npersonnel thereafter quickly confirmed the plaintiff as the original purchaser of the lost voucher. The \ndefendant placed a computerized “stop” on the voucher. However, whoever had happened upon the \nvoucher in the SAMS machine and taken it had acted even more quickly: the voucher had been brought to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n832 \na nearby track window and “cashed out” within a minute or so of the plaintiff having mistakenly left it in \nthe SAMS machine. \n \nThe plaintiff now sues the defendant, contending that the defendant should be liable for having failed to \n“provide any minimal protection to its customers” in checking the identity and ownership of vouchers \nprior to permitting their “cash out.” The defendant, in response, contends that the voucher consists of \n“bearer paper,” negotiable by anyone having possession, and that it is under no obligation to purchasers \nof vouchers to provide any such identity or ownership checks. \n \nAs opposed to instruments such as ordinary checks, which are typically made payable to the order of a \nspecific person and are therefore known as “order paper,” bearer paper is payable to the “bearer,” i.e., \nwhoever walks in carrying (or “bearing”) the instrument. Pursuant to [New York’s UCC] “[a]n instrument \nis payable to bearer when by its terms it is payable to…(c) ‘cash’ or the order of ‘cash’, or any other \nindication which does not purport to designate a specific payee.” \n \nEach New York Racing Association voucher is labeled “Cash Voucher.” Each voucher contains the legend \n“Bet Against the Value or Exchange for Cash.” Each voucher is also encoded with certain computer \nsymbols which are readable by SAMS machines. The vouchers do by their terms constitute “bearer paper.” \n \nThere is no doubt that under the [1990 Revision] Model Uniform Commercial Code the defendant would \nbe a “holder in due course” of the voucher, deemed to have taken it free from all defenses that could be \nraised by the plaintiff. As observed in 2 White & Summers, Uniform Commercial Code pp. 225–226, 152–\n153 (4th ed.1995): \n \nConsider theft of bearer instruments…[T]he thief can make his or her transferee a holder simply \nby transfer to one who gives value in good faith. If the thief’s transferee cashes the check and so \ngives value in good faith and without notice of any defense, that transferee will be a holder in due \ncourse under 3-302, free of all claims to the instrument on the part…of any person and free of all \npersonal defenses of any prior party. Therefore, the holder in due course will not be liable in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n833 \nconversion to the true owner.…Of course, the owner of the check will have a good cause of action \nagainst the thief, but no other cause of action.… \n \nIf an instrument is payable to bearer…the possessor of the instrument will be a holder and, if he \nmeets the other tests, a holder in due course. This is so even though the instrument may have \npassed through the hands of a thief; the holder in due course is one of the few purchasers in \nAnglo-Saxon jurisprudence who may derive a good title from a chain of title that includes a thief \nin its links. \nHowever, the Model Uniform Commercial Code in its present form is not in effect in New York.

[2] In 1990, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute \napproved a revised Article 3. This revised Article 3 has never been enacted in New York. Comment 1 to § \n3-201 of the [1990] Uniform Commercial Code, commenting on the difference between it and its \npredecessor (which is still in effect in New York), states: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument…as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. \n“Negotiation” is the term used in Article 3 to describe this post-issuance event.…In defining \n“negotiation” former Section 3-202(1) used the word “transfer,” an undefined term, and \n“delivery,” defined in Section 1-201(14) to mean voluntary change of possession. Instead, \nsubsections (a) and (b) [now] use the term “transfer of possession,” and subsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the \nholder of the instrument when possession is obtained. In this case there is an involuntary transfer \nof possession that results in negotiation to Thief or Finder. \n \nThus, it would initially appear that under the prior Model Uniform Commercial Code, still in effect in New \nYork, a thief or finder of bearer paper, as the recipient of an involuntary transfer, could not become a \n“holder,” and thus could not pass holder-in-due-course status, or good title, to someone in the position of \nthe defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n834 \nThis conclusion, however, is not without doubt. For instance, in 2 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code § \n3-202:35 (2nd ed.1971), it was observed that: \n \nThe Code states that bearer paper is negotiated by “delivery.” This is likely to mislead for one is \nnot inclined to think of the acquisition of paper by a finder or a thief as a “voluntary transfer of \npossession.” \nBy stating that the Code’s terminology was “misleading,” the treatise appears to imply that despite the \nliteral import of the words, the contrary was true—negotiation could be accomplished by involuntary \ntransfer, i.e., loss or theft. \n \nIn [Citation], the Appellate Division determined that the Tropicana Casino in New Jersey became a holder \nin due course of signed cashier’s checks with blank payee designations which a thief had stolen from the \ndefendant and negotiated to the casino for value after filling in the payee designation with his brother-in-\nlaw’s name. The Appellate Division, assuming without discussion that the thief was a “holder” of the \nstolen instruments and therefore able to transfer good title, held the defendant obligated to make \npayment on the stolen checks. Accord [Citation] (check cashing service which unknowingly took for value \nfrom an intervening thief the plaintiff’s check, which the plaintiff had endorsed in blank and thus \nconverted to a bearer instrument, was a holder in due course of the check, having received good title from \nthe thief). \n \nPresumably, these results have occurred because the courts in New York have implicitly interpreted the \nundefined term “transfer” as utilized in [the pre-1990] U.C.C. § 3-202(1) as including the involuntary \ntransfer of possession, so that as a practical matter the old Code (as still in effect in New York) has the \nsame meaning as the new Model Uniform Commercial Code, which represents a clarification rather than a \nchange in the law. \n \nThis result makes sense. A contrary result would require extensive verification procedures to be \nundertaken by all transferees of bearer paper. The problem with imposing an identity or ownership check \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n835 \nrequirement on the negotiation of bearer paper is that such a requirement would impede the free \nnegotiability which is the essence of bearer paper. As held in [Citation (1970)], \n \n[Where] the instrument entrusted to a dishonest messenger or agent was freely negotiable bearer \npaper…the drawee bank [cannot] be held liable for making payment to one presenting a \nnegotiable instrument in bearer form who may properly be presumed to be a holder [citations \nomitted]. \n…Moreover, the plaintiff in the instant case knew that the voucher could be “Exchange[d] for cash.” The \nplaintiff conceded at trial that (1) when he himself utilized the voucher prior to its loss, no identity or",

Wachovia Bank, N.A. \n2006 WL 773020 (Penn. [Trial Court] 2006) \n \nAbramson, J. \n \nBackground \nThis is a subrogation action brought by the insurance carrier for plaintiff Victory Clothing, Inc. \n(“Victory”), to recover funds paid to Victory under an insurance policy. This matter arises out of thefts \nfrom Victory’s commercial checking account by its office manager and bookkeeper, Jeanette Lunny \n(“Lunny”). Lunny was employed by Victory for approximately twenty-four (24) years until she resigned in \nMay 2003. From August 2001 through May 2003, Lunny deposited approximately two hundred (200) \nchecks drawn on Victory’s corporate account totaling $188,273.00 into her personal checking account at \ndefendant Wachovia Bank (“Wachovia”). Lunny’s scheme called for engaging in “double forgeries” \n(discussed infra). Lunny would prepare the checks in the company’s computer system, and make the \nchecks payable to known vendors of Victory (e.g., Adidas, Sean John), to whom no money was actually \nowed. The checks were for dollar amounts that were consistent with the legitimate checks to those \nvendors. She would then forge the signature of Victory’s owner, Mark Rosenfeld (“Rosenfeld”), on the \nfront of the check, and then forge the indorsement of the unintended payee (Victory’s various vendors) on \nthe reverse side of the check. The unauthorized checks were drawn on Victory’s bank account at Hudson \nBank (the “drawee bank” or “payor bank”). After forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either \nindorsed the check with her name followed by her account number, or referenced her account number \nfollowing the forged indorsement. She then deposited the funds into her personal bank account at \nWachovia (the “depositary bank” or “collecting bank”). \n \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance of checks \nfor deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited ONLY into a non-\npersonal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n837 \nRosenfeld reviewed the bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. However, among other \nobservable irregularities, he failed to detect that Lunny had forged his signature on approximately two \nhundred (200) checks. Nor did he have a procedure to match checks to invoices. \nIn its Complaint, Victory asserted a claim against Wachovia pursuant to the Pennsylvania Commercial \nCode, [3-405]…[it] states, in relevant part: \n \nEmployer’s responsibility for fraudulent indorsement by employee \n \n(b) RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.-For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a \nperson who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an \nemployer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the \nemployee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the \ninstrument, the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument",

Double Forgeries \nAs stated supra, this case involves a double forgery situation.

The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC” or “Code”) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n838 \naddresses the allocation of liability in cases where either the maker’s signature is forged or where the \nindorsement of the payee or holder is forged. [Citation] (“the Code accords separate treatment to forged \ndrawer signatures…and forged indorsements”). However, the drafters of the UCC failed to specifically \naddress the allocation of liability in double forgery situations.…Consequently, the courts have been left to \ndetermine how liability should be allocated in a double forgery case.… \n \nII. The Effect of the UCC Revisions \nIn 1990, new revisions to Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC were implemented (the “revisions”).…The new \nrevisions made a major change in the area of double forgeries. Before the revisions, the case law was \nuniform in treating a double forgery case as a forged drawer’s signature case [only], with the loss falling \n[only] on the drawee bank. The revisions, however, changed this rule by shifting to a comparative fault \napproach. Under the revised version of the UCC, the loss in double forgery cases is allocated between the \ndepositary and drawee banks based on the extent that each contributed to the loss.… \n \nSpecifically, revised § 3-405 of the UCC, entitled “Employer’s Responsibility for Fraudulent Indorsement \nby Employee,” introduced the concept of comparative fault as between the employer of the dishonest \nemployee/embezzler and the bank(s). This is the section under which Victory sued Wachovia. Section 3-\n405(b) states, in relevant part: \n \nIf the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise \nordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss \nresulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to \nexercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. \n \nWachovia argues that this section is applicable only in cases of forged indorsements, and not in double \nforgery situations. However, at least one court has found that the new revisions have made section 3-405 \napply to double forgery situations. “Nothing in the [Revised UCC] statutory language indicates that, where \nthe signature of the drawer is forged…the drawer is otherwise precluded from seeking recovery from a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n839 \ndepositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII. The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement:",

[plaintiff] (“Wisner”), appeals from a summary judgment in favor of the \ndefendant, Richland State Bank. At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that \nalone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating \nthe instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on \nthe instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying \nwords is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n846 \nsignature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a \npurpose other than indorsement. \n \nThis paragraph was placed on the back of the check by the government as the maker or drawer of the \ncheck. Consequently, the bank argues that Gill as sole payee could waive, ignore or strike out the \nlanguage. \n \nAlthough the Louisiana jurisprudence contains no similar case dealing with the Uniform Commercial \nCode, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance…In [Citation, a New Jersey case] (1975), the drawer \nof a check placed instructions on the backs of several checks…that the instruments not be deposited until \na specific future date. However, the payee presented some of the checks prior to the date specified on the \nback. The court found that the drawer did not have the capacity to indorse the instruments; as a result the \ntyped instructions on the backs of the checks could not be indorsements. Instead, they were “merely \nrequests to plaintiff who may or may not comply at its own pleasure. The instructions are neither binding \non plaintiff nor the subsequent holders.” In other words, the payee could ignore the instructions. \n \nIn the instant case, the payee did precisely that. Gill ignored the writing on the back of the check and \ninstructed the teller at the defendant bank to do the same through verbal and written instructions. \n \nWisner argues that by affixing his signature under the writing on the back of the check, Gill made it his \nown indorsement. Furthermore, it asserts that it was a restrictive indorsement, not a conditional one \nwhich could be disregarded pursuant to 3-206. Wisner relies upon the provisions of 3-206 for the \nproposition that the check had a restrictive indorsement and that the bank converted the check because it \nfailed to apply the amount it paid consistently with the indorsement. However, Comment 3 to 3-206 \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \nThis Article does not displace the law of waiver as it may apply to restrictive indorsements. The \ncircumstances under which a restrictive indorsement may be waived by the person who made it \nis not determined by this Article. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n847 \n \nNot all jurisdictions recognize a doctrine of waiver of restrictive indorsements. [Citing cases from various \njurisdictions in which a bank customer effectively requested the bank to disregard a restrictive \nindorsement; some cases affirmed the concept that the restriction could be waived (disregarded), others \ndid not.] \n \n… \n \nIn two cases arising under pre-UCC law, Louisiana recognized that indorsements could be ignored or \nstruck out. In [Citation] (1925), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the holder of a check could erase \nor strike out a restrictive indorsement on a check that was not necessary to the holder’s title. In [Citation] \n(1967), the court stated that an erroneous indorsement could be ignored and even struck out as \nunnecessary to the plaintiff’s title. \n \nLike the trial court, we find that when Gill affixed his signature under the writing on the back of the check, \nhe made it his own indorsement. We further find that the indorsement was restrictive, not conditional. As \nGill’s own restrictive indorsement, he could waive it and direct that the check, upon which he was \ndesignated as the sole payee, be deposited in his account in its entirety. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS",

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable \nobligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument. \n \n1. For a promise, to the extent performed. Suppose A contracts with B: “I’ll buy your car for $5,000.” \nUnder contract law, A has given consideration: the promise is enough. But this executory (not yet \nperformed) promise given by A is not giving “value” to support the HDC status because the promise has \nnot been performed. \n \nLorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Purchaser gives her a note in that amount. \nLove negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets to be delivered in thirty \ndays. Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets. Love has a claim for $5,000 against Rackets, which is not \nan HDC because its promise to deliver is still executory. Assume Paul Purchaser has a defense against \nLove (a reason why he doesn’t want to pay on the note), perhaps because the car was defective. When \nRackets presents the note to Purchaser for payment, he refuses to pay, raising his defense against Love. If \nRackets had been an HDC, Purchaser would be obligated to pay on the note regardless of the defense he \nmight have had against Love, the payee. See Carter & Grimsley v. Omni Trading, Inc., Section 21.3 \n\"Cases\", regarding value as related to executory contracts. \n \nA taker for value can be a partial HDC if the consideration was only partly performed. Suppose the tennis \nrackets were to come in two lots, each worth $2,500, and Rackets only delivered one lot. Rackets would be \nan HDC only to the extent of $2,500, and the debtor—Paul Purchaser—could refuse to pay $2,500 of the \npromised sum. \n \nThe UCC presents two exceptions to the rule that an executory promise is not value. Section 3-303(a)(4) \nprovides that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if the issuer or transferor gives it in \nexchange for a negotiable instrument, and Section 3-303(5) says an instrument is transferred for value if \nthe issuer gives it in exchange for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n857 \n2. Security interest. Value is not limited to cash or the fulfillment of a contractual obligation. A holder \nwho acquires a lien on, or a security interest in, an instrument other than by legal process has taken for \nvalue. \n \n3. Antecedent debt. Likewise, taking an instrument in payment of, or as security for, a prior claim, \nwhether or not the claim is due, is a taking for value. Blackstone owes Webster $1,000, due in thirty days. \nBlackstone unexpectedly receives a refund check for $1,000 from the Internal Revenue Service and \nindorses it to Webster. Webster is an HDC though he gave value in the past. \n \nThe rationale for the rule of value is that if the holder has not yet given anything of value in exchange for \nthe instrument, he still has an effective remedy should the instrument prove defective: he can rescind the \ntransaction, given the transferor’s breach of warranty. \n \nIn Good Faith \nSection 3-103(4) of the UCC defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing.” \n \nHonesty in Fact \n“Honesty in fact” is subjectively tested. Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test.

A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC. Not all paper \ncontains a due date for the entire amount, and demand paper has no due date at all. In Sections 3-\n302(a)(2) and 3-304, the UCC sets out specific rules dictating what is overdue paper. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Has Been Dishonored \nDishonor means that instrument is not paid when it is presented to the party who should pay it. \n \nWithout Notice of a Defense or Claim \nA purchaser of an instrument cannot be an HDC if he has notice that there are any defenses or claims \nagainst it. A defense is a reason why the would-be obligor will not pay; a claim is an assertion of \nownership in the instrument. If a person is fraudulently induced to issue or make an instrument, he has a \nclaim to its ownership and a defense against paying. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n859 \nWithout Notice of Unauthorized Signature or Alteration \nThis is pretty clear: a person will fail to achieve the HDC status if he has notice of alteration or an \nunauthorized signature. \n \nWithout Reason to Question the Instrument’s Authenticity Because of Apparent Forgery, \nAlteration, or Other Irregularity or Incompleteness as to Call into Question Its Authenticity \nThis also is pretty straightforward, though it is worth observing that a holder will flunk the HDC test if she \nhas notice of unauthorized signature or alteration, or if she should have notice on account of apparent \nirregularity. So a clever forgery would not by itself defeat the HDC status, unless the holder had notice of \nit. \n \nPayee as Holder in Due Course \nThe payee can be an HDC, but in the usual circumstances, a payee would have knowledge of claims or \ndefenses because the payee would be one of the original parties to the instrument. Nevertheless, a payee \nmay be an HDC if all the prerequisites are met. For instance, Blackstone fraudulently convinces \nWhitestone into signing a note as a comaker, with Greenstone as the payee. Without authority, Blackstone \nthen delivers the note for value to Greenstone. Having taken the note in good faith, for value, without \nnotice of any problems, and without cause to question its validity because of apparent irregularities, \nGreenstone is an HDC. In any event, typically the HDC is not the payee of the instrument, but rather, is an \nimmediate or remote transferee of the payee. \n \nThe Shelter Rule \nThere is one last point to mention before we get to the real nub of the holder-in-due-course concept (that \nthe sins of her predecessors are washed away for an HDC). The shelter rule provides that the transferee \nof an instrument acquires the same rights that the transferor had. Thus a person who does not himself \nqualify as an HDC can still acquire that status if some previous holder (someone “upstream”) was an \nHDC. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n860",

Understand how the holder-in-due-course doctrine has been modified for consumer transactions and why. \n \n \nDefenses \nWe mentioned in Section 21.1 \"Holder in Due Course\" that the importance of the holder-in-due-course \nstatus is that it promotes ready transferability of commercial paper by giving transferees confidence that \nthey can buy and in turn sell negotiable instruments without concern that somebody upstream—previous \nholders in the chain of distribution—will have some reason not to pay. The holder-in-due-course doctrine \nmakes the paper almost as readily transferable as cash. Almost, but not quite. We examine first the \ndefenses to which the holder in due course (HDC) is not subject and then—the “almost” part—the \ndefenses to which even HDCs are subject. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Not Subject to Personal Defenses \nAn HDC is not subject to the obligor’s personal defenses. But a holder who is not an HDC is subject to \nthem: he takes a negotiable instrument subject to the possible personal claims and defenses of numerous \npeople. \nIn general, the personal defenses—to which the HDC is not subject—are similar to the whole range of \ndefenses for breach of simple contract: lack of consideration; failure of consideration; duress, undue \ninfluence, and misrepresentation that does not render the transaction void; breach of warranty; \nunauthorized completion of an incomplete instrument; prior payment. Incapacity that does not render the \ntransaction void (except infancy) is also a personal defense. As the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) puts \nit, this includes “mental incompetence, guardianship, ultra vires acts or lack of corporate capacity to do \nbusiness, or any other incapacity apart from infancy. If under the state law the effect is to render the \nobligation of the instrument entirely null and void, the defense may be asserted against a holder in due \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n863 \ncourse. If the effect is merely to render the obligation voidable at the election of the obligor, the defense is \ncut off.” [1] James White and Robert Summers, in their hornbook on the UCC, opine that unconscionability \nis almost always a personal defense, not assertable against an HDC. [2] But again, the HDC takes free only \nfrom personal defenses of parties with whom she has not dealt. So while the payee of a note can be an \nHDC, if he dealt with the maker, he is subject to the maker’s defenses. \n \nHolder in Due Course Is Subject to Real Defenses \nAn HDC in a nonconsumer transaction is not subject to personal defenses, but he is subject to the so-\ncalled real defenses (or “universal defenses”)—they are good against an HDC. \nThe real defenses good against any holder, including HDCs, are as follows (see Figure 21.2 \"Real \nDefenses\"): \n \n1. Unauthorized signature (forgery) (UCC, Section 3-401(a)) \n2. Bankruptcy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n3. Infancy (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n4. Fraudulent alteration (UCC, Section 3-407(b) and (c)) \n5. Duress, mental incapacity, or illegality that renders the obligation void (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n6. Fraud in the execution (UCC, Section 3-305(a)) \n7. Discharge of which the holder has notice when he takes the instrument (UCC, Section 3-601) \nFigure 21.2 Real Defenses \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n864 \nAnalysis of the Real Defenses \nThough most of these concepts are pretty clear, a few comments by way of analysis are appropriate. \n \nForgery \nForgery is a real defense to an action by an HDC. As we have noted, though, negligence in the making or \nhandling of a negotiable instrument may cut off this defense against an HDC—as, for example, when a \ndrawer who uses a rubber signature stamp carelessly leaves it unattended. And notice, too, that Section 3-\n308 of the UCC provides that signatures are presumed valid unless their validity is specifically denied, at \nwhich time the burden shifts to the person claiming validity. These issues are discussed in Triffin v. \nSomerset Valley Bank, in Section 21.3 \"Cases\" of this chapter. \n \nBankruptcy \nDrawers, makers, and subsequent indorsers are not liable to an HDC if they have been discharged in \nbankruptcy. If they were, bankruptcy would not serve much purpose. \n \n \n \nInfancy \nWhether an infant’s signature on a negotiable instrument is a valid defense depends on the law of the \nstate. In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a",

App. 1999) \n \nLytton, J. \n \nFacts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n869 \nOmni purchased some grain from Country Grain, and on February 2, 1996, it issued two checks, totaling \n$75,000, to Country Grain. Country Grain, in turn, endorsed the checks over to Carter as a retainer for \nfuture legal services. Carter deposited the checks on February 5; Country Grain failed the next day. On \nFebruary 8, Carter was notified that Omni had stopped payment on the checks. Carter subsequently filed \na complaint against Omni…alleging that it was entitled to the proceeds of the checks, plus pre-judgment \ninterest, as a holder in due course.…[Carter moved for summary judgment; the motion was denied.] \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nCarter argues that its motion for summary judgment should have been granted because, as a holder in due \ncourse, it has the right to recover on the checks from the drawer, Omni. \n \nThe Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines a holder in due course as: \n“the holder of an instrument if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is \nnot otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity, and (2) the \nholder took the instrument (i) for value,… \n \nSection 3-303(a) of the UCC also states that: \n \n(a) “An instrument is issued or transferred for value if: (1) the instrument is issued or transferred \nfor a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed * * *.” \n(emphasis added) \n \nCarter contends that in Illinois a contract for future legal services should be treated differently than other \nexecutory contracts. It contends that when the attorney-client relationship is created by payment of a fee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n870 \nor retainer, the contract is no longer executory. Thus, Carter would achieve holder in due course status. \nWe are not persuaded. \n \nA retainer is the act of a client employing an attorney; it also denotes the fee paid by the client when he \nretains the attorney to act for him. [Citation] We have found no Illinois cases construing section 3-303(a) \nas it relates to a promise to perform future legal services under a retainer. The general rule, however, is \nthat “an executory promise is not value.” [Citation] “[T]he promise does not rise to the level of ‘value’ in \nthe commercial paper market until it is actually performed.” [Citation] \n \nThe UCC comment to section 303 gives the following example: \n \n“Case # 2. X issues a check to Y in consideration of Y’s promise to perform services in the future. Although \nthe executory promise is consideration for issuance of the check it is value only to the extent the promise \nis performed. \n \nWe have found no exceptions to these principles for retainers. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services. Under section 3-303(a)(1), it was a “promise of \nperformance,” not yet performed. Thus, no value was received, and Carter is not a holder in due course. \n \nFurthermore, in this case, no evidence was presented in the trial court that Carter performed any legal \nservices for Country Grain prior to receiving the checks. Without an evidentiary basis for finding that \nCarter received the checks for services performed, the trial court correctly found that Carter failed to \nprove that it was a holder in due course. [Citations] \n \nConclusion \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n871 \nBecause we have decided that Carter did not take the checks for value under section 3-303(a) of the UCC, \nwe need not address its other arguments. \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed. \n \nHoldridge, J., dissenting. \nI respectfully dissent. In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Camp \n825 N.E.2d 644 (Ohio App. 2005) \n \nDonovan, J. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n872 \nDefendant-appellant Shawn Sheth appeals from a judgment of the Xenia Municipal Court in favor of \nplaintiff-appellee Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. (“Buckeye”). Sheth contends that the trial court erred in \nfinding that Buckeye was a holder in due course of a postdated check drawn by Sheth and therefore was \nentitled to payment on the instrument despite the fact that Sheth had issued a stop-payment order to his \nbank. \n \nIn support of this assertion, Sheth argues that the trial court did not use the correct legal standard in \ngranting holder-in-due-course status to Buckeye. In particular, Sheth asserts that the trial court used the \npre-1990 Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) definition of “good faith” as it pertains to holder-in-due-\ncourse status, which defined it as “honesty in fact.” The definition of “good faith” was extended by the \nauthors of the UCC in 1990 to also mean “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” The post-1990 definition was adopted by the Ohio legislature in 1994. \n \nSheth argues that while Buckeye would prevail under the pre-1990, “honesty in fact” definition of “good \nfaith,” it failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner when it chose to cash the postdated check \ndrawn by Sheth. The lower court…adjudged Buckeye to be a holder in due course and, therefore, entitled \nto payment. We conclude that the trial court used the incorrect “good faith” standard when it granted \nholder-in-due-course status to Buckeye because Buckeye did not act in a commercially reasonable manner \nwhen it cashed the postdated check drawn by Sheth. Because we accept Sheth’s sole assignment of error, \nthe judgment of the trial court is reversed. \n \nOn or about October 12, 2003, Sheth entered into negotiations with James A. Camp for Camp to provide \ncertain services to Sheth by October 15, 2003. To that end, Sheth issued Camp a check for $1,300. The \ncheck was postdated to October 15, 2003. \n \nOn October 13, 2003, Camp negotiated the check to Buckeye and received a payment of $1,261.31. \nApparently fearing that Camp did not intend to fulfill his end of the contract, Sheth contacted his bank on \nOctober 14, 2003, and issued a stop-payment order on the check. Unaware of the stop-payment order, \nBuckeye deposited the check with its own bank on October 14, 2003, believing that the check would reach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n873 \nSheth’s bank by October 15, 2003. Because the stop-payment order was in effect, the check was ultimately \ndishonored by Sheth’s bank. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain payment directly from Sheth, \nBuckeye brought suit. \n \nSheth’s sole assignment of error is as follows: \n \n“The trial court erred by applying the incorrect legal standard in granting holder in due course status to \nthe plaintiff-appellee because the plaintiff-appellee failed to follow commercially reasonable standards in \nelecting to cash the check that gives rise to this dispute.” \n \n[UCC 3-302] outlines the elements required to receive holder-in-due-course status. The statute states: \n \n…‘holder in due course’ means the holder of an instrument if both of the following apply: \n \n“(1) The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear evidence of forgery or \nalteration that is so apparent, or is otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question \nits authenticity; \n“(2) The holder took the instrument under all of the following circumstances: \n(a) For value; \n(b) In good faith; \n(c) Without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an \nuncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series; \n(d) Without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered; \n(e) Without notice of any claim to the instrument as described in [3-306];",

Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn. All eighteen checks bore a red and green facsimile drawer’s signature stamp in the name of \nAlfred M. Hauser.

Judge Hoens concluded that because the \ncheck cashing companies took the checks in good faith, plaintiff was a holder in due course as assignee. \nJudge Hoens also found that because the checks appeared to be genuine, Hauser Co. was required, but \nhad failed, to show that plaintiff’s assignor had any notice that the checks were not validly drawn.… \n \nHauser Co. argues that summary judgment was improperly granted because the court failed to properly \naddress Hauser Co.’s defense that the checks at issue were invalid negotiable instruments and therefore \nerred in finding plaintiff was a holder in due course. \n \nAs a threshold matter, it is evident that the eighteen checks meet the definition of a negotiable instrument \n[UCC 3-104]. Each check is payable to a bearer for a fixed amount, on demand, and does not state any \nother undertaking by the person promising payment, aside from the payment of money. In addition, each \ncheck appears to have been signed by Mr. Hauser, through the use of a facsimile stamp, permitted by the \nUCC to take the place of a manual signature. [Section 3-401(b) of the UCC] provides that a “signature may \nbe made manually or by means of a device or machine…with present intention to authenticate a writing.” \nIt is uncontroverted by Hauser Co. that the facsimile signature stamp on the checks is identical to Hauser \nCo.’s authorized stamp. \n \nHauser Co., however, contends that the checks are not negotiable instruments because Mr. Hauser did not \nsign the checks, did not authorize their signing, and its payroll service, ADP, did not produce the checks. \nLack of authorization, however, is a separate issue from whether the checks are negotiable instruments. \nConsequently, given that the checks are negotiable instruments, the next issue is whether the checks are \nunenforceable by a holder in due course, because the signature on the checks was forged or unauthorized. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n879 \n \n[Sections 3-203 and 3-302 of the UCC] discuss the rights of a holder in due course and the rights of a \ntransferee of a holder in due course.

The HDC takes the paper free of most defenses; an ordinary holder \ntakes the paper as an assignee, acquiring only the rights of the assignor. \n \nValue is not the same as consideration; hence, a promise will not satisfy this criterion until it has been \nperformed. The HDC must have given something of value other than a promise to give. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n884 \nGood faith means (1) honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned and (2) the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Honesty in fact is a subjective test, but the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards is objective. \n \nNotice is not limited to receipt of an explicit statement of defenses; a holder may be given notice through \ninferences that should be drawn from the character of the instrument. Thus an incomplete instrument, \none that bears marks of forgery, or one that indicates it is overdue may give notice on its face. Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses. A real, as opposed to a personal, defense may be \nasserted against the HDC. Personal defenses include fraud in the inducement, failure of consideration, \nnonperformance of a condition precedent, and the like. Real defenses consist of infancy, acts that would \nmake a contract void (such as duress), fraud in the execution, forgery, and discharge in bankruptcy. A \n1976 trade regulation rule of the Federal Trade Commission abolishes the holder-in-due-course rule for \nconsumer transactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

After Hilda had paid Paul $5,000 of the promised \n$7,500, Hilda learned that Mike had a defense: the tractor was defective.

The liability of an agent who signs commercial paper \n2. What contract liability is imposed when a person signs commercial paper \n3. What warranty liability is imposed upon a transferor \n4. What happens if there is payment or acceptance by mistake \n5. How parties are discharged from liability on commercial paper \n \n \nIn Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial \nPaper\", and Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\", we focused on the methods and \nconsequences of negotiating commercial paper when all the proper steps are followed. For example, \na maker gives a negotiable note to a payee, who properly negotiates the paper to a third-party holder \nin due course. As a result, this third party is entitled to collect from the maker, unless the latter has a \nreal defense. \n \nIn this chapter, we begin by examining a question especially important to management: personal \nliability for signing company notes and checks. Then we look at the two general types of liability—\ncontract and warranty—introduced in Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". We conclude \nthe chapter by reviewing the ways in which parties are discharged from liability. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n889 \n \n \n \n22.1 Liability Imposed by Signature: Agents, Authorized and \nUnauthorized \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 3-402(a) of the UCC provides that a person acting (or purporting to act) as an agent who signs an \ninstrument binds the principal to the same extent that the principal would be bound if the signature were \non a simple contract. The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.”",

Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with \nthird parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Able signs his name on a note with an entirely illegible squiggle. Is that a valid signature? \n2. Under what circumstances is an agent clearly not personally liable on an instrument? \n3. Under what circumstances is a forgery effective as to the person whose name is forged? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n893 \n \n  \n \n[1] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 4-402(b)(1). \n[2] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-403. \n[3] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-406(b). \n \n \n \n \n22.2 Contract Liability of Parties \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1.

Know the conditions that must be met before secondary liability attaches. \n \n \nTwo types of liability can attach to those who deal in commercial paper: contract liability and warranty \nliability.

            "chunk": "contractual liability by indorsing “without recourse.”[7] \n \nConditions Required for Liability \nWe have alluded to the point that secondary parties do not become liable unless the proper conditions are \nmet—there are conditions precedent to liability (i.e., things have to happen before liability “ripens”). \n \nConditions for Liability in General \nThe conditions are slightly different for two classes of instruments. For an unaccepted draft, the drawer’s \nliability is conditioned on (1) presentment and (2) dishonor. For an accepted draft on a nonbank, or for an \nindorser, the conditions are (1) presentment, (2) dishonor, and (3) notice of dishonor. \n \nPresentment \nPresentment occurs when a person entitled to enforce the instrument (creditor) \ndemands payment from the maker, drawee, or acceptor, or when a person entitled to enforce the \ninstrument (again, the creditor) demandsacceptance of a draft from the drawee. [8] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n896 \nThe common-law tort that makes a person who wrongfully takes another’s property liable for that taking \nis conversion—it’s the civil equivalent of theft. The UCC provides that “the law applicable to conversion \nof personal property applies to instruments.” [9] Conversion is relevant here because if an instrument is \npresented for payment or acceptance and the person to whom it is presented refuses to pay, accept, or \nreturn it, the instrument is converted. An instrument is also converted if a person pays an instrument on a \nforged indorsement: a bank that pays a check on a forged indorsement has converted the instrument and \nis liable to the person whose indorsement was forged. There are various permutations on the theme of \nconversion; here is one example from the Official Comment: \n \nA check is payable to the order of A. A indorses it to B and puts it into an envelope addressed to B. \nThe envelope is never delivered to B. Rather, Thief steals the envelope, forges B’s indorsement to \nthe check and obtains payment. Because the check was never delivered to B, the indorsee, B has \nno cause of action for conversion, but A does have such an action. A is the owner of the check. B \nnever obtained rights in the check. If A intended to negotiate the check to B in payment of an \nobligation, that obligation was not affected by the conduct of Thief. B can enforce that obligation. \nThief stole A’s property not B’s. [10] \n \nDishonor \nDishonor generally means failure by the obligor to pay on the instrument when presentment for \npayment is made (but return of an instrument because it has not been properly indorsed does not \nconstitute dishonor). The UCC at Section 3-502 has (laborious) rules governing what constitutes dishonor \nand when dishonor occurs for a note, an unaccepted draft, and an unaccepted documentary draft. (A \ndocumentary draft is a draft to be presented for acceptance or payment if specified documents, \ncertificates, statements, or the like are to be received by the drawee or other payor before acceptance or \npayment of the draft.) \n \n \n \nNotice of Dishonor \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n897 \nAgain, when acceptance or payment is refused after presentment, the instrument is said to be dishonored. \nThe holder has a right of recourse against the drawers and indorsers, but he is usually supposed to give \nnotice of the dishonor. Section 3-503(a) of the UCC requires the holder to give notice to a party before the \nparty can be charged with liability, unless such notice is excused, but the UCC exempts notice in a number \nof circumstances (Section 3-504, discussed in Section 22.2 \"Contract Liability of Parties\" on contract \nliability). The UCC makes giving notice pretty easy: it permits any party who may be compelled to pay the \ninstrument to notify any party who may be liable on it (but each person who is to be charged with liability \nmust actually be notified); notice of dishonor may “be given by any commercially reasonable means \nincluding an oral, written, or electronic communication”; and no specific form of notice is required—it is \n“sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been \ndishonored or has not been paid or accepted.” [11] Section 3-503(c) sets out time limits when notice of \ndishonor must be given for collecting banks and for other persons. An oral notice is unwise because it \nmight be difficult to prove. Usually, notice of dishonor is given when the instrument is returned with a \nstamp (“NSF”—the dreaded “nonsufficient funds”), a ticket, or a memo. \n \nSuppose—you’ll want to graph this out—Ann signs a note payable to Betty, who indorses it to Carl, who in \nturn indorses it to Darlene. Darlene indorses it to Earl, who presents it to Ann for payment. Ann refuses. \nAnn is the only primary party, so if Earl is to be paid he must give notice of dishonor to one or more of the \nsecondary parties, in this case, the indorsers. He knows that Darlene is rich, so he notifies only Darlene.",

If insolvency proceedings…have been \ninstituted against the party who is expected to pay and the transferor knows it, the concealment of that \nfact amounts to a fraud upon the transferee, and the warranty against knowledge of such proceedings is \nprovided accordingly.” [1] \n \n \n \nPresentment Warranties \nA payor paying or accepting an instrument in effect takes the paper from the party who presents it to the \npayor, and that party has his hand out. In doing so, the presenter makes certain implied promises to the \npayor, who is about to fork over cash (or an acceptance). The UCC distinguishes between warranties made \nby one who presents an unaccepted draft for payment and warranties made by one who presents other \ninstruments for payment. The warranties made by the presenter are as follows. [2] \n \nWarranties Made by One Who Presents an Unaccepted Draft \n1. The presenter is entitled to enforce the draft or to obtain payment or acceptance. This is “in effect a \nwarranty that there are no unauthorized or missing indorsements.” [3] Suppose Thief steals a check \ndrawn by Drawer to Payee and forges Payee’s signature, then presents it to the bank. If the bank pays \nit, the bank cannot charge Drawer’s account because it has not followed Drawer’s order in paying to \nthe wrong person (except in the case of an imposter or fictitious payee). It can, though, go back to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n904 \nThief (fat chance it can find her) on the claim that she breached the warranty of no unauthorized \nindorsement. \n2. There has been no alteration of the instrument. If Thief takes a check and changes the amount from \n$100 to $1,000 and the bank pays it, the bank can recover from Thief $900, the difference between \nthe amount paid by the bank and the amount Drawer (customer) authorized the bank to pay. [4]If the \ndrawee accepts the draft, the same rules apply. \n3. The presenter has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer is unauthorized. If the presenter \ndoesn’t know Drawer’s signature is forged and the drawee pays out on a forged signature, the drawee \nbears the loss. (The bank would be liable for paying out over the forged drawer’s signature: that’s why \nit has the customer’s signature on file.) \n \nThese rules apply—again—to warranties made by the presenter to a drawee paying out on an unaccepted \ndraft. The most common situation would be where a person has a check made out to her and she gets it \ncashed at the drawer’s bank. \n \n \nWarranties Made by One Who Presents Something Other Than an Unaccepted Draft \nIn all other cases, there is only one warranty made by the presenter: that he or she is a person entitled to \nenforce the instrument or obtain payment on it. \n \nThis applies to the presentment of accepted drafts, to the presentment of dishonored drafts made to the \ndrawer or an indorser, and to the presentment of notes. For example, Maker makes a note payable to \nPayee; Payee indorses the note to Indorsee, Indorsee indorses and negotiates the note to Subsequent \nParty. Subsequent Party presents the note to Maker for payment. The Subsequent Party warrants to \nMaker that she is entitled to obtain payment. If she is paid and is not entitled to payment, Maker can sue \nher for breach of that warranty. If the reason she isn’t entitled to payment is because Payee’s signature \nwas forged by Thief, then Maker can go after Thief: the UCC says that “the person obtaining payment \n[Subsequent Party] and a prior transferor [Thief] warrant to the person making payment in good faith \n[Maker] that the warrantor [Subsequent Party] is entitled to enforce the instrument.” [5] Or, again, Drawer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n905 \nmakes the check out to Payee; Payee attempts to cash or deposit the check, but it is dishonored. Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it",

App. 2008) \n \nGabbard, J. \n \nPlaintiff, Bank of Nichols Hills (BNH), appeals a trial court judgment for Defendant, Bank of Oklahoma \n(BOK), regarding payment of a forged check. The primary issue on appeal is whether BOK presented \nsufficient proof to support the trial court’s finding that the [UCC] § 3-406 preclusion defense applied. We \nfind that it did, and affirm. \n \nFacts \nMichael and Stacy Russell owned a mobile home in Harrah, Oklahoma. The home was insured by \nOklahoma Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau). The insurance policy provided that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n913 \nin case of loss, Farm Bureau “will pay you unless another payee is named on the Declarations page,” that \n“Loss shall be payable to any mortgagee named in the Declarations,” and that one of Farm Bureau’s duties \nwas to “protect the mortgagee’s interests in the insured building.” The Declarations page of the policy \nlisted Conseco Finance as the mortgagee. Conseco had a mortgage security interest in the home. \nIn August 2002, a fire completely destroyed the mobile home. The Russells submitted an insurance claim \nto Farm Bureau. Farm Bureau then negotiated a $69,000 settlement with the Russells, issued them a \ncheck in this amount payable to them and Conseco jointly, and mailed the check to the Russells. Neither \nthe Russells nor Farm Bureau notified Conseco of the loss, the settlement, or the mailing of the check. \n \nThe check was drawn on Farm Bureau’s account at BNH. The Russells deposited the check into their \naccount at BOK. The check contains an endorsement by both Russells, and a rubber stamp endorsement \nfor Conseco followed by a signature of a Donna Marlatt and a phone number. It is undisputed that \nConseco’s endorsement was forged. Upon receipt, BOK presented the check to BNH. BNH paid the \n$69,000 check and notified Farm Bureau that the check had been paid from its account. \n \nAbout a year later, Conseco learned about the fire and the insurance payoff. Conseco notified Farm \nBureau that it was owed a mortgage balance of more than $50,000. Farm Bureau paid off the balance and \nnotified BNH of the forgery. BNH reimbursed Farm Bureau the amount paid to Conseco. BNH then sued \nBOK. \n \nBoth banks relied on the Uniform Commercial Code. BNH asserted that under § 4-208, BOK had \nwarranted that all the indorsements on the check were genuine. BOK asserted an affirmative defense \nunder § 3-406, alleging that Farm Bureau’s own negligence contributed to the forgery. After a non-jury \ntrial, the court granted judgment to BOK, finding as follows: \n \n• \nConseco’s endorsement was a forgery, accomplished by the Russells; \n• \nFarm Bureau was negligent in the manner and method it used to process the claim and pay the \nsettlement without providing any notice or opportunity for involvement in the process to \nConseco; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n914 \n• \nFarm Bureau’s negligence substantially contributed to the Russells’ conduct in forging Conseco’s \nendorsement; and \n• \nBOK proved its affirmative defense under § 3-406 by the greater weight of the evidence. \n \nFrom this judgment, BNH appeals. \n \nAnalysis \nIt cannot be disputed that BOK breached its presentment warranty to BNH under § 4-208. [1] Thus the \nprimary issue raised is whether BOK established a preclusion defense under 3-406 [that BNH is \nprecluded from complaining about BOK’s breach of presentment warranty because of its own \nnegligence]. [2] BNH asserts that the evidence fails to establish this defense because the mailing of its \ncheck to and receipt by the insured “is at most an event of opportunity and has nothing to do with the \nactual forgery.” \n \nSection 3-406 requires less stringent proof than the “direct and proximate cause” test for general \nnegligence. [3] Conduct is a contributing cause of an alteration or forgery if it is a substantial factor in \nbringing it about, or makes it “easier for the wrongdoer to commit his wrong.” The UCC Comment to § 3-\n406 notes that the term has the meaning as used by the Pennsylvania court in Thompson [Citation]. \n \nIn Thompson, an independent logger named Albers obtained blank weighing slips, filled them out to show \nfictitious deliveries of logs for local timber owners, delivered the slips to the company, accepted checks \nmade payable to the timber owners, forged the owners’ signatures, and cashed the checks at the bank. \nWhen the company discovered the scheme, it sued the bank and the bank raised § 3-406 as a defense. The \ncourt specifically found that the company’s negligence did not have to be the direct and proximate cause \nof the bank’s acceptance of the forged checks. Instead, the defense applied because the company left blank \nlogging slips readily accessible to haulers, the company had given Albers whole pads of blank slips, the \nslips were not consecutively numbered, haulers were allowed to deliver both the original and duplicate",

Although histories of banking dwell on the relationship between \nbanks and the national government, the banking law that governs the daily operation of checking \naccounts is state based—Article 4 of the UCC. The enormous increase in noncheck banking has given \nrise to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a federal law. \n \n \n \n \n \n23.1 Banks and Their Customers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand how checks move, both traditionally and electronically. \n2. Know how Article 4 governs the relationship between a bank and its customers. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n939 \n \n \nThe Traditional Bank Collection Process \nThe Traditional System in General \nOnce people mostly paid for things with cash: actual bills. That is obviously not very convenient or safe: a \nlost ten-dollar bill is almost certainly gone, and carrying around large quantities of cash is dangerous \n(probably only crooks do much of that). Today a person might go for weeks without reaching for a bill \n(except maybe to get change for coins to put in the parking meter). And while it is indisputable that \nelectronic payment is replacing paper payment, the latter is still very significant. Here is an excerpt from a \nFederal Reserve Report on the issue: \n \nIn 2008, U.S. consumers had more payment instruments to choose from than ever before: four \ntypes of paper instruments—cash, check, money order, and travelers checks; three types of \npayment cards—debit, credit, and prepaid; and two electronic instruments—online banking bill \npayment (OBBP) and electronic bank account deductions (EBAD) using their bank account \nnumbers. The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used. The \nbank upon which a check is written is the payor bank (the drawee bank). The depository bank is the \none the payee deposits the check into. Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks. A bank \ncan take on more than one role: Roger in Seattle writes a check on his account at Seattle Bank and mails it \nto Julia in Los Angeles in payment for merchandise; Julia deposits it in her account at Bank of L.A. Bank \nof L.A. is a depository bank and a collecting bank. Any other bank through which the check travels (except \nthe two banks already mentioned) is an intermediary bank. \n \nCollection Process between Customers of the Same Bank \nIf the depository bank is also the payor bank (about 30% of all checks), the check is called an “on-us” item \nand UCC 4-215(e)(2) provides that—if the check is not dishonored—it is available by the payee “at the \nopening of the bank’s second banking day following receipt of the item.” Roger writes a check to Matthew, \nboth of whom have accounts at Seattle Bank; Matthew deposits the check on Monday. On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. Julia deposits it in her account at \nL.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank must somehow present the check to Seattle Bank either directly \nor through intermediary banks.

When the \npayor bank—Seattle Bank—gets the check it must pay it, unless the check is dishonored or returned (UCC \n4-302). \n \nPhysical Movement of Checks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n941 \nThe physical movement of checks—such as it still occurs—is handled by three possible systems. \n \nThe Federal Reserve System’s regional branches process checks for banks holding accounts with them. \nThe Feds charge for the service, and prior to 2004 it regularly included check collection, air \ntransportation of checks to the Reserve Bank (hired out to private contractors) and ground transportation \ndelivery of checks to paying banks. Reserve Banks handle about 27 percent of US checks, but the air \nservice is decreasing with “Check 21,” a federal law discussed below, that allows electronic transmission of \nchecks. \n \nCorrespondent banks are banks that have formed “partnerships” with other banks in order to \nexchange checks and payments directly, bypassing the Federal Reserve and its fees. Outside banks may go \nthrough a correspondent bank to exchange checks and payments with one of its partners. \n \nCorrespondent banks may also form a clearinghouse corporation, in which members exchange \nchecks and payments in bulk, instead of on a check-by-check basis, which can be inefficient considering \nthat each bank might receive thousands of checks in a day. The clearinghouse banks save up the checks \ndrawn on other members and exchange them on a daily basis. The net payments for these checks are often \nsettled through Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Board electronic funds transfer (EFT) system that handles \nlarge-scale check settlement among US banks. Correspondent banks and clearinghouse corporations \nmake up the private sector of check clearing, and together they handle about 43 percent of US checks. \n \nThe Electronic System: Check 21 Act \nRationale for the “Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act” \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Congress felt with renewed urgency that banks needed to present \nand clear checks in a way not dependent upon the physical transportation of the paper instruments by air \nand ground, in case such transportation facilities were disrupted. The federal Check Clearing for the 21st \nCentury Act (Public Law 108-100)—more commonly referred to as “Check 21 Act”—became effective in \n2004. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n942 \nBasic Idea of Check 21 Act \nCheck 21 Act provides the legal basis for the electronic transportation of check data. A bank scans the \ncheck. The data on the check is already encoded in electronically readable numbers and the data, now \nseparated (“truncated”) from the paper instrument (which may be destroyed), is transmitted for \nprocessing. “The Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, to replace the \noriginal check. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that is suitable for \nautomated processing in the same manner as the original check. The Act permits banks to provide \nsubstitute checks in place of original checks to subsequent parties in the check processing stream.…Any \nfinancial institution in the check clearing process can truncate the original check and create a substitute \ncheck. [3] However, in the check collection process it is not required that the image be converted to a \nsubstitute check: the electronic image itself may suffice. \n \nFor example, suppose Roger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. and mails it \nto her. Julia deposits it in her account at L.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank truncates the check \n(again, scans it and destroys the original) and transmits the data to Seattle Bank for presentation and \npayment. If for any reason Roger, or any appropriate party, wants a paper version, a substitute check will \nbe created (see Figure 23.1 \"Substitute Check Front and Back\"). Most often, though, that is not necessary: \nRoger does not receive the actual cancelled checks he wrote in his monthly statement as he did formerly. \nHe receives instead a statement listing paid checks he’s written and a picture of the check (not a substitute \ncheck) is available to him online through his bank’s website. Or he may receive his monthly statement",

However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2. May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.” \nIf the customer fails to indorse a check when depositing it in his account, the bank’s notation that the \ncheck was deposited by a customer or credited to his account takes effect as the customer’s \nindorsement. (Section 4-205(1)). \n3. Are any warranties given in the collection process? Yes. They are identical to those provided in \nArticle 3, except that they apply only to customers and collecting banks (4-207(a)). The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund? The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First \nBank, and you deposit it in Second Bank. Second Bank will make a “provisional settlement” with \nyou—that is, it will provisionally credit your account with $1,000, and that settlement will be final \nwhen First Bank debits the check writer’s account and credits Second Bank with the funds. Under \nSection 4-212(1), as long as the settlement was still provisional, a collecting bank has the right to a \n“charge-back” or refund if the check “bounces” (is dishonored). However, if settlement was final, the \nbank cannot claim a refund. \n \nWhat determines whether settlement is provisional or final? Section 4-213(1) spells out four events \n(whichever comes first) that will convert a payor bank’s provisional settlement into final settlement: \nWhen it (a) pays the item in cash; (b) settles without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n946 \nunder statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer; finishes posting the item to the \nappropriate account; or (d) makes provisional settlement and fails to revoke the settlement in the time \nand manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement. All clearinghouses have rules \npermitting revocation of settlement within certain time periods. For example an item cleared before 10 \na.m. may be returned and the settlement revoked before 2 p.m. From this section it should be apparent \nthat a bank generally can prevent a settlement from becoming final if it chooses to do so. \n \nRelationship with Customers \nThe relationship between a bank and its customers is governed by UCC Article 4. However, Section 4-\n103(1) permits the bank to vary its terms, except that no bank can disclaim responsibility for failing to act \nin good faith or to exercise ordinary care. Most disputes between bank and customer arise when the bank \neither pays or refuses to pay a check. Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified.",

All clearinghouses have rules permitting revocation of settlement within certain time periods. For example an item cleared before 10 a.m. may be returned and the settlement revoked before 2 p.m. From this section it should be apparent that a bank generally can prevent a settlement from becoming final if it chooses to do so."

Funds from other local \nchecks (drawn on institutions within the same Federal Reserve region) must be available within two \nworking days, while there is a maximum five-day wait for funds from out-of-town checks.

Traditionally this has been a process of physical transfer by air and ground \ntransportation from the depository bank to various intermediary banks to the payor bank where the check is \npresented. Since 2004 the Check 21 Act has encouraged a trend away from the physical transportation of \nchecks to the electronic transportation of the check’s data, which is truncated (stripped) from the paper \ninstrument and transmitted. However, if a paper instrument is required, a “substitute check” will recreate it. \nThe UCC’s Article 4 deals generally with aspects of the bank-customer relationship, including warranties on \npayment or collection of checks, payment of overdrafts, stop orders, and customers’ duties to detect \nirregularities.

What has developed is electronic fund transfer (EFT), a system that has changed how customers \ninteract with banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Paper checks have their advantages, \nbut their use is decreasing in favor of EFT. \n \nIn simplest terms, EFT is a method of paying by substituting an electronic signal for checks. A “debit \ncard,” inserted in the appropriate terminal, will authorize automatically the transfer of funds from your \nchecking account, say, to the account of a store whose goods you are buying. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n951 \n \n \n \nTypes of EFT \nYou are of course familiar with some forms of EFT: \n \n• \nThe automated teller machine (ATM) permits you to electronically transfer funds between \nchecking and savings accounts at your bank with a plastic ID card and a personal identification \nnumber (PIN), and to obtain cash from the machine. \n• \nTelephone transfers or computerized transfers allow customers to access the bank’s computer \nsystem and direct it to pay bills owed to a third party or to transfer funds from one account to \nanother. \n• \nPoint of sale terminals located in stores let customers instantly debit their bank accounts and \ncredit the merchant’s account. \n• \nPreauthorized payment plans permit direct electronic deposit of paychecks, Social Security \nchecks, and dividend checks. \n• \nPreauthorized withdrawals from customers’ bank accounts or credit card accounts allow paperless",

No checks change hands; no paper is written on. It is quiet, odorless, smudge proof. But errors \nare harder to trace than when a paper trail exists, and when the system fails (“our computer is down”) the \nfinancial mess can be colossal. Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation.",

These EFTs are ubiquitous, including ATMs, point-of-sale systems, direct deposits \nand withdrawals and online banking of various kinds. Responding to the need for consumer protection, \nCongress adopted the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, effective in 1978.

Understand what a “wholesale transaction” is; recognize that UCC Article 4A governs such transactions, and \nrecognize how the Article addresses three common issues. \n2. Know what a “letter of credit” (LC) is, the source of law regarding LCs, and how such instruments are used. \n \n \nWholesale Funds Transfers \nAnother way that money is transferred is by commercial fund transfers or wholesale funds transfers, \nwhich is by far the largest segment of the US payment system measured in amounts of money transferred. \nIt is trillions of dollars a day. Wholesale transactions are the transfers of funds between businesses or \nfinancial institutions. \n \nBackground and Coverage \nIt was in the development of commercial “wholesale wire transfers” of money in the nineteeth and early \ntwentieth centuries that businesses developed the processes enabling the creation of today’s consumer \nelectronic funds transfers. Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A. Consistent with other UCC provisions, the rights and \nobligations under Article 4A may be varied by agreement of the parties. Article 4A does not apply if any \nstep of the transaction is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Although the implication may be \notherwise, the rules in Article 4A apply to any funds transfer, not just electronic ones (i.e., transfers by \nmail are covered, too). Certainly, however, electronic transfers are most common, and—as the Preface to \nArticle 4A notes—a number of characteristics of them influenced the Code’s rules. These transactions are \ncharacterized by large amounts of money—multimillions of dollars; the parties are sophisticated \nbusinesses or financial institutions; funds transfers are completed in one day, they are highly efficient \nsubstitutes for paper delivery; they are usually low cost—a few dollars for the funds transfer charged by \nthe sender’s bank. \n \nOperation of Article 4A \nThe UCC “Prefatory Note” to Article 4A observes that “the funds transfer that is covered by Article 4A is \nnot a complex transaction.” To illustrate the operation of Article 4A, assume that Widgets International \nhas an account with First Bank. In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and",

Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then?

An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions \nand mandates of the statute.” Although detailed consideration of Article 5 is beyond the scope of this \nbook, a distinction between guarantees and letters of credit should be noted: Article 5 applies to the latter \nand not the former. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n962 \nLetters of Credit as Payment for Exports \nThe following discussion presents how letters of credit work as payment for exports, and a sample letter of \ncredit is presented at Figure 23.4 \"A Letter of Credit\". \n \nFigure 23.4 A Letter of Credit \n \nJulius desires to sell fine quality magic wands and other stage props to Rochelle’s Gallery in Paris. \nRochelle agrees to pay by letter of credit—she will, in effect, get her bank to inform Julius that he will get \npaid if the goods are right. She does so by “opening” a letter of credit at her bank—the issuing bank—the \nBanque de Rue de Houdini where she has funds in her account, or good credit. She tells the bank the \nterms of sale, the nature and quantity of the goods, the amount to be paid, the documents she will require \nas proof of shipment, and an expiration date. Banque de Rue de Houdini then directs its correspondent \nbank in the United States, First Excelsior Bank, to inform Julius that the letter of credit has been opened: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n963 \nRochelle is good for it. For Julius to have the strongest guarantee that he will be paid, Banque de Rou de \nHoudini can ask First Excelsior to confirm the letter of credit, thus binding both Banque de Rue de \nHoudini and Excelsior to pay according to the terms of the letter. \n \nOnce Julius is informed that the letter of credit has been issued and confirmed, he can proceed to ship the \ngoods and draw a draft to present (along with the required documents such as commercial invoice, bill of \nlading, and insurance policy) to First Excelsior, which is bound to follow exactly its instructions from \nBanque de Rue de Houdini. Julius can present the draft and documents directly, through correspondent \nbanks, or by a representative at the port from which he is shipping the goods. On presentation, First \nExcelsior may forward the documents to Banque de Rue de Houdini for approval and when First Excelsior \nis satisfied it will take the draft and pay Julius immediately on a sight draft or will stamp the draft \n“accepted” if it is a time draft (payable in thirty, sixty, or ninety days). Julius can discount an accepted \ntime draft or hold it until it matures and cash it in for the full amount. First Excelsior will then forward \nthe draft through international banking channels to Banque de Rue de Houdini to debit Rochelle’s \naccount. \n \nAs Payment for Imports \nUS importers—buyers—also can use the letter of credit to pay for goods bought from abroad. The \nimporter’s bank may require that the buyer put up collateral to guarantee it will be reimbursed for \npayment of the draft when it is presented by the seller’s agents.

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn. Although his order with the Lumber Company specifically provided for 4 x 6” runner boards, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n966 \nLumber Company used 2 x 6” boards. The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs. Baker testified that properly laminated two by six-inch boards are just as strong as \nfour by six-inch boards. \n \nMeade filed suit against the Bank in the trial court seeking $5,000 in damages.

The Bank filed a motion \nfor summary judgment, which the trial court denied. At the subsequent jury trial the court permitted \nMeade to testify, over the Bank’s objections, to the amount of his court costs, attorney fees, and deposition \ncosts associated with this case. The Bank filed motions for directed verdict at the close of Meade’s case \nand at the close of evidence, which the trial court denied. \n \nThe jury returned a general verdict finding the Bank liable to Meade in the amount of $3,800. The Bank \nfiled motions for a new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied. \nThe Bank now appeals, asserting the following five assignments of error.… \n \nII. \nIn its first assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for \nsummary judgment. Specifically, the Bank asserts that Meade did not issue the stop payment order within \na reasonable time for the Bank to act upon it, and therefore that the trial court should have granted \nsummary judgment in favor of the Bank. \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it has been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that \nreasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving \nparty. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages. [Citations] \n \nIn this case, the statute providing for damages, [UCC 4-403(c)], provides that a customer’s recoverable \nloss for a bank’s failure to honor a valid stop payment order “may include damages for dishonor of \nsubsequent items * * *.” The statute does not provide for recouping attorney fees and costs. Meade did not \nallege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages.

Meade did not \nallege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages. Additionally, although \nMeade argues that the Bank caused him to lose his bargaining power with the Lumber Company, Meade \ndid not present any evidence that he incurred attorney fees or costs by engaging in litigation with the \nLumber Company. \n \nAbsent statutory authority or an allegation of bad faith, attorney fees are improper in a compensatory \ndamage award.…Therefore, the trial court erred in permitting the jury to hear evidence regarding Meade’s \nexpenditures for his attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we sustain the Bank’s second assignment of \nerror.… \n \n \n \n \nIV. \nIn its third assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred when it overruled the Bank’s \nmotion for a directed verdict. The Bank moved for a directed verdict both at the conclusion of Meade’s \ncase and at the close of evidence. \n \nThe Bank first asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to show that Meade issued a \nstop payment order that provided it with a reasonable opportunity to act as required by [the UCC]. Meade \npresented evidence that he gave the Bank his stop payment order prior to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and that \nthe Bank paid the check the following day.…We find that this constitutes sufficient evidence that Meade \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n969 \ncommunicated the stop payment order to the Bank in time to allow the Bank a reasonable opportunity to \nact upon it. \n \nThe Bank also asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence that Meade incurred some loss \nresulting from its payment of the check. Pursuant to [UCC 4-403(c)] “[t]he burden of establishing the fact \nand amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop payment order or order to \nclose an account is on the customer.” Establishing the fact and amount of loss, “the customer must show \nsome loss other than the mere debiting of the customer’s account.” [Citation] \n \n…Baker testified that he charged Meade between two hundred-eighty and three hundred dollars to \nproperly laminate the runners and support the barn. Based upon these facts, we find that the record \ncontains sufficient evidence that Meade sustained some loss beyond the mere debiting of his account as a \nresult of the Bank paying his check. Accordingly, we overrule the Bank’s third assignment of error. \n \nV. \n…In its final assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motions for \njudgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.… \n[U]nlike our consideration of the Bank’s motions for a directed verdict, in considering the Bank’s motion \nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we also must consider whether the amount of the jury’s award \nis supported by sufficient evidence. The Bank contends the jury’s general verdict, awarding Meade \n$3,800, is not supported by evidence in the record. \n \nA bank customer seeking damages for the improper payment of a check over a valid stop payment order \ncarries the burden of proving “the fact and amount of loss.” [UCC 4-403(C).] To protect banks and \nprevent unjust enrichment to customers, the mere debiting of the customer’s account does not constitute \na loss. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n970 \nIn this case, the Bank’s payment of Meade’s $1,406.79 check to the Lumber Company discharged Meade’s \ndebt to the Lumber Company in the same amount. Therefore, the mere debiting of $1,406.79 from \nMeade’s account does not constitute a loss. \n \nMeade presented evidence that he incurred $300 in repair costs to make the barn satisfactory. Meade also \nnotes that he never got the four by six-inch runners he wanted. However, Meade’s carpenter, Baker, \ntestified that since he properly laminated the two by six-inch runners, they are just as strong or stronger \nthan the four by six-inch runners would have been. \n \nMeade also presented evidence of his costs and fees. However, as we determined in our review of the \nBank’s second assignment of error, only the court may award costs and fees, and therefore this evidence \nwas improperly admitted. Thus, the evidence cannot support the damage award. Meade did not present \nany other evidence of loss incurred by the Bank’s payment of his check.…Therefore, we find that the trial \ncourt erred in declining to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of damages. Upon \nremand, the trial court should grant in part the Bank’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict",

Whether Rogers’ Delay in Detecting the Forgeries Barred Suit against Union Planters. \n \nThe relationship between Rogers and Union Planters is governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial \nCode. [UCC] 4-406(a) and (c) provide that a bank customer has a duty to discover and report \n“unauthorized signatures”; i.e., forgeries. [The section] reflects an underlying policy decision that furthers \nthe UCC’s “objective of promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.” The UCC \nfacilitates financial transactions, benefiting both consumers and financial institutions, by allocating \nresponsibility among the parties according to whomever is best able to prevent a loss. Because the \ncustomer is more familiar with his own signature, and should know whether or not he authorized a \nparticular withdrawal or check, he can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n973 \ninstitution which may process thousands of transactions in a single day.…The customer’s duty to exercise \nthis care is triggered when the bank satisfies its burden to provide sufficient information to the customer. \nAs a result, if the bank provides sufficient information, the customer bears the loss when he fails to detect \nand notify the bank about unauthorized transactions. [Citation] \n \nA. Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address. A reasonable person who has not \nreceived a monthly statement from the bank would promptly ask the bank for a copy of the statement. \nHere, Rogers claims that she did not receive numerous statements. We find that she failed to act \nreasonably when she failed to take any action to replace the missing statements. \n \nB. Rogers’ Duty to Report the Forgeries under 4-406(d). \n[Under UCC 4-406] a customer who has not promptly notified a bank of an irregularity may be precluded \nfrom bringing certain claims against the bank: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n974 \n“(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties \nimposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the \nbank: \n(1) The customer’s unauthorized signature…on the item,… \n \nAlso, when there is a series of forgeries, 406(d)(2) places additional duties on the customer, [who is \nprecluded from asserting against the bank]: \n \n(2) The customer’s unauthorized signature…by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in \ngood faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the \ncustomer of the unauthorized signature…and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable \nperiod of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of \naccount and notify the bank. \nAlthough there is no mention of a specific date, Rogers testified that she and her son began looking for the \nstatements in late May or early June of 2001, after her husband had died.…When they discovered that \nstatements were missing, they notified Union Planters in June of 2001 to replace the statements. At this \ntime, no mention of possible forgery was made, even though Neal, Jr., thought that “something was \nwrong.” In fact, Neal, Jr., had felt that something was wrong as far back as December of 2000, but failed \nto do anything. Neal, Jr., testified that neither he nor his mother knew that Reese had been forging checks \nuntil September of 2001.

The federal Expedited Funds Availability Act requires that, within some limits, banks \nmake customers’ funds available quickly. \n \nWholesale funds transactions, involving tens of millions of dollars, were originally made by telegraph \n(“wire transfers”). The modern law governing such transactions is, in the United States, UCC Article 4A. \n \nA letter of credit is a statement by a bank or other financial institution that it will pay a specified sum of \nmoney to specified persons when certain conditions are met. Its purpose is to facilitate nonlocal sales \ntransactions by ensuring that the buyer will not get access to the goods until the seller has proper access to \nthe buyer’s money. In the US letters of credit are governed by UCC Article 5, and in international \ntransactions they may be covered by a different internationally recognized law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. On March 20, Al gave Betty a check for $1,000. On March 25, Al gave Carl a check for $1,000, which Carl \nimmediately had certified. On October 24, when Al had $1,100 in his account, Betty presented her check for \npayment and the bank paid her $1,000. On October 25, Carl presented his check for payment and the bank \nrefused to pay because of insufficient funds. Were the bank’s actions proper? \n2. Winifred had a balance of $100 in her checking account at First Bank. She wrote a check payable to her \nlandlord in the amount of $400. First Bank cashed the check and then attempted to charge her account. \nMay it? Why? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n982 \n3. Assume in Exercise 2 that Winifred had deposited $4,000 in her account a month before writing the check \nto her landlord. Her landlord altered the check by changing the amount from $400 to $4,000 and then \ncashed the check at First Bank. May the bank charge Winifred’s account for the check? Why? \n4. Assume in Exercise 2 that Winifred had deposited $5,000 in her account a month before writing the check \nbut the bank misdirected her deposit, with the result that her account showed a balance of $100. Believing \nthe landlord’s check to be an overdraft, the bank refused to pay it. Was the refusal justified? Why? \n5. Assume in Exercise 2 that, after sending the check to the landlord, Winifred decided to stop payment \nbecause she wanted to use the $300 in her account as a down payment on a stereo. She called First Bank \nand ordered the bank to stop payment. Four days later the bank mistakenly paid the check. Is the bank \nliable to Winifred? Why? \n6. Assume in Exercise 5 that the landlord negotiated the check to a holder in due course, who presented the \ncheck to the bank for payment. Is the bank required to pay the holder in due course after the stop payment \norder? Why? \n7. On Wednesday, August 4, Able wrote a $1,000 check on his account at First Bank. On Saturday, August 7, \nthe check was cashed, but the Saturday activity was not recorded by the bank until Monday, August 9. On \nthat day at 8:00 a.m., Able called in a stop payment order on the check and he was told the check had not \ncleared; at 9:00 he went to the bank and obtained a printed notice confirming the stop payment, but \nshortly thereafter the Saturday activity was recorded—Able’s account had been debited. He wants the \n$1,000 recredited. Was the stop payment order effective? Explain. \n8. Alice wrote a check to Carl’s Contracting for $190 on April 23, 2011. Alice was not satisfied with Carl’s work. \nShe called, leaving a message for him to return the call to discuss the matter with her. He did not do so, but \nwhen she reconciled her checks upon receipt of her bank statement, she noticed the check to Carl did not \nappear on the April statement. Several months went by. She figured Carl just tore the check up instead of \nbothering to resolve any dispute with her. The check was presented to Alice’s bank for payment on March \n20, 2012, and Alice’s bank paid it. May she recover from the bank?",

One reads that the \naverage household credit card debt (not including mortgages, auto loans, and student loans) in 2009 was \nalmost $16,000. [1] Or maybe it was $10,000. [2] Or maybe it was $7,300. [3]But probably focusing on \nthe average household debt is not very helpful: 55 percent of households have no credit card debt at all, \nand the median debt is $1,900. [4] \n \nIn 2007, the total household debt owed by Americans was $13.3 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve \nBoard. That is really an incomprehensible number: suffice it to say, then, that the availability of credit is \nan important factor in the US economy, and not surprisingly, a number of statutes have been enacted over \nthe years to protect consumers both before and after signing credit agreements. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n986 \nThe statutes tend to fall within three broad categories. First, several statutes are especially important \nwhen a consumer enters into a credit transaction. These include laws that regulate credit costs, the credit \napplication, and the applicant’s right to check a credit record. Second, after a consumer has contracted for \ncredit, certain statutes give a consumer the right to cancel the contract and correct billing mistakes.

Understand what statutes regulate the cost of credit, and the exceptions. \n2. Know how the cost of credit is expressed in the Truth in Lending Act. \n3. Recognize that there are laws prohibiting discrimination in credit granting. \n4. Understand how consumers’ credit records are maintained and may be corrected. \n \n \nThe Cost of Credit \nLenders, whether banks or retailers, are not free to charge whatever they wish for credit. Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business. (That’s why the giant Citibank, otherwise \nheadquartered in New York City, runs its credit card division out of South Dakota, which has no \nusury laws for credit cards.) \n• \nConsumer leasing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n988 \n• \n“Small loans” such as payday loans and pawnshop loans. \n• \nLease-purchases on personal property.

Moreover, certain charges are not considered interest, such as fees to record \ndocuments in a public office and charges for services such as title examinations, deed preparation, credit \nreports, appraisals, and loan processing. But a creditor may not use these devices to cloak what is in fact a \nusurious bargain; it is not the form but the substance of the agreement that controls. \n \nAs suggested, part of the difficulty here is that governments at all levels have for a generation attempted to \npromote consumption to promote production; production is required to maintain politically acceptable \nlevels of employment. If consumers can get what they want on credit, consumerism increases. Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

This amends the TILA by \nrequiring credit card issuers to disclose in a uniform manner the annual percentage rate, annual fees, \ngrace period, and other information on credit card applications. \n \nCredit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 \nThe 1989 act did make it possible for consumers to know the costs associated with credit card use, but the \ncard companies’ behavior over 20 years convinced Congress that more regulation was required. In 2009, \nCongress passed and President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act). It is a further amendment of the TILA. Some of the salient \nparts of the act are as follows: \n \n• \nRestricts all interest rate increases during the first year, with some exceptions. The purpose is to \nabolish “teaser” rates. \n• \nIncreases notice for rate increase on future purchases to 45 days. \n• \nPreserves the ability to pay off on the old terms, with some exceptions. \n• \nLimits fees and penalty interest and requires statements to clearly state the required due date and \nlate payment penalty. \n• \nRequires fair application of payments. Amounts in excess of the minimum payment must be \napplied to the highest interest rate (with some exceptions). \n• \nProvides sensible due dates and time to pay. \n• \nProtects young consumers. Before issuing a card to a person under the age of twenty-one, the card \nissuer must obtain an application that contains either the signature of a cosigner over the age of \ntwenty-one or information indicating an independent means of repaying any credit extended. \n• \nRestricts card issuers from providing tangible gifts to students on college campuses in exchange \nfor filling out a credit card application. \n• \nRequires colleges to publicly disclose any marketing contracts made with a card issuer. \n• \nRequires enhanced disclosures. \n• \nRequires issuers to disclose the period of time and the total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if only minimum monthly payments are made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n992 \n• \nEstablishes gift card protections. [1] \n \nThe Federal Reserve Board is to issue implementing rules. \n \nCreditors who violate the TILA are subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. Of these, the most \nimportant are the civil remedies open to consumers. If a creditor fails to disclose the required \ninformation, a customer may sue to recover twice the finance charge, plus court costs and reasonable \nattorneys’ fees, with some limitations. As to the Credit Card Act of 2009, the issuing companies were not \nhappy with the reforms. Before the law went into effect, the companies—as one commentator put it—\nunleashed a “frenzy of retaliation,” [2]by repricing customer accounts, changing fixed rates to variable \nrates, lowering credit limits, and increasing fees. \n \nState Credit Disclosure Laws \nThe federal TILA is not the only statute dealing with credit disclosures. A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check.

Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974. The act prohibits any creditor from discriminating “against any \napplicant on the basis of sex or marital status with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.” In 1976, \nCongress broadened the law to bar discrimination (1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, \nand age; (2) because all or a part of an applicant’s income is from a public assistance program; or (3) \nbecause an applicant has exercised his or her rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. \n \nUnder the ECOA, a creditor may not ask a credit applicant to state sex, race, national origin, or religion. \nAnd unless the applicant is seeking a joint loan or account or lives in a community-property state, the \ncreditor may not ask for a statement of marital status or, if you have voluntarily disclosed that you are \nmarried, for information about your spouse, nor may one spouse be required to cosign if the other is \ndeemed independently creditworthy. All questions concerning plans for children are improper. In \nassessing the creditworthiness of an applicant, the creditor must consider all sources of income, including \nregularly received alimony and child support payments. And if credit is refused, the creditor must, on \ndemand, tell you the specific reasons for rejection. See Rosa v. Park West Bank & Trust Co. in Section \n24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving the ECOA. \n \nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), 1977, get at \nanother type of discrimination: redlining. This is the practice by a financial institution of refusing to grant \nhome loans or home-improvement loans to people living in low-income neighborhoods. The act requires \nthat financial institutions within its purview report annually by transmitting information from their Loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n994 \nApplication Registers to a federal agency. From these reports it is possible to determine what is happening \nto home prices in a particular area, whether investment in one neighborhood lags compared with that in \nothers, if the racial or economic composition of borrowers changed over time, whether minorities or \nwomen had trouble accessing mortgage credit, in what kinds of neighborhoods subprime loans are \nconcentrated, and what types of borrowers are most likely to receive subprime loans, among others. \n“Armed with hard facts, users of all types can better execute their work: Advocates can launch consumer \neducation campaigns in neighborhoods being targeted by subprime lenders, planners can better tailor \nhousing policy to market conditions, affordable housing developers can identify gentrifying \nneighborhoods, and activists can confront banks with poor lending records in low income \ncommunities.” [4] Under the CRA, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA \ncompliance and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank \nbranches or for mergers or acquisitions. \n \nFair Credit Reporting Act of 1970: Checking the Applicant’s Credit Record \nIt is in the interests of all consumers that people who would be bad credit risks not get credit: if they do \nand they default (fail to pay their debts), the rest of us end up paying for their improvidence.

Because \ncredit is such a big business, a number of support industries have grown up around it. One of the most \nimportant is the credit-reporting industry, which addresses this issue of checking creditworthiness. \nCertain companies—credit bureaus—collect information about borrowers, holders of credit cards, store \naccounts, and installment purchasers. For a fee, this information—currently held on tens of millions of \nAmericans—is sold to companies anxious to know whether applicants are creditworthy. If the information \nis inaccurate, it can lead to rejection of a credit application that should be approved, and it can wind up in \nother files where it can live to do more damage. In 1970, Congress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to give consumers access to their credit files in order \nto correct errors. \n \nUnder this statute, an applicant denied credit has the right to be told the name and address of the credit \nbureau (called “consumer reporting agency” in the act) that prepared the report on which the denial was \nbased. (The law covers reports used to screen insurance and job applicants as well as to determine \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n995 \ncreditworthiness.) The agency must list the nature and substance of the information (except medical \ninformation) and its sources (unless they contributed to an investigative-type report). A credit report lists \nsuch information as name, address, employer, salary history, loans outstanding, and the like. An \ninvestigative-type report is one that results from personal interviews and may contain nonfinancial \ninformation, like drinking and other personal habits, character, or participation in dangerous sports. \nSince the investigators rely on talks with neighbors and coworkers, their reports are usually subjective and \ncan often be misleading and inaccurate. \n \nThe agency must furnish the consumer the information free if requested within thirty days of rejection \nand must also specify the name and address of anyone who has received the report within the preceding \nsix months (two years if furnished for employment purposes). \n \nIf the information turns out to be inaccurate, the agency must correct its records; if investigative material \ncannot be verified, it must be removed from the file. Those to whom it was distributed must be notified of \nthe changes. When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and \ndisclosure.

Understand that consumers have the right to cancel some purchases made on credit. \n2. Know how billing mistakes may be corrected. \n3. Recognize that professional debt collectors are governed by some laws restricting certain practices. \n \n \nCancellation Rights \nOrdinarily, a contract is binding when signed. But consumer protection laws sometimes provide an escape \nvalve. For example, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation gives consumers three days to cancel \ncontracts made with door-to-door salespersons. Under this cooling-off provision, the cancellation is \neffective if made by midnight of the third business day after the date of the purchase agreement. The \nsalesperson must notify consumers of this right and supply them with two copies of a cancellation form, \nand the sales agreement must contain a statement explaining the right. The purchaser cancels by \nreturning one copy of the cancellation form to the seller, who is obligated either to pick up the goods or to \npay shipping costs. The three-day cancellation privilege applies only to sales of twenty-five dollars or more \nmade either in the home or away from the seller’s place of business; it does not apply to sales made by \nmail or telephone, to emergency repairs and certain other home repairs, or to real estate, insurance, or \nsecurities sales. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects consumers in a similar way. For certain big-ticket purchases \n(such as installations made in the course of major home improvements), sellers sometimes require a \nmortgage (which is subordinate to any preexisting mortgages) on the home. The law gives such customers \nthree days to rescind the contract. Many states have laws similar to the FTC’s three-day cooling-off period, \nand these may apply to transactions not covered by the federal rule (e.g., to purchases of less than twenty-\nfive dollars and even to certain contracts made at the seller’s place of business). \n \nCorrecting Billing Mistakes \nBilling Mistakes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n998 \nIn 1975, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Billing Act as an amendment to the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act. It was intended to put to an end the phenomenon, by then a standard part of any \ncomedian’s repertoire, of the many ways a computer could insist that you pay a bill, despite errors and \ndespite letters you might have written to complain. The act, which applies only to open-end credit and not \nto installment sales, sets out a procedure that creditors and customers must follow to rectify claimed \nerrors. The customer has sixty days to notify the creditor of the nature of the error and the amount. Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect. If you do turn out to be wrong, the creditor is entitled to all",

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

She notes that Mr. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1011 \nAnthony did not have custody of Meghan Rodgers and that an award of child support had not even been \nset at the time Ms. McCullough obtained her consumer report. \n \nDefendants maintain that Ms. McCullough obtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report for a permissible \npurpose, namely to locate Ms. Rodgers’ residence and set and collect child support obligations. \nDefendants argue that 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(a)(3)(A) permits the use of a credit report in connection with \n“collection of an account” and, therefore, Ms. McCullough was permitted to use Ms. Rodgers’ credit report \nin connection with the collection of child support. [1] \n \nThe cases Defendants have cited in response to the motion for summary judgment are inapplicable to the \npresent facts. In each case cited by Defendants, the person who obtained a credit report did so in order to \ncollect on an outstanding judgment or an outstanding debt. See, e.g., [Citation] (finding that collection of \na judgment of arrears in child support is a permissible purpose under [the act]; [Citation] (holding that \ndefendant had a permissible purpose for obtaining a consumer report where plaintiff owed an \noutstanding debt to the company). \n \nHowever, no such outstanding debt or judgment existed in this case. At the time Ms. McCullough \nobtained Ms. Rodgers’ consumer report, Ms. Rodgers’ did not owe money to either Ms. McCullough or her \nclient, Mr. Anthony. Defendants have provided no evidence showing that Ms. McCullough believed Ms. \nRodgers owed money to Mr. Anthony at the time she requested the credit report. Indeed, Mr. Anthony \nhad not even been awarded custody of Meghan Rodgers at the time Ms. McCullough obtained and used \nthe credit report. Ms. McCullough acknowledged each of the facts during her deposition. Moreover, in \nresponse to Plaintiff’s request for admissions, Ms. McCullough admitted that she did not receive the credit \nreport for the purpose of collecting on an account from Ms. Rodgers. \n \nThe evidence before the Court makes clear that Ms. McCullough was actually attempting, on behalf of Mr. \nAnthony, to secure custody of Meghan Rodgers and obtain a future award of child support payments from \nMs. Rodgers by portraying Ms. Rodgers as irresponsible to the court.

Why did the defendant, McCullough, order her secretary to obtain Ms. Rodgers’s credit report? If Ms. \nMcCullough is found liable, why would her law firm partners also be liable? \n2. What “permissible purpose” did the defendants contend they had for obtaining the credit report? Why did \nthe court determine that purpose was not permissible? \n3. Why did the court deny the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the question of whether the \ndefendant “willfully” failed to comply with the act?

Defendants \ndo not allege that these constitute permissible purposes under the FCRA. \n \n \n \n24.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nConsumers who are granted credit have long received protection through usury laws (laws that establish a \nmaximum interest rate). The rise in consumer debt in recent years has been matched by an increase in \nfederal regulation of consumer credit transactions. The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of credit \nterms; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits certain types of discrimination in the granting of credit; \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers access to their credit dossiers and prohibits unapproved \nuse of credit-rating information. After entering into a credit transaction, a consumer has certain \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1015 \ncancellation rights and may use a procedure prescribed by the Fair Credit Billing Act to correct billing \nerrors. Traditional debt collection practices—garnishment, wage assignments, and confession of judgment \nclauses—are now subject to federal regulation, as are the practices of collection agencies under the Fair \nDebt Collection Practices Act. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Carlene Consumer entered into an agreement with Rent to Buy, Inc., to rent a computer for $20 per week. \nThe agreement also provided that if Carlene chose to rent the computer for fifty consecutive weeks, she \nwould own it. She then asserted that the agreement was not a lease but a sale on credit subject to the \nTruth in Lending Act, and that Rent to Buy, Inc., violated the act by failing to state the annual percentage \nrate. Is Carlene correct? \n2. Carlos, a resident of Chicago, was on a road trip to California when he heard a noise under the hood of his \ncar. He took the car to a mechanic for repair. The mechanic overhauled the power steering unit and billed \nCarlos $600, which he charged on his credit card. Later that day—Carlos having driven about fifty miles—\nthe car made the same noise, and Carlos took it to another mechanic, who diagnosed the problem as a \nloose exhaust pipe connection at the manifold. Carlos was billed $300 for this repair, with which he was \nsatisfied. Carlos returned to Chicago and examined his credit card statement. What rights has he as to the \n$600 charge on his card? \n3. Ken was the owner of Scrimshaw, a company that manufactured and sold carvings made on fossilized ivory. \nHe applied for a loan from Bank. Bank found him creditworthy, but seeking additional security for \nrepayment, it required his wife, Linda, to sign a guaranty as well. During a subsequent recession, demand \nfor scrimshaw fell, and Ken’s business went under. Bank filed suit against both Ken and Linda. What defense \nhas Linda? \n4. The FCRA requires that credit-reporting agencies “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum \npossible accuracy of the information.” In October of 1989, Renie Guimond became aware of, and notified \nthe credit bureau Trans Union about, inaccuracies in her credit report: that she was married (and it listed a \nSocial Security number for this nonexistent spouse), that she was also known as Ruth Guimond, and that \nshe had a Saks Fifth Avenue credit card. About a month later, Trans Union responded to Guimond’s letter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1016 \nstating that the erroneous information had been removed. But in March of 1990, Trans Union again \npublished the erroneous information it purportedly had removed. Guimond then requested the source of \nthe erroneous information, to which Trans Union responded that it could not disclose the identity of the \nsource because it did not know its source. The disputed information was eventually removed from \nGuimond’s file in October 1990. When Guimond sued, Trans Union defended that she had no claim because \nno credit was denied to her as a result of the inaccuracies in her credit file. The lower court dismissed her \ncase; she appealed. To what damages, if any, is Guimond entitled? \n5. Plaintiff incurred a medical debt of $160.

A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate. \n \nBy Operation of Law \nSecurity obtained through operation of law is known as a lien. Derived from the French for “string” or \n“tie,” a lien is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or \ndischarge an obligation. \n \nIn this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship. In the next chapter, we \nlook at mortgages and nonconsensual liens. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1020 \n \nBasics of Secured Transactions \nThe law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can \nbe the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of \nthe security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that \nis, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) \nthe rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key \nterminology, we examine each of these components in turn. \nHere is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, \nsigns a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s \ndefault, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it. Figure 25.1 \n\"The Grasping Hand\" illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but \nthe hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults. \n \nFigure 25.1 The Grasping Hand \n \n \nSource of Law and Definitions \nSource of Law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1021 \nArticle 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property. The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods. Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on \ncredit at your college bookstore. The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1022 \nback a PMSI. In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book.",

A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book. \nWhether a transaction is a lease or a PMSI is an issue that frequently arises. The answer depends on the \nfacts of each case. However, a security interest is created if (1) the lessee is obligated to continue payments \nfor the term of the lease; (2) the lessee cannot terminate the obligation; and (3) one of several economic \ntests, which are listed in UCC Section 1-201 (37), is met. For example, one of the economic tests is that \n“the lessee has an option to become owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal \nadditional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.” \n \nThe issue of lease versus security interest gets litigated because of the requirements of Article 9 that a \nsecurity interest be perfected in certain ways (as we will see). If the transaction turns out to be a security \ninterest, a lessor who fails to meet these requirements runs the risk of losing his property to a third party. \nAnd consider this example. Ferrous Brothers Iron Works “leases” a $25,000 punch press to Millie’s \nMachine Shop. Under the terms of the lease, Millie’s must pay a yearly rental of $5,000 for five years, \nafter which time Millie’s may take title to the machine outright for the payment of $1. During the period of \nthe rental, title remains in Ferrous Brothers. Is this “lease” really a security interest? Since ownership \ncomes at nominal charge when the entire lease is satisfied, the transaction would be construed as one \ncreating a security interest. What difference does this make? Suppose Millie’s goes bankrupt in the third \nyear of the lease, and the trustee in bankruptcy wishes to sell the punch press to satisfy debts of the \nmachine shop. If it were a true lease, Ferrous Brothers would be entitled to reclaim the machine (unless \nthe trustee assumed the lease). But if the lease is really intended as a device to create a security interest, \nthen Ferrous Brothers can recover its collateral only if it has otherwise complied with the obligations of \nArticle 9—for example, by recording its security interest, as we will see. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1023 \nNow we return to definitions. \n \nDebtor is “a person (1) having an interest in the collateral other than a security interest or a lien; (2) a \nseller of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; or (3) a consignee.” [4] \nObligor is “a person that, with respect to an obligation secured by a security interest in or an agricultural \nlien on the collateral, (i) owes payment or other performance of the obligation, (ii) has provided property \nother than the collateral to secure payment or other performance of the obligation, or (iii) is otherwise \naccountable in whole or in part for payment or other performance of the obligation.” [5] Here is example 1 \nfrom the Official Comment to UCC Section 9-102: “Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security \ninterest in her Miata to secure the debt. Behnfeldt is a debtor and an obligor.” \n \nBehnfeldt is a debtor because she has an interest in the car—she owns it. She is an obligor because she \nowes payment to the creditor. Usually the debtor is the obligor. \n \nA secondary obligor is “an obligor to the extent that: (A) [the] obligation is secondary; or (b) [the person] \nhas a right of recourse with respect to an obligation secured by collateral against the debtor, another \nobligor, or property of either.” [6] The secondary obligor is a guarantor (surety) of the debt, obligated to \nperform if the primary obligor defaults. Consider example 2 from the Official Comment to Section 9-102: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money and grants a security interest in her Miata to secure the debt. Bruno cosigns a \nnegotiable note as maker. As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, \nBruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary \nobligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” \n \nAgain, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in \nher Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation. Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest",

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause.

The UCC, in Section 1-\n204, provides that \n \na person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them \n \n(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately \navailable credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in \nthe event of difficulties in collection; or \n \n(2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or \n \n(3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or \n \n(4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. \n \nSuppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000. She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a \nsecurity interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay. \nThat is sufficient value. \n \nDebtor’s Rights in Collateral \nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral. Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it). The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they \nmust be rights that can be conveyed. [22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own. \n \nSecurity Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor \nThe debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract. The UCC says that “the debtor \n[must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” \n“Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic \ncommercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1031 \nrecord…with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a \nrecord.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information \nelectronically stored or on paper. [23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common",

When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement. [32] \n \nDebtor Moves out of State \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1034 \nThe UCC also has rules for continued perfection of security interests when the debtor—whether an \nindividual or an association (corporation)—moves from one state to another. Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision. The most important category of exempt collateral \nis that covered by state certificate of title laws. For example, many states require automobile owners to \nobtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office. Most of these states provide that it is not \nnecessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile. The reason \nis that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone \nattempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the \nactual title certificate. [37] \n \nTemporary Perfection \nThe UCC provides that certain types of collateral are automatically perfected but only for a while: “A \nsecurity interest in certificated securities, or negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1035 \nfiling or the taking of possession for a period of twenty days from the time it attaches to the extent that it \narises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement.”[38] Similar temporary perfection \ncovers negotiable documents or goods in possession of a bailee, and when a security certificate or \ninstrument is delivered to the debtor for sale, exchange, presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or \nregistration. [39] After the twenty-day period, perfection would have to be by one of the other methods \nmentioned here. \n \nPerfection by Possession \nA secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable \ndocuments, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities. [40] This is a pledge \nof assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection). No security agreement is required for \nperfection by possession. \n \nA variation on the theme of pledge is field warehousing. When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes \npossession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera. But when large manufacturing concerns wish to \nborrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy. The bank does not \nwish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado. Bank employees \nperhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to \nemploy people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot. Thus this so-called field pledge \nis rare. \n \nMore common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to",

Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors \nPersons (including bankruptcy trustees) who become lien creditors before the security interest is \nperfected win out—the unperfected security interest is subordinate to lien creditors. Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees. Buyers in the ordinary course of business take free of a security \ninterest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.",

They have trained car-lock pickers, in-\nhouse locksmiths, experienced repossession teams, damage-free towing equipment, and the capacity to \ndeliver repossessed collateral to the client’s desired destination. Some firms advertise that they have 360-\ndegree video cameras that record every aspect of the repossession. They have “skip chasers”—people \nwhose business it is to track down those who skip out on their obligations, and they are trained not to \nbreach the peace. [1] See Pantoja-Cahue v. Ford Motor Credit Co., a case discussing repossession, \nin Section 25.5 \"Cases\". \nThe reference in Section 9-609(a)(2) to “render equipment unusable and dispose of collateral on a \ndebtor’s premises” gets to situations involving “heavy equipment [when] the physical removal from the \ndebtor’s plant and the storage of collateral pending disposition may be impractical or unduly \nexpensive.…Of course…all aspects of the disposition must be commercially reasonable.” [2]Rendering the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1050 \nequipment unusable would mean disassembling some critical part of the machine—letting it sit there until \nan auction is set up on the premises. \n \nThe creditor’s agents—the repo people—charge for their service, of course, and if possible the cost of \nrepossession comes out of the collateral when it’s sold. A debtor would be better off voluntarily delivering \nthe collateral according to the creditor’s instructions, but if that doesn’t happen, “self-help”—\nrepossession—is allowed because, of course, the debtor said it would be allowed in the security agreement, \nso long as the repossession can be accomplished without breach of peace. “Breach of peace” is language \nthat can cover a wide variety of situations over which courts do not always agree. For example, some \ncourts interpret a creditor’s taking of the collateral despite the debtor’s clear oral protest as a breach of the \npeace; other courts do not. \n \nDisposition after Repossession \nAfter repossession, the creditor has two options: sell the collateral or accept it in satisfaction of the debt \n(see Figure 25.5 \"Disposition after Repossession\"). \n \nFigure 25.5 Disposition after Repossession \n \nSale \nSale is the usual method of recovering the debt. Section 9-610 of the UCC permits the secured creditor to \n“sell, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its present condition or following \nany commercially reasonable preparation or processing.” The collateral may be sold as a whole or in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1051 \nparcels, at one time or at different times. Two requirements limit the creditor’s power to resell: (1) it must \nsend notice to the debtor and secondary obligor, and (unless consumer goods are sold) to other secured \nparties; and (2) all aspects of the sale must be “commercially reasonable.” [3] Most frequently the collateral \nis auctioned off. \n \nSection 9-615 of the UCC describes how the proceeds are applied: first, to the costs of the repossession, \nincluding reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses as provided for in the security agreement (and it \nwill provide for that!); second, to the satisfaction of the obligation owed; and third, to junior creditors. \nThis again emphasizes the importance of promptly perfecting the security interest: failure to do so \nfrequently subordinates the tardy creditor’s interest to junior status. If there is money left over from \ndisposing of the collateral—a surplus—the debtor gets that back. If there is still money owing—a \ndeficiency—the debtor is liable for that. In Section 9-616, the UCC carefully explains how the surplus or \ndeficiency is calculated; the explanation is required in a consumer goods transaction, and it has to be sent \nto the debtor after the disposition. \n \nStrict Foreclosure \nBecause resale can be a bother (or the collateral is appreciating in value), the secured creditor may wish \nsimply to accept the collateral in full satisfaction or partial satisfaction of the debt, as permitted in UCC \nSection 9-620(a). This is known as strict foreclosure. The debtor must consent to letting the creditor \ntake the collateral without a sale in a “record authenticated after default,” or after default the creditor can \nsend the debtor a proposal for the creditor to accept the collateral, and the proposal is effective if not \nobjected to within twenty days after it’s sent. \n \nThe strict foreclosure provisions contain a safety feature for consumer goods debtors. If the debtor has \npaid at least 60 percent of the debt, then the creditor may not use strict foreclosure—unless the debtor \nsigns a statement after default renouncing his right to bar strict foreclosure and to force a sale. [4] A \nconsumer who refuses to sign such a statement thus forces the secured creditor to sell the collateral under \nSection 9-610. Should the creditor fail to sell the goods within ninety days after taking possession of the",

Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000.

But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

The general principles of contract law apply to suretyship. \nThus a person with the general capacity to contract has the power to become a surety. Consideration is \nrequired for a suretyship contract: if Debtor asks a friend to act as a surety to induce Creditor to make \nDebtor a loan, the consideration Debtor gives Creditor also acts as the consideration Friend gives. Where \nthe suretyship arises after Creditor has already extended credit, new consideration would be required \n(absent application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel [1]). You may recall from the chapters on \ncontracts that the promise by one person to pay or perform for the debts or defaults of another must be \nevidenced by a writing under the statute of frauds (subject to the “main purpose” exception). \n \nSuretyship contracts are affected to some extent by government regulation. Under a 1985 Federal Trade \nCommission Credit Practices Rule, creditors are prohibited from misrepresenting a surety’s liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1057 \nCreditors must also give the surety a notice that explains the nature of the obligation and the potential \nliability that can arise if a person cosigns on another’s debt. [2] \n \nDuties and Rights of the Surety \nDuties of the Surety \nUpon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal \nherself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation. When the surety performs, it must do so in \ngood faith. Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—\nthe surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in \nbad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really \ndefaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making \nunreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project. The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of \nMaryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co.,in Section 25.5 \"Cases\", is typical. \n \nRights of the Surety \nThe surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the \nprincipal debtor. \n \n \n \nExoneration \nIf, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do \nso, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform. It would be \ninequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if \nall along the principal is able to perform. \n \nReimbursement \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1058 \nIf the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to \nreimburse the surety. The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith \noutlays, including interest and legal fees. \n \nSubrogation \nSuppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this \nsatisfaction. Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal. \nIn other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever \nrights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged. The right \nof subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal \nto cover the duty. Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha has taken a security interest in \nSarah’s Chevrolet. Eva is surety for the debt. Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000. Eva is \nentitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her. \n \nContribution \nTwo or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between \nthem the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties. A surety who in performing its own \nobligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution \nfrom the cosureties. \n \n \n \nDefenses of the Parties \nThe principal and the surety may have defenses to paying. \n \nDefenses of the Principal",

However, the \nsurety may contract with the creditor to be liable despite the principal’s defenses, and a surety who has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1059 \nundertaken the suretyship with knowledge of the creditor’s fraud or duress remains obligated, even \nthough the principal debtor will be discharged. When the surety turns to the principal debtor and \ndemands reimbursement, the latter may have defenses against the surety—as noted—for acting in bad \nfaith. \n \nOne of the main reasons creditors want the promise of a surety is to avoid the risk that the principal \ndebtor will go bankrupt: the debtor’s bankruptcy is a defense to the debtor’s liability, certainly, but that \ndefense cannot be used by the surety. The same is true of the debtor’s incapacity: it is a defense available \nto the principal debtor but not to the surety. \n \nDefenses of the Surety \nGenerally, the surety may exercise defenses on a contract that would have been available to the principal \ndebtor (e.g., creditor’s breach; impossibility or illegality of performance; fraud, duress, or \nmisrepresentation by creditor; statute of limitations; refusal of creditor to accept tender or performance \nfrom either debtor or surety.) Beyond that, the surety has some defenses of its own. Common defenses \nraised by sureties include the following: \n \n• \nRelease of the principal. Whenever a creditor releases the principal, the surety is discharged, \nunless the surety consents to remain liable or the creditor expressly reserves her rights against the \nsurety. The creditor’s release of the surety, though, does not release the principal debtor because \nthe debtor is liable without regard to the surety’s liability. \n• \nModification of the contract. If the creditor alters the instrument sufficiently to discharge the \nprincipal, the surety is discharged as well. Likewise, when the creditor and principal modify their \ncontract, a surety who has not consented to the modification is discharged if the surety’s risk is \nmaterially increased (but not if it is decreased). Modifications include extension of the time of \npayment, release of collateral (this releases the surety to the extent of the impairment), change in \nprincipal debtor’s duties, and assignment or delegation of the debtor’s obligations to a third party. \nThe surety may consent to modifications. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1060 \n• \nCreditor’s failure to perfect. A creditor who fails to file a financing statement or record a \nmortgage risks losing the security for the loan and might also inadvertently release a surety, but \nthe failure of the creditor to resort first to collateral is no defense. \n• \nStatute of frauds. Suretyship contracts are among those required to be evidenced by some writing \nunder the statute of frauds, and failure to do so may discharge the surety from liability. \n• \nCreditor’s failure to inform surety of material facts within creditor’s knowledge affecting \ndebtor’s ability to perform (e.g., that debtor has defaulted several times before). \n• \nGeneral contract defenses. The surety may raise common defenses like incapacity (infancy), lack \nof consideration (unless promissory estoppel can be substituted or unless no separate \nconsideration is necessary because the surety’s and debtor’s obligations arise at the same time), \nand creditor’s fraud or duress on surety. However, fraud by the principal debtor on the surety to \ninduce the suretyship will not release the surety if the creditor extended credit in good faith; if the \ncreditor knows of the fraud perpetrated by the debtor on the surety, the surety may avoid liability. \nSee Figure 25.6 \"Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety\". \n \nThe following are defenses of principal debtor only: \n \n• \nDeath or incapacity of principal debtor \n• \nBankruptcy of principal debtor \n• \nPrincipal debtor’s setoffs against creditor \n \nThe following are defenses of both principal debtor and surety: \n \n• \nMaterial breach by creditor \n• \nLack of mutual assent, failure of consideration \n• \nCreditor’s fraud, duress, or misrepresentation of debtor \n• \nImpossibility or illegality of performance \n•",

[Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the \nplaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession. So long as the \nentry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, \nbuildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his \nproperty.” \n \n…[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking \ninto the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other \nbarriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1069 \nDavenport v. Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of \nsection 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if \nthe repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or locked garage.’”…This is so \nbecause “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free \nright of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as \nseriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenport held that the creditor’s \nrepossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from \nremoving the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical \nconfrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession \noccurred).Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of \ncollateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced \nagainst the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and \nprivacy interests. \n \n“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to \nresolve disputes. Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in \na way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged \nbecause of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].",

Article 9 lumps together all the former types of security devices, including the pledge, chattel \nmortgage, and conditional sale. \nFive types of tangible property may serve as collateral: (1) consumer goods, (2) equipment, (3) farm \nproducts, (4) inventory, and (5) fixtures. Five types of intangibles may serve as collateral: (1) accounts, (2) \ngeneral intangibles (e.g., patents), (3) documents of title, (4) chattel paper, and (5) instruments. Article 9 \nexpressly permits the debtor to give a security interest in after-acquired collateral. \n \nTo create an enforceable security interest, the lender and borrower must enter into an agreement \nestablishing the interest, and the lender must follow steps to ensure that the security interest first attaches \nand then is perfected. There are three general requirements for attachment: (1) there must be an \nauthenticated agreement (or the collateral must physically be in the lender’s possession), (2) the lender \nmust have given value, and (3) the debtor must have some rights in the collateral. Once the interest \nattaches, the lender has rights in the collateral superior to those of unsecured creditors. But others may \ndefeat his interest unless he perfects the security interest. The three common ways of doing so are (1) \nfiling a financing statement, (2) pledging collateral, and (3) taking a purchase-money security interest \n(PMSI) in consumer goods. \n \nA financing statement is a simple notice, showing the parties’ names and addresses, the signature of the \ndebtor, and an adequate description of the collateral. The financing statement, effective for five years, \nmust be filed in a public office; the location of the office varies among the states. \n \nSecurity interests in instruments and negotiable documents can be perfected only by the secured party’s \ntaking possession, with twenty-one-day grace periods applicable under certain circumstances. Goods may \nalso be secured through pledging, which is often done through field warehousing. If a seller of consumer \ngoods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection is automatic and no filing is required, although the \nlender may file and probably should, to avoid losing seniority to a bona fide purchaser of consumer goods \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1075 \nwithout knowledge of the security interest, if the goods are used for personal, family, or household \npurposes. \n \nThe general priority rule is “first in time, first in right.” Priority dates from the earlier of two events: (1) \nfiling a financing statement covering the collateral or (2) other perfection of the security interest. Several \nexceptions to this rule arise when creditors take a PMSI, among them, when a buyer in the ordinary \ncourse of business takes free of a security interest created by the seller. \n \nOn default, a creditor may repossess the collateral. For the most part, self-help private repossession \ncontinues to be lawful but risky. After repossession, the lender may sell the collateral or accept it in \nsatisfaction of the debt. Any excess in the selling price above the debt amount must go to the debtor. \n \nSuretyship is a legal relationship that is created when one person contracts to be responsible for the \nproper fulfillment of another’s obligation, in case the latter (the principal debtor) fails to fulfill it. The \nsurety may avail itself of the principal’s contract defenses, but under various circumstances, defenses may \nbe available to the one that are not available to the other. One general defense often raised by sureties is \nalteration of the contract. If the surety is required to perform, it has rights for reimbursement against the \nprincipal, including interest and legal fees; and if there is more than one surety, each standing for part of \nthe obligation, one who pays a disproportionate part may seek contribution from the others. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nKathy Knittle borrowed $20,000 from Bank to buy inventory to sell in her knit shop and signed a security \nagreement listing as collateral the entire present and future inventory in the shop, including proceeds",

            "chunk": "Creation of the Mortgage \nStatutory Regulation \nThe decision whether to lend money and take a mortgage is affected by several federal and state \nregulations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1083 \nConsumer Credit Statutes Apply \nStatutes dealing with consumer credit transactions (as discussed in Chapter 24 \"Consumer Credit \nTransactions\") have a bearing on the mortgage, including state usury statutes, and the federal Truth in \nLending Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. \n \nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act \nOther federal statutes are directed more specifically at mortgage lending. One, enacted in 1974, is the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of \nobtaining the mortgage and purchasing a residence. The act covers all federally related first mortgage \nloans secured by residential properties for one to four families. It requires the lender to disclose \ninformation about settlement costs in advance of the closing day: it prohibits the lender from “springing” \nunexpected or hidden costs onto the borrower. The RESPA is a US Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) consumer protection statute designed to help home buyers be better shoppers in the \nhome-buying process, and it is enforced by HUD. It also outlaws what had been a common practice of \ngiving and accepting kickbacks and referral fees. The act prohibits lenders from requiring mortgagors to \nuse a particular company to obtain insurance, and it limits add-on fees the lender can demand to cover \nfuture insurance and tax charges. \n \nRedlining. Several statutes are directed to the practice of redlining—the refusal of lenders to make loans \non property in low-income neighborhoods or impose stricter mortgage terms when they do make loans \nthere. (The term derives from the supposition that lenders draw red lines on maps around ostensibly \nmarginal neighborhoods.) The most important of these is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of \n1977. [1] The act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated \nfinancial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation. To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine \nbanking institutions for CRA compliance and take this information into consideration when approving \napplications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions. The information is compiled under the \nauthority of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions within its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1084 \npurview to report annually by transmitting information from their loan application registers to a federal \nagency. \n \nThe Note and the Mortgage Documents \nThe note and the mortgage documents are the contracts that set up the deal: the mortgagor gets credit, \nand the mortgagee gets the right to repossess the property in case of default. \n \nThe Note \nIf the lender decides to grant a mortgage, the mortgagor signs two critical documents at the closing: the \nnote and the mortgage. We cover notes in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\". It is \nenough here to recall that in a note (really a type of IOU), the mortgagor promises to pay a specified \nprincipal sum, plus interest, by a certain date or dates. The note is the underlying obligation for which the \nmortgage serves as security. Without the note, the mortgagee would have an empty document, since the \nmortgage would secure nothing. Without a mortgage, a note is still quite valid, evidencing the debtor’s \npersonal obligation. \n \nOne particular provision that usually appears in both mortgages and the underlying notes is \nthe acceleration clause. This provides that if a debtor should default on any particular payment, the \nentire principal and interest will become due immediately at the lender’s option. Why an acceleration \nclause? Without it, the lender would be powerless to foreclose the entire mortgage when the mortgagor \ndefaulted but would have to wait until the expiration of the note’s term. Although the acceleration clause \nis routine, it will not be enforced unless the mortgagee acts in an equitable and fair manner. The problem \narises where the mortgagor’s default was the result of some unconscionable conduct of the mortgagee, \nsuch as representing to the mortgagee that she might take a sixty-day “holiday” from having to make \npayments. In Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group (Section 26.4 \"Cases\"), the equitable \npowers of the court were invoked to prevent acceleration. \n \nThe Mortgage \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1085 \nUnder the statute of frauds, the mortgage itself must be evidenced by some writing to be enforceable. The \nmortgagor will usually make certain promises and warranties to the mortgagee and state the amount and \nterms of the debt and the mortgagor’s duties concerning taxes, insurance, and repairs.

            "chunk": "interests in fixtures if certain requirements are met. \n \nFuture Advances \nA bank might make advances to the debtor after accepting the mortgage. If the future advances are \nobligatory, then the first-in-time rule applies. For example: Bank accepts Debtor’s mortgage (and records \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1088 \nit) and extends a line of credit on which Debtor draws, up to a certain limit. (Or, as in the construction \nindustry, Bank might make periodic advances to the contractors as work progresses, backed by the \nmortgage.) Second Creditor loans Debtor money—secured by the same property—before Debtor began to \ndraw against the first line of credit. Bank has priority: by searching the mortgage records, Second Creditor \nshould have been on notice that the first mortgage was intended as security for the entire line of credit, \nalthough the line was doled out over time. \n \nHowever, if the future advances are not obligatory, then priority is determined by notice. For example, a \nbank might take a mortgage as security for an original loan and for any future loans that the bank chooses \nto make. A later creditor can achieve priority by notifying the bank with the first mortgage that it is \nmaking an advance. Suppose Jimmy mortgages his property to a wealthy dowager, Mrs. Calabash, in \nreturn for an immediate loan of $20,000 and they agree that the mortgage will serve as security for future \nloans to be arranged. The mortgage is recorded. A month later, before Mrs. Calabash loans him any more \nmoney, Jimmy gives a second mortgage to Louella in return for a loan of $10,000. Louella notifies Mrs. \nCalabash that she is loaning Jimmy the money. A month later, Mrs. Calabash loans Jimmy another \n$20,000. Jimmy then defaults, and the property turns out to be worth only $40,000. Whose claims will \nbe honored and in what order? Mrs. Calabash will collect her original $20,000, because it was recited in \nthe mortgage and the mortgage was recorded. Louella will collect her $10,000 next, because she notified \nthe first mortgage holder of the advance. That leaves Mrs. Calabash in third position to collect what she \ncan of her second advance. Mrs. Calabash could have protected herself by refusing the second loan. \n \nTermination of the Mortgage \nThe mortgagor’s liability can terminate in three ways: payment, assumption (with a novation), or \nforeclosure. \n \nPayment \nUnless they live in the home for twenty-five or thirty years, the mortgagors usually pay off the mortgage \nwhen the property is sold. Occasionally, mortgages are paid off in order to refinance. If the mortgage was \ntaken out at a time of high interest rates and rates later drop, the homeowner might want to obtain a new \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1089 \nmortgage at the lower rates. In many mortgages, however, this entails extra closing costs and penalties for \nprepaying the original mortgage. Whatever the reason, when a mortgage is paid off, the discharge should \nbe recorded. This is accomplished by giving the mortgagor a copy of, and filing a copy of, a Satisfaction of \nMortgage document. In the Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group case (Section 26.4 \n\"Cases\"), the bank mistakenly filed the Satisfaction of Mortgage document, later discovered its mistake, \nretracted the satisfaction, accelerated the loan because the mortgagor stopped making payments (the \nbank, seeing no record of an outstanding mortgage, refused to accept payments), and then tried to \nforeclose on the mortgage, meanwhile having lost the note and mortgage besides. \n \n \nAssumption \nThe property can be sold without paying off the mortgage if the mortgage is assumed by the new buyer, \nwho agrees to pay the seller’s (the original mortgagor’s) debt. This is a novation if, in approving the \nassumption, the bank releases the old mortgagor and substitutes the buyer as the new debtor. \n \nThe buyer need not assume the mortgage. If the buyer purchases the property without agreeing to be \npersonally liable, this is a sale “subject to” the mortgage (see Figure 26.3 \"“Subject to” Sales versus \nAssumption\"). In the event of the seller’s subsequent default, the bank can foreclose the mortgage and sell \nthe property that the buyer has purchased, but the buyer is not liable for any deficiency. \n \nFigure 26.3 “Subject to” Sales versus Assumption \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1090 \n \n \nWhat if mortgage rates are high? Can buyers assume an existing low-rate mortgage from the seller rather \nthan be forced to obtain a new mortgage at substantially higher rates? Banks, of course, would prefer not \nto allow that when interest rates are rising, so they often include in the mortgage a due-on-sale clause, \nby which the entire principal and interest become due when the property is sold, thus forcing the \npurchaser to get financing at the higher rates. The clause is a device for preventing subsequent purchasers \nfrom assuming loans with lower-than-market interest rates. Although many state courts at one time",

Banks, of course, would prefer not \nto allow that when interest rates are rising, so they often include in the mortgage a due-on-sale clause, \nby which the entire principal and interest become due when the property is sold, thus forcing the \npurchaser to get financing at the higher rates. The clause is a device for preventing subsequent purchasers \nfrom assuming loans with lower-than-market interest rates. Although many state courts at one time \nrefused to enforce the due-on-sale clause, Congress reversed this trend when it enacted the Garn–St. \nGermain Depository Institutions Act in 1982. [1]The act preempts state laws and upholds the validity of \ndue-on-sale clauses. When interest rates are low, banks have no interest in enforcing such clauses, and \nthere are ways to work around the due-on-sale clause. \n \nForeclosure \nThe third method of terminating the mortgage is by foreclosure when a mortgagor defaults. Even after \ndefault, the mortgagor has the right to exercise his equity of redemption—that is, to redeem the property \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1091 \nby paying the principal and interest in full. If he does not, the mortgagee may foreclose the equity of \nredemption. Although strict foreclosure is used occasionally, in most cases the mortgagee forecloses by \none of two types of sale (see Figure 26.4 \"Foreclosure\"). \n \nThe first type is judicial sale. The mortgagee seeks a court order authorizing the sale to be conducted by \na public official, usually the sheriff. The mortgagor is entitled to be notified of the proceeding and to a \nhearing. The second type of sale is that conducted under a clause called a power of sale, which many \nlenders insist be contained in the mortgage. This clause permits the mortgagee to sell the property at \npublic auction without first going to court—although by custom or law, the sale must be advertised, and \ntypically a sheriff or other public official conducts the public sale or auction. \n \n \n \nFigure 26.4 Foreclosure \n \n \nOnce the property has been sold, it is deeded to the new purchaser. In about half the states, the mortgagor \nstill has the right to redeem the property by paying up within six months or a year—the statutory \nredemption period. Thereafter, the mortgagor has no further right to redeem. If the sale proceeds exceed \nthe debt, the mortgagor is entitled to the excess unless he has given second and third mortgages, in which \ncase the junior mortgagees are entitled to recover their claims before the mortgagor. If the proceeds are \nless than the debt, the mortgagee is entitled to recover the deficiency from the mortgagor. However, some \nstates have statutorily abolished deficiency judgments. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1092 \n \nOther Methods of Using Real Estate as Security \nBesides the mortgage, there are other ways to use real estate as security. Here we take up two: the deed of \ntrust and the installment or land contract. \n \nDeed of Trust \nThe deed of trust is a device for securing a debt with real property; unlike the mortgage, it requires three \nparties: the borrower, the trustee, and the lender. Otherwise, it is at base identical to a mortgage. The \nborrower conveys the land to a third party, the trustee, to hold in trust for the lender until the borrower \npays the debt. (The trustee’s interest is really a kind of legal fiction: that person is expected to have no \ninterest in the property.) The primary benefit to the deed of trust is that it simplifies the foreclosure \nprocess by containing a provision empowering the trustee to sell the property on default, thus doing away \nwith the need for any court filings. The disinterested third party making sure things are done properly \nbecomes the trustee, not a judge. In thirty states and the District of Columbia—more than half of US \njurisdictions—the deed of trust is usually used in lieu of mortgages. [2] \n \nBut the deed of trust may have certain disadvantages as well. For example, when the debt has been fully \npaid, the trustee will not release the deed of trust until she sees that all notes secured by it have been \nmarked canceled. Should the borrower have misplaced the canceled notes or failed to keep good records, \nhe will need to procure a surety bond to protect the trustee in case of a mistake. This can be an expensive \nprocedure. In many jurisdictions, the mortgage holder is prohibited from seeking a deficiency judgment if \nthe holder chooses to sell the property through nonjudicial means. \n \nAlpha Imperial Building, LLC v. Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, Section 26.4 \"Cases\", discusses \nseveral issues involving deeds of trust. \n \nInstallment or Land Contract \nUnder the installment contract or land contract, the purchaser takes possession and agrees to pay",

Understand the nonconsensual liens issued by courts—attachment liens and judgment liens—and how they \nare created. \n2. Recognize other types of nonconsensual liens: mechanic’s lien, possessory lien, and tax lien. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1095 \nThe security arrangements discussed so far—security interests, suretyship, mortgages—are all \nobtained by the creditor with the debtor’s consent. A creditor may obtain certain liens without the \ndebtor’s consent. \n \nCourt-Decreed Liens \nSome nonconsensual liens are issued by courts. \n \nAttachment Lien \nAn attachment lien is ordered against a person’s property—real or personal—to prevent him from \ndisposing of it during a lawsuit. To obtain an attachment lien, the plaintiff must show that the defendant \nlikely will dispose of or hide his property; if the court agrees with the plaintiff, she must post a bond and \nthe court will issue a writ of attachment to the sheriff, directing the sheriff to seize the property. \nAttachments of real property should be recorded. Should the plaintiff win her suit, the court issues a writ \nof execution, directing the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment. \n \nJudgment Lien \nA judgment lien may be issued when a plaintiff wins a judgment in court if an attachment lien has not \nalready been issued. Like the attachment lien, it provides a method by which the defendant’s property \nmay be seized and sold. \n \nMechanic’s Lien \nOverview \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on real estate is the mechanic’s lien. A mechanic’s lien can be \nobtained by one who furnishes labor, services, or materials to improve real estate: this is statutory, and \nthe statute must be carefully followed. The “mechanic” here is one who works with his or her hands, not \nspecifically one who works on machines. An automobile mechanic could not obtain a mechanic’s lien on a \ncustomer’s house to secure payment of work he did on her car. (The lien to which the automobile \nmechanic is entitled is a “possessory lien” or “artisan’s lien,” considered in Section 26.3.3 \"Possessory \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1096 \nLien\") To qualify for a mechanic’s lien, the claimant must file a sworn statement describing the work \ndone, the contract made, or the materials furnished that permanently improved the real estate. \n \nA particularly difficult problem crops up when the owner has paid the contractor, who in turn fails to pay \nhis subcontractors. In many states, the subcontractors can file a lien on the owner’s property, thus forcing \nthe owner to pay them (see Figure 26.5 \"Subcontractors’ Lien\")—and maybe twice. To protect themselves, \nowners can demand a sworn statement from general contractors listing the subcontractors used on the \njob, and from them, owners can obtain a waiver of lien rights before paying the general contractor. \n \nFigure 26.5 Subcontractors’ Lien \n \n \nProcedure for Obtaining a Mechanic’s Lien \nAnyone claiming a lien against real estate must record a lien statement stating the amount due and the \nnature of the improvement. The lienor has a specified period of time (e.g., ninety days) to file from the \ntime the work is finished. Recording as such does not give the lienor an automatic right to the property if \nthe debt remains unpaid. All states specify a limited period of time, usually one year, within which the \nclaimant must file suit to enforce the lien. Only if the court decides the lien is valid may the property be \nsold to satisfy the debt. Difficult questions sometimes arise when a lien is filed against a landlord’s \nproperty as a result of improvements and services provided to a tenant, as discussed in F & D Elec. \nContractors, Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc.,Section 26.4 \"Cases\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1097 \n \nMechanic’s Liens Priorities \nA mechanic’s lien represents a special risk to the purchaser of real estate or to lenders who wish to take a \nmortgage. In most states, the mechanic’s lien is given priority not from the date when the lien is recorded \nbut from an earlier date—either the date the contractor was hired or the date construction began. Thus a \npurchaser or lender might lose priority to a creditor with a mechanic’s lien who filed after the sale or \nmortgage. A practical solution to this problem is to hold back part of the funds (purchase price or loan) or \nplace them in escrow until the period for recording liens has expired. \n \nPossessory Lien \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate) is the possessory lien. \nThis is the right to continue to keep the goods on which work has been performed or for which materials",

Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note. [Citation.] \n \nChase may, therefore, recover the entire amount of the mortgage indebtedness, unless the court finds a \n“limited circumstance” upon which the request may be denied. [Citation.] Although not presented by \nChase in its discussion of this case, the Court may refuse foreclosure, notwithstanding that the defendant \nestablished a foreclosure action, if the acceleration was unconscionable and the “result would be \ninequitable and unjust.” This Court will analyze the inequitable result test and the limited circumstances \nby which the court may deny foreclosure. \n \nFirst, this Court does not find the mortgage acceleration unconscionable by assuming arguendo [for the \npurposes of argument] that the mortgage was valid during the period that the Satisfaction of Mortgage \nwas entered into the public records. Chase did not send the first acceleration warning until November 14, \n2000, the fourth month of non-payment, followed by the second acceleration letter on March 16, 2001, \nthe eighth month of non-payment. Although Cherry could have argued that a foreclosure action was an \n“inequitable” and “unjust” result after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered on his behalf, the result \ndoes not rise to an unconscionable level since Cherry could have properly tendered the mortgage \npayments to the court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1102 \nSecond, the following “limited circumstances” will justify a court’s denial of foreclosure: 1) waiver of right \nto accelerate; 2) mortgagee estopped from asserting foreclosure because mortgagor reasonably assumed \nthe mortgagee would not foreclose; 3) mortgagee failed to perform a condition precedent for acceleration; \n4) payment made after default but prior to receiving intent to foreclose; or, 5) where there was intent to \nmake to make timely payment, and it was attempted, or steps taken to accomplish it, but nevertheless the \npayment was not made due to a misunderstanding or excusable neglect, coupled with some conduct of the \nmortgagee which in a measure contributed to the failure to pay when due or within the grace period. \n[Citations.] \n \nChase fails to address this fifth circumstance in its motion, an apparent obfuscation of the case law before \nthe court. This Court acknowledges that Cherry’s facts do not satisfy the first four limited circumstances. \nChase at no time advised Cherry that the acceleration right was being waived; nor is Chase estopped from \nasserting foreclosure on the mortgage because of the administrative error, and Cherry has not relied on \nthis error to his detriment; and since Chase sent the acceleration letter to Cherry and a request for \npayment to his attorney, there can be no argument that Cherry believed Chase would not foreclose. Chase \nhas performed all conditions precedent required by the mortgage provisions prior to notice of the \nacceleration; sending acceleration warnings on November 17, 2000, and March 16, 2001. Cherry also has \nno argument for lack of notice of intent to accelerate after default since he has not tendered a payment \nsince July 2000, thus placing him in default of the mortgage provisions, and he admits receiving the \nacceleration notices. \n \nThis Court finds, however, that this claim fails squarely into the final limited circumstance regarding \nintent to make timely payments. Significant factual issues exist as to the intent of Cherry to make or \nattempt to make timely mortgage payments to Chase. Cherry claims that he attempted to make the \npayments, but was told by a representative of Chase that there was no mortgage loan number upon which \nto apply the payments. As a result, the mortgage payments were placed into an account and later into his \ncounsel’s trust account as a mortgage escrow. Although these payments should have, at a minimum, been \nplaced with the court to ensure tender during the resolution of the mortgage dispute, Cherry did take \nsteps to accomplish timely mortgage payments. Although Cherry, through excusable neglect or a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1103 \nmisunderstanding as to what his rights were after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered, failed to \ntender the payments, Chase is also not without fault; its conduct in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage \ninto the Pinellas County public records directly contributed to Cherry’s failure to tender timely payments.",

Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003. The lawsuit asked \nfor declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages. The trial court granted the defendants’ summary \njudgment motion on August 8, 2003. Alpha appeals. \n \nLocation of the Sale \n \nAlpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the \nAdministration Building. Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are \nheld at the Administration Building. The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders \nand trustees to that location if asked. In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a \n‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there. We disagree. Alpha \nhas not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location. The evidence shows that the \ncounty had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect. \nHowever, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from \nbeing held there. Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent.

To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent. Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who \nmight bid on the property] that a full credit sale price was expected and that the opening bid would be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1115 \n$4.1 million did not constitute intentional chilling. SFI was owed $4.1 million on the Property. SFI could \nthus bid up to that amount at no cost to itself, as the proceeds would go back to SFI. Currin confirmed that \nSFI was prepared to make a full-credit bid. [It is common for trustees to] disclose the full-credit bid \namount to potential third party bidders, and for investors to lose interest when they learn of the amount \nof indebtedness on property. It was therefore not a misrepresentation for Currin to state $4.1 million as \nthe opening bid, due to the indebtedness on the Property. Currin’s statements had no chilling effect—they \nmerely informed [interested persons] of the minimum amount necessary to prevail against SFI. Thus, \nCurrin did not intentionally chill the bidding by giving Street that information. \n \nAlpha also argues that the chilled bidding could have been unintended by Currin.… [But the evidence is \nthat] Currin’s actions did not intentionally or unintentionally chill the bidding, and the sale will not be set \naside. \n \nAdequacy of the Sale Price \nAlpha claims that the sale price was ‘greatly inadequate’ and that the sale should thus be set aside. Alpha \nsubmitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an \nestimated 2004 value of $5.2 million. The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million. SFI bought \nthe property for $2.1 million. These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside. \n \nWashington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a \ntrustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone. In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth \nbetween $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873. The Court held that \namount to be grossly inadequate In Steward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for \napproximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870. This court \nheld that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate. In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for \nless than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate. The Court \nin Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase \nprice; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than \nthree percent of the value. In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1116 \nthe sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 \npercent will not be set aside. [Citation.] The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value. \nThese facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price. \n \nAlpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set \naside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here. However, \nthe cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than \nthree and four percent of their value. Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor \nshown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price. \n \nDuty to a Junior Lienholder \nAlpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder. Alpha cites no case law for this \nproposition, and, indeed, there is none—Division Two specifically declined to decide this issue in Country \nExpress [Citation]. Alpha acknowledges the lack of language in RCW 61.24 (the deed of trust statute) \nregarding fiduciary duties of trustees to junior lienholders. But Alpha argues that since RCW 61.24 \nrequires that the trustee follow certain procedures in conducting the sale, and allows for sales to be \nrestrained by anyone with an interest, a substantive duty from the trustee to a junior lienholder can be \ninferred. \n \nAlpha’s arguments are unavailing.

Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

            "chunk": "debtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate. We begin with the rules \ngoverning proof of claims by creditors and the priority of their claims. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1131 \n \nClaims and Creditors \nA claim is defined as a right to payment, whether or not it is reduced to judgment, liquidated, \nunliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or \nunsecured. A creditor is defined as a person or entity with a claim that arose no later than when the court \nissues the order for relief. These are very broad definitions, intended to give the debtor the broadest \npossible relief when finally discharged. \n \nProof of Claims \nBefore the trustee can distribute proceeds of the estate, unsecured creditors must file a proof of claim, \nprima facie evidence that they are owed some amount of money. They must do so within six months after \nthe first date set for the first meeting of creditors. A creditor’s claim is disallowed, even though it is valid, \nif it is not filed in a timely manner. A party in interest, such as the trustee or creditor, may object to a \nproof of claim, in which case the court must determine whether to allow it. In the absence of objection, the \nclaim is “deemed allowed.” The court will not allow some claims. These include unenforceable claims, \nclaims for unmatured interest, claims that may be offset by debts the creditor owes the debtor, and \nunreasonable charges by an insider or an attorney. If it’s a “no asset” bankruptcy—most are—creditors are \nin effect told by the court not to waste their time filing proof of claim. \n \nClaims with Priority \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priorities among them. The law is \ncomplex because it sets up different orders of priorities. \n \nFirst, secured creditors get their security interests before anyone else is satisfied, because the security \ninterest is not part of the property that the trustee is entitled to bring into the estate. This is why being a \nsecured creditor is important (as discussed in Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and \nSuretyship\"and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens\"). To the extent that secured creditors \nhave claims in excess of their collateral, they are considered unsecured or general creditors and are \nlumped in with general creditors of the appropriate class. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1132 \n \nSecond, of the six classes of claimants (see Figure 27.3 \"Distribution of the Estate\"), the first is known as \nthat of “priority claims.” It is subdivided into ten categories ranked in order of priority. The highest-\npriority class within the general class of priority claims must be paid off in full before the next class can \nshare in a distribution from the estate, and so on. Within each class, members will share pro rata if there \nare not enough assets to satisfy everyone fully. The priority classes, from highest to lowest, are set out in \nthe bankruptcy code (11 USC Section 507) as follows: \n \n(1) Domestic support obligations (“DSO”), which are claims for support due to the spouse, former \nspouse, child, or child’s representative, and at a lower priority within this class are any claims by \na governmental unit that has rendered support assistance to the debtor’s family obligations. \n \n(2) Administrative expenses that are required to administer the bankruptcy case itself. Under \nformer law, administrative expenses had the highest priority, but Congress elevated domestic \nsupport obligations above administrative expenses with the passage of the BAPCPA. Actually, \nthough, administrative expenses have a de facto priority over domestic support obligations, \nbecause such expenses are deducted before they are paid to DSO recipients. Since trustees are \npaid from the bankruptcy estate, the courts have allowed de facto top priority for administrative \nexpenses because no trustee is going to administer a bankruptcy case for nothing (and no lawyer \nwill work for long without getting paid, either). \n \n(3) Gap creditors. Claims made by gap creditors in an involuntary bankruptcy petition under \nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 are those that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy \npetition and the order for relief issued by the court. These claims are given priority because \notherwise creditors would not deal with the debtor, usually a business, when the business has \ndeclared bankruptcy but no trustee has been appointed and no order of relief issued. \n \n(4) Employee wages up to $10,950 for each worker, for the 180 days previous to either the \nbankruptcy filing or when the business ceased operations, whichever is earlier (180-day period). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1133",

Outside of bankruptcy, taxes usually have a higher priority than this, which is why \nmany times creditors—not tax creditors—file an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the \ndebtor so that they have a higher priority in bankruptcy than they would outside it. \n \n(9) Allowed claims based on any commitment by the debtor to a federal depository institution to \nmaintain the capital of an insured depository institution. \n \n(10) Claims for death or personal injury from a motor vehicle or vessel that occurred while the \ndebtor was legally intoxicated. \n \nThird through sixth (after secured creditors and priority claimants), other claimants are attended to, but \nnot immediately. The bankruptcy code (perhaps somewhat awkwardly) deals with who gets paid when in \nmore than one place. Chapter 5 sets out priority claims as just noted; that order applies \nto allbankruptcies. Chapter 7, dealing with liquidation (as opposed to Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, wherein \nthe debtor pays most of her debt), then lists the order ofdistribution. Section 726 of 11 United States Code \nprovides: “Distribution of property of the estate. (1) First, in payment of claims of the kind specified in, \nand in the order specified in section 507…” (again, the priority of claims just set out). Following the order \nspecified in the bankruptcy code, our discussion of the order of distribution is taken up in Section 27.3 \n\"Chapter 7 Liquidation\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1134 \n \n \n \nDebtor's Duties and Exemptions \nThe act imposes certain duties on the debtor, and it exempts some property that the trustee can \naccumulate and distribute from the estate. \n \nDebtor’s Duties \nThe debtor, reasonably enough, is supposed to file a list of creditors, assets, liabilities, and current \nincome, and a statement of financial affairs. The debtor must cooperate with the trustee and be an “honest \ndebtor” in general; the failure to abide by these duties is grounds for a denial of discharge. \n \nThe individual debtor (not including partnerships or corporations) also must show evidence that he or she \nattended an approved nonprofit budget and counseling agency within 180 days before the filing. The \ncounseling may be “an individual or group briefing (including a briefing conducted by telephone or on the \nInternet) that outline[s] the opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted such individual in \nperforming a related budget analysis.” [1] In Section 111, the 2005 act describes who can perform this \ncounseling, and a host of regulations and enforcement mechanisms are instituted, generally applying to \npersons who provide goods or services related to bankruptcy work for consumer debtors whose \nnonexempt assets are less than $150,000, in order to improve the professionalism of attorneys and others \nwho work with debtors in, or contemplating, bankruptcy. A debtor who is incapacitated, disabled, or on \nactive duty in a military zone doesn’t have to go through the counseling. \n \nDebtor’s Exemptions \nThe bankruptcy act exempts certain property of the estate of an individual debtor so that he or she will not \nbe impoverished upon discharge. Exactly what is exempt depends on state law. \n \nNotwithstanding the Constitution’s mandate that Congress establish “uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies,” bankruptcy law is in fact not uniform because the states persuaded Congress to allow \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1135 \nnonuniform exemptions.

The concept makes sense: what is necessary for a debtor in Maine to live a \nnonimpoverished postbankruptcy life might not be the same as what is necessary in southern California. \nThe bankruptcy code describes how a person’s residence is determined for claiming state exemptions: \nbasically, where the debtor lived for 730 days immediately before filing or where she lived for 180 days \nimmediately preceding the 730-day period. For example, if the debtor resided in the same state, without \ninterruption, in the two years leading up to the bankruptcy, he can use that state’s exemptions. If not, the \nlocation where he resided for a majority of the half-year preceding the initial two years will be used. The \npoint here is to reduce “exemption shopping”—to reduce the incidences in which a person moves to a \ngenerous exemption state only to declare bankruptcy there. \n \nUnless the state has opted out of the federal exemptions (a majority have), a debtor can choose which \nexemptions to claim. [2] There are also some exemptions not included in the bankruptcy code: veteran’s, \nSocial Security, unemployment, and disability benefits are outside the code, and alimony payments are \nalso exempt under federal law. The federal exemptions can be doubled by a married couple filing together. \n \nHere are the federal exemptions: [3] \n \nHomestead: \n• \nReal property, including mobile homes and co-ops, or burial plots up to $20,200. Unused \nportion of homestead, up to $10,125, may be used for other property. \n \nPersonal Property: \n• \nMotor vehicle up to $3,225. \n• \nAnimals, crops, clothing, appliances and furnishings, books, household goods, and musical \ninstruments up to $525 per item, and up to $10,775 total. \n• \nJewelry up to $1,350. \n• \n$1,075 of any property, and unused portion of homestead up to $10,125. \n• \nHealth aids. \n• \nWrongful death recovery for person you depended upon. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1136 \n• \nPersonal injury recovery up to $20,200 except for pain and suffering or for pecuniary loss. \n• \nLost earnings payments. \n \nPensions: \n• \nTax exempt retirement accounts; IRAs and Roth IRAs up to $1,095,000 per person. \n \nPublic Benefits: \n• \nPublic assistance, Social Security, Veteran’s benefits, Unemployment Compensation. \n• \nCrime victim’s compensation. \n \nTools of Trade: \n• \nImplements, books, and tools of trade, up to $2,025. \n \nAlimony and Child Support: \n• \nAlimony and child support needed for support. \n \nInsurance: \n• \nUnmatured life insurance policy except credit insurance. \n• \nLife insurance policy with loan value up to $10,775. \n• \nDisability, unemployment, or illness benefits. \n• \nLife insurance payments for a person you depended on, which you need for support. \n \nIn the run-up to the 2005 changes in the bankruptcy law, there was concern that some states—especially \nFlorida [4]—had gone too far in giving debtors’ exemptions. The BAPCPA amended Section 522 to limit the \namount of equity a debtor can exempt, even in a state with unlimited homestead exemptions, in certain \ncircumstances. (Section 522(o) and (p) set out the law’s changes.) \n \nSecured Property \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1137 \nAs already noted, secured creditors generally have priority, even above the priority claims. That’s why \nbanks and lending institutions almost always secure the debtor’s obligations. But despite the general rule, \nthe debtor can avoid certain types of security interests. Liens that attach to assets that the debtor is \nentitled to claim as exempt can be avoided to the extent the lien impairs the value of the exemption in \nboth Chapter 13 and Chapter 7. To be avoidable, the lien must be a judicial lien (like a judgment or a \ngarnishment), or a nonpossessory, non-purchase-money security interest in household goods or tools of \nthe trade. \n \nTax liens (which are statutory liens, not judicial liens) aren’t avoidable in Chapter 7 even if they impair \nexemptions; tax liens can be avoided in Chapter 13 to the extent the lien is greater than the asset’s value. \n \nDischargeable and Nondischargeable Debts \nThe whole point of bankruptcy, of course, is for debtors to get relief from the press of debt that they \ncannot reasonably pay. \n \nDischargeable Debts \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable to pay any remaining unpaid debts (except \nnondischargeable debts) that arose before the court issued the order of relief. The discharge operates to \nvoid any money judgments already rendered against the debtor and to bar the judgment creditor from \nseeking to recover the judgment. \n \nNondischargeable Debts",

The discharge operates to \nvoid any money judgments already rendered against the debtor and to bar the judgment creditor from \nseeking to recover the judgment. \n \nNondischargeable Debts \nSome debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. A bankruptcy discharge varies, depending on the type of \nbankruptcy the debtor files (Chapter 7, 11, 12, or 13). The most common nondischargeable debts listed in \nSection 523 include the following: \n \n• \nAll debts not listed in the bankruptcy petition \n• \nStudent loans—unless it would be an undue hardship to repay them (seeSection 27.6 \"Cases\", In \nre Zygarewicz) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1138 \n• \nTaxes—federal, state, and municipal \n• \nFines for violating the law, including criminal fines and traffic tickets \n• \nAlimony and child support, divorce, and other property settlements \n• \nDebts for personal injury caused by driving, boating, or operating an aircraft while intoxicated \n• \nConsumer debts owed to a single creditor and aggregating more than $550 for luxury goods or \nservices incurred within ninety days before the order of relief \n• \nCash advances aggregating more than $825 obtained by an individual debtor within ninety days \nbefore the order for relief \n• \nDebts incurred because of fraud or securities law violations \n• \nDebts for willful injury to another’s person or his or her property \n• \nDebts from embezzlement \n \nThis is not an exhaustive list, and as noted in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 Liquidation\", there are some \ncircumstances in which it is not just certain debts that aren’t dischargeable: sometimes a discharge is \ndenied entirely. \n \nReaffirmation \nA debtor may reaffirm a debt that was discharged. Section 524 of the bankruptcy code provides important \nprotection to the debtor intent on doing so. No reaffirmation is binding unless the reaffirmation was \nmade prior to the granting of the discharge; the reaffirmation agreement must contain a clear and \nconspicuous statement that advises the debtor that the agreement is not required by bankruptcy or \nnonbankruptcy law and that the agreement may be rescinded by giving notice of rescission to the holder \nof such claim at any time prior to discharge or within sixty days after the agreement is filed with the court, \nwhichever is later. \n \nA written agreement to reaffirm a debt must be filed with the bankruptcy court. The attorney for the \ndebtor must file an affidavit certifying that the agreement represents a fully informed and voluntary \nagreement, that the agreement does not impose an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent of the \ndebtor, and that the attorney has fully advised the debtor of the legal consequences of the agreement and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1139 \nof a default under the agreement. Where the debtor is an individual who was not represented by an \nattorney during the course of negotiating the agreement, the reaffirmation agreement must be approved \nby the court, after disclosures to the debtor, and after the court finds that it is in the best interest of the \ndebtor and does not cause an undue hardship on the debtor or a dependent. \n \nProperty Included in the Estate \nWhen a bankruptcy petition is filed, a debtor’s estate is created consisting of all the debtor’s then-\nexisting property interests, whether legal or equitable. In addition, the estate includes any bequests, \ninheritances, and certain other distributions of property that the debtor receives within the next 180 days. \nIt also includes property recovered by the trustee under certain powers granted by the law. What is not \nexempt property will be distributed to the creditors. \n \nThe bankruptcy code confers on the trustee certain powers to recover property for the estate that the \ndebtor transferred before bankruptcy. \n \nOne such power (in Section 544) is to act as a hypothetical lien creditor. This power is best explained \nby an example. Suppose Dennis Debtor purchases equipment on credit from Acme Supply Company. \nAcme fails to perfect its security interest, and a few weeks later Debtor files a bankruptcy petition. By \nvirtue of the section conferring on the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor, the trustee can act \nas though she had a lien on the equipment, with priority over Acme’s unperfected security interest. Thus \nthe trustee can avoid Acme’s security interest, with the result that Acme would be treated as an unsecured \ncreditor. \n \nAnother power is to avoid transactions known as voidable preferences—transactions highly favorable",

Thus \nthe trustee can avoid Acme’s security interest, with the result that Acme would be treated as an unsecured \ncreditor. \n \nAnother power is to avoid transactions known as voidable preferences—transactions highly favorable \nto particular creditors. [5] A transfer of property is voidable if it was made (1) to a creditor or for his \nbenefit, (2) on account of a debt owed before the transfer was made, (3) while the debtor was insolvent, \n(4) on or within ninety days before the filing of the petition, and (5) to enable a creditor to receive more \nthan he would have under Chapter 7. If the creditor was an “insider”—one who had a special relationship \nwith the debtor, such as a relative or general partner of the debtor or a corporation that the debtor \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1140 \ncontrols or serves in as director or officer—then the trustee may void the transaction if it was made within \none year of the filing of the petition, assuming that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transaction \nwas made. \n \nSome prebankruptcy transfers that seem to fall within these provisions do not. The most important \nexceptions are (1) transfers made for new value (the debtor buys a refrigerator for cash one week before \nfiling a petition; this is an exchange for new value and the trustee may not void it); (2) a transfer that \ncreates a purchase-money security interest securing new value if the secured party perfects within ten \ndays after the debtor receives the goods; (3) payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of \nbusiness, on ordinary business terms; (4) transfers totaling less than $600 by an individual whose debts \nare primarily consumer debts; (5) transfers totaling less than $5,475 by a debtor whose debts are not \nprimarily consumer debts; and (6) transfers to the extent the transfer was a bona fide domestic support \nobligation. \n \nA third power of the trustee is to avoid fraudulent transfers made within two years before the date that \nthe bankruptcy petition was filed. [6] This provision contemplates various types of fraud. For example, \nwhile insolvent, the debtor might transfer property to a relative for less than it was worth, intending to \nrecover it after discharge. This situation should be distinguished from the voidable preference just \ndiscussed, in which the debtor pays a favored creditor what he actually owes but in so doing cannot then \npay other creditors. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA bankruptcy commences with the filing of a petition of bankruptcy. Creditors file proofs of claim and are \nentitled to certain priorities: domestic support obligations and the costs of administration are first. The debtor \nhas an obligation to file full and truthful schedules and to attend a credit counseling session, if applicable. The \ndebtor has a right to claim exemptions, federal or state, that leave her with assets sufficient to make a fresh \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1141 \nstart: some home equity, an automobile, and clothing and personal effects, among others. The honest debtor \nis discharged of many debts, but some are nondischargeable, among them taxes, debt from illegal behavior \n(embezzlement, drunk driving), fines, student loans, and certain consumer debt. A debtor may, after proper \ncounseling, reaffirm debt, but only before filing. The bankruptcy trustee takes over the nonexempt property \nof the debtor; he may act as a hypothetical lien creditor (avoiding unperfected security interests) and avoid \npreferential and fraudulent transfers that unfairly diminish the property of the estate. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The \nfollowing discussion is limited to certain provisions under Chapter 7. \n \n \nTrustee’s Duties \nIn addition to the duties already noted, the trustee has other duties under Chapter 7. He must sell the \nproperty for money, close up the estate “as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties \nin interest,” investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, examine proofs of claims, reject improper ones, \noppose the discharge of the debtor where doing so is advisable in the trustee’s opinion, furnish a creditor \nwith information about the estate and his administration (unless the court orders otherwise), file tax \nreports if the business continues to be operated, and make a final report and file it with the court. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1143 \n \nConversion \nUnder Section 706 of the bankruptcy code, the debtor may convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 11, 12, or \n13 at any time. The court may order a conversion to Chapter 11 at any time upon request of a party in \ninterest and after notice and hearing. And, as discussed next, a case may be converted from Chapter 7 to \nChapter 13 if the debtor agrees, or be dismissed if he does not, in those cases where the debtor makes too \nmuch money to be discharged without it being an “abuse” under the 2005 act. \n \nDismissal \nThe court may dismiss a case for three general reasons. \n \nThe first reason is “for cause,” after notice and a hearing for cause, including (1) unreasonable delay by the \ndebtor that prejudices creditors, (2) nonpayment of any fees required, (3) failure to file required \ndocuments and schedules. \n \nThe second reason for dismissal (or, with the debtor’s permission, conversion to Chapter 11 or 13) applies \nto debtors whose debt is primarily consumer debt: the court may—after notice and a hearing—dismiss a \ncase if granting relief would be “an abuse of the provisions” of the bankruptcy code. \nThe third reason for dismissal is really the crux of the 2005 law: under it, the court will find that granting \nrelief under Chapter 7 to a debtor whose debt is primarily consumer debt is “an abuse” if the debtor makes \ntoo much money. The debtor must pass a means test: If he’s poor enough, he can go Chapter 7. If he is not \npoor enough (or if they are not, in case of a married couple), Chapter 13—making payments to creditors—\nis the way to go. Here is one practitioner’s explanation of the means test: \nTo apply the means test, the courts will look at the debtor’s average income for the 6 months prior \nto filing [not the debtor’s income at the time of filing, when—say—she just lost her job] and \ncompare it to the median income for that state. For example, the median annual income for a \nsingle wage-earner in California is $42,012. If the income is below the median, then Chapter 7 \nremains open as an option. If the income exceeds the median, the remaining parts of the means \ntest will be applied. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1144",

Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 11 bankruptcies. \n2. Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 13 bankruptcies. \n \n \nReorganization: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy \nOverview \nChapter 11 provides a means by which corporations, partnerships, and other businesses, including sole \nproprietorships, can rehabilitate themselves and continue to operate free from the burden of debts that \nthey cannot pay. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1149 \n \nIt is simple enough to apply for the protection of the court in Chapter 11 proceeding, and for many years, \nlarge financially ailing companies have sought shelter in Chapter 11. Well-known examples include \nGeneral Motors, Texaco, K-Mart, Delta Airlines, and Northwest Airlines. An increasing number of \ncorporations have turned to Chapter 11 even though, by conventional terms, they were solvent. Doing so \nenables them to negotiate with creditors to reduce debt. It also may even permit courts to snuff out \nlawsuits that have not yet been filed. Chapters 3 and 5, discussed in Section 27.2 \"Case Administration; \nCreditors’ Claims; Debtors’ Exemptions and Dischargeable Debts; Debtor’s Estate\", apply to Chapter 11 \nproceedings also. Our discussion, therefore, is limited to special features of Chapter 11. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nAny person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 proceeding (plus railroads) is eligible for a Chapter 11 \nproceeding, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers. Individuals filing Chapter 11 must take credit \ncounseling; businesses do not. A company may voluntarily enter Chapter 11 or may be put there \ninvoluntarily by creditors. Individuals can file Chapter 11 particularly if they have too much debt to qualify \nfor Chapter 13 and make too much money to qualify for Chapter 7; under the 2005 act, individuals must \ncommit future wages to creditors, just as in Chapter 13. [1] \n \nOperation of Business \nUnless a trustee is appointed, the debtor will retain possession of the business and may continue to \noperate with its own management. The court may appoint a trustee on request of any party in interest \nafter notice and a hearing. The appointment may be made for cause—such as dishonesty, incompetence, \nor gross mismanagement—or if it is otherwise in the best interests of the creditors. Frequently, the same \nincompetent management that got the business into bankruptcy is left running it—that’s a criticism of \nChapter 11. \n \nCreditors’ Committee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1150 \nThe court must appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after issuing the order \nfor relief. The committee must consist of creditors willing to serve who have the seven largest claims, \nunless the court decides to continue a committee formed before the filing, if the committee was fairly \nchosen and adequately represents the various claims. The committee has several duties, including these: \n(1) to investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, (2) to determine whether to seek appointment of a trustee \nor to let the business continue to operate, and (3) to consult with the debtor or trustee throughout the \ncase. \n \nThe Reorganization Plan \nThe debtor may always file its own plan, whether in a voluntary or involuntary case. If the court leaves the \ndebtor in possession without appointing a trustee, the debtor has the exclusive right to file a \nreorganization plan during the first 120 days. If it does file, it will then have another 60 days to obtain the \ncreditors’ acceptances.

A class of claims accepts the plan if creditors representing at least two-thirds of the dollar \namount of claims and more than one-half the number of allowed claims vote in favor.

Once the court confirms the plan, \nthe plan is binding on all creditors. The rules governing confirmation are complex, but in essence, they \ninclude the following requirements: \n1. The plan must have been proposed in good faith. Companies must also make a good-faith attempt to \nnegotiate modifications in their collective bargaining agreements (labor union contracts). \n2. All provisions of the act must have been complied with. \n3. The court must have determined that the reorganized business will be likely to succeed and be \nunlikely to require further financial reorganization in the foreseeable future. \n4. Impaired classes of claims and interests must have accepted the plan, unless the plan treats them in a \n“fair and equitable” manner, in which case consent is not required. This is sometimes referred to as \nthe cram-down provision. \n5. All members of every class must have received no less value than they would have in Chapter 7 \nliquidation. \n \nDischarge, Conversion \nThe debtor gets discharged when all payments under the plan are completed.

Under \nthis chapter, the individual debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court appoints a trustee. \nIf the creditors wind up with more under the plan presented than they would receive in Chapter 7 \nproceeding, then the court is likely to approve it. In general, a Chapter 13 repayment plan extends the \ntime to pay the debt and may reduce it so that the debtor need not pay it all. Typically, the debtor will pay \na fixed sum monthly to the trustee, who will distribute it to the creditors. The previously discussed \nprovisions of Chapters 3 and 5 apply also to this chapter; therefore, the discussion that follows focuses on \nsome unique features of Chapter 13. \nPeople seek Chapter 13 discharges instead of Chapter 7 for various reasons: they make too much money to \npass the Chapter 7 means test; they are behind on their mortgage or car payments and want to make them \nup over time and reinstate the original agreement; they have debts that can’t be discharged in Chapter 7; \nthey have nonexempt property they want to keep; they have codebtors on a personal debt who would be \nliable if the debtor went Chapter 7; they have a real desire to pay their debts but cannot do so without \ngetting the creditors to give them some breathing room. Chapter 7 cases may always be converted to \nChapter 13. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nChapter 13 is voluntary only. Anyone—sole proprietorships included—who has a regular income, \nunsecured debts of less than $336,000, and secured debts of less than $1,010,650 is eligible to seek its \nprotection. The debts must be unpaid and owing at the time the debtor applies for relief. If the person has",

Understand that there are nonbankruptcy alternatives for debtors who cannot pay their bills in a timely \nway: assignment for benefit of creditors, compositions, and receiverships. \n2. Recognize the reasons why these alternatives might not work. \n \n \nAlternatives to Bankruptcy: Overview \nBankruptcy is a necessary thing in a capitalist economic system. As already noted, without it, few people \nwould be willing to take business risks, and the economy would necessarily operate at a lower level \n(something some people might not think so bad overall). But bankruptcy, however “enlightened” society \nmay have become about it since Victorian days, still carries a stigma. Bankruptcy filings are public \ninformation; the lists of people and businesses who declare bankruptcy are regularly published in monthly \nbusiness journals. Bankruptcy is expensive, too, and both debtors and creditors become enmeshed in \nsignificantly complex federal law. For these reasons, among others, both parties frequently determine it is \nin their best interest to find an alternative to bankruptcy. Here we take up briefly three common \nalternatives. \n \nIn other parts of this book, other nonbankruptcy creditors’ rights are discussed: under the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC), creditors have rights to reclaim goods sold and delivered but not paid for; under \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1156 \nthe UCC, too, creditors have a right to repossess personal property that has been put up as collateral for \nthe debtor’s loan or extension of credit; and mortgagees have the right to repossess real estate without \njudicial assistance in many circumstances. These nonbankruptcy remedies are governed mostly by state \nlaw. \n \nThe nonbankruptcy alternatives discussed here are governed by state law also. \n \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors; Compositions; Receivership \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors \nUnder a common-law assignment for the benefit of creditors, the debtor transfers some or all of his \nassets to a trustee—usually someone appointed by the adjustment bureau of a local credit managers’ \nassociation—who sells the assets and apportions the proceeds in some agreed manner, usually pro rata, to \nthe creditors. Of course, not every creditor need agree with such a distribution. Strictly speaking, the \ncommon-law assignment does not discharge the balance of the debt. Many state statutes attempt to \naddress this problem either by prohibiting creditors who accept a partial payment of debt under an \nassignment from claiming the balance or by permitting debtors to demand a release from creditors who \naccept partial payment. \n \nComposition \nA composition is simply an agreement by creditors to accept less than the full amount of the debt and to \ndischarge the debtor from further liability. As a contract, composition requires consideration; the mutual \nagreement among creditors to accept a pro rata share of the proceeds is held to be sufficient consideration \nto support the discharge. The essential difference between assignment and composition lies in the \ncreditors’ agreement: an assignment implies no agreement among the creditors, whereas a composition \ndoes. Not all creditors of the particular debtor need agree to the composition for it to be valid. A creditor \nwho does not agree to the composition remains free to attempt to collect the full sum owed; in particular, \na creditor not inclined to compose the debt could attach the debtor’s assets while other creditors are \nbargaining over the details of the composition agreement. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1157 \nOne advantage of the assignment over the composition is that in the former the debtor’s assets—having",

See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of \naffairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.”… \n• \nThe third prong requires “that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.…” \n \n(Pena, citing Brunner v. N.Y. State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., [Citation]). \n \nDebtor must satisfy all three parts of the Brunner test before her student loans can be discharged. Failure \nto prove any of the three prongs will defeat a debtor’s case. \n \nWhen this bankruptcy case was filed in September 2005, the debtor was a single woman and had no \ndependents. She is 39 years old. \n \nSchedule I reported that the debtor was unemployed. The debtor’s responses to the Statement of Financial \nAffairs revealed that she had received $5,500 in income during 2005 prior to the filing of the petition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1160 \nEvidence at trial indicated that after the petition was filed, the debtor found work and earned a total of \n$9,424 in 2005. In 2004 and 2003, she earned $13,994 and $17,339, respectively. \nDespite this modest income, the debtor did not immediately file an adversary proceeding to determine the \ndischargeability of her student loans. It was almost three years after the entry of her chapter 7 discharge \n‘on January 3, 2006 that the debtor reopened her chapter 7 case in order to pursue this adversary \nproceeding.’ \n \nIn her complaint, the debtor admits that after she received a discharge, she found part-time work with a \nchurch and later took a full-time job as a speech therapist. During 2006, the debtor earned $20,009 and \nin 2007 she earned $37,314. Hence, while it is clear the debtor’s income was very modest in the time \nperiod immediately prior to her bankruptcy petition, her financial situation improved during her \nbankruptcy case. \n \nThe court cannot conclude based on the evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances up to the date of \nthe discharge, that she was unable to maintain a minimal standard of living if she was required to repay \nher students [sic] loans. \n \nHowever, in January 2007, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident. Her injuries eventually \nhalted the financial progress she had been making and eventually prevented her from working. She now \nsubsists on social security disability payments. \n \nThe circumstance creating the debtor’s hardship, the automobile accident, occurred after her chapter 7 \npetition was filed, indeed, approximately one year after her discharge was entered. The debtor is \nmaintaining that this post-petition, post-discharge circumstance warrants a declaration that her student \nloans were discharged effective from the petition date. \n \nWhen must the circumstances creating a debtor’s hardship arise: before the bankruptcy case is filed; after \nthe case if filed but prior to the entry of a discharge; or at anytime, including after the entry of a \ndischarge? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1161 \n \nThe court concludes that the circumstances causing a chapter 7 debtor’s financial hardship must arise \nprior to the entry of the discharge. If the circumstances causing a debtor’s hardship arise after the entry of \na discharge, those circumstances cannot form the basis of a determination that repayment of a student \nloan will be an undue hardship.… \n \n[T]here is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code requiring that a complaint under section 523(a)(8) [to \ndischarge student loans] be filed at any particular point in a bankruptcy case, whether it is filed under \nchapter 7 or 13. [Relevant Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure] permits such dischargeability \ncomplaints to be brought at any time, including after the entry of a discharge and the closing of the \nbankruptcy case.… \n \nWhile a debtor’s decision to file an action to determine the dischargeability of a student loan is not \ntemporally constrained, this does not mean that a debtor’s financial hardship may arise after a discharge \nhas been entered. \n \n[The] Coleman [case, cited by debtor] deals with the ripeness of a dispute concerning the dischargeability \nof a student loan. [The Ninth Circuit held that it] is ripe for adjudication at any point during the case.

N.Y. 1984) \n \nLifland, Bankruptcy Judge. \n \nWhether an industrial enterprise in the United States is highly successful is often gauged by its \n“membership” in what has come to be known as the “Fortune 500”. Having attained this measure of \nfinancial achievement, Johns-Manville Corp. and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as \n“Manville”) were deemed a paradigm of success in corporate America by the financial community. Thus, \nManville’s filing for protection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (“the Code or the \nBankruptcy Code”) on August 26, 1982 (“the filing date”) was greeted with great surprise and \nconsternation on the part of some of its creditors and other corporations that were being sued along with \nManville for injuries caused by asbestos exposure. As discussed at length herein, Manville submits that \nthe sole factor necessitating its filing is the mammoth problem of uncontrolled proliferation of asbestos \nhealth suits brought against it because of its substantial use for many years of products containing \nasbestos which injured those who came into contact with the dust of this lethal substance. According to \nManville, this current problem of approximately 16,000 lawsuits pending as of the filing date is \ncompounded by the crushing economic burden to be suffered by Manville over the next 20–30 years by \nthe filing of an even more staggering number of suits by those who had been exposed but who will not \nmanifest the asbestos-related diseases until some time during this future period (“the future asbestos \nclaimants”). Indeed, approximately 6,000 asbestos health claims are estimated to have arisen in only the \nfirst 16 months since the filing date. This burden is further compounded by the insurance industry’s \ngeneral disavowal of liability to Manville on policies written for this very purpose. \n \nIt is the propriety of the filing by Manville which is the subject of the instant decision. Four separate \nmotions to dismiss the petition pursuant to Section 1112(b) of the Code have been lodged before this \nCourt.… \nPreliminarily, it must be stated that there is no question that Manville is eligible to be a debtor under the \nCode’s statutory requirements. Moreover, it should also be noted that neither Section 109 nor any other \nprovision relating to voluntary petitions by companies contains any insolvency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1165 \nrequirement.…Accordingly, it is abundantly clear that Manville has met all of the threshold eligibility \nrequirements for filing a voluntary petition under the Code.… \n \nA “principal goal” of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide “open access” to the “bankruptcy process.” \n[Citation.] The rationale behind this “open access” policy is to provide access to bankruptcy relief which is \nas “open” as “access to the credit economy.” Thus, Congress intended that “there should be no legal \nbarrier to voluntary petitions.” Another major goal of the Code, that of “rehabilitation of debtors,” \nrequires that relief for debtors must be “timely.” Congress declared that it is essential to both the “open \naccess” and “rehabilitation” goals that \n \n[i]nitiating relief should not be a death knell. The process should encourage resort to it, by \ndebtors and creditors, that cuts short the dissipation of assets and the accumulation of debts. \nBelated commencement of a case may kill an opportunity for reorganization or arrangement. \n \nAccordingly, the drafters of the Code envisioned that a financially beleaguered debtor with real debt and \nreal creditors should not be required to wait until the economic situation is beyond repair in order to file a \nreorganization petition. The “Congressional purpose” in enacting the Code was to encourage resort to the \nbankruptcy process. This philosophy not only comports with the elimination of an insolvency \nrequirement, but also is a corollary of the key aim of Chapter 11 of the Code, that of avoidance of \nliquidation. The drafters of the Code announced this goal, declaring that reorganization is more efficient",

This is because a bankruptcy discharge is a legal order that releases the debtor from personal liability for certain debts. If the court were to allow postdischarge relief, it would mean that the debtor could continue to discharge their student loans based on events that occurred after the bankruptcy discharge was granted. This could potentially lead to a situation where the debtor could continue to discharge their student loans indefinitely, which would be unfair to the creditors who are owed the money.

Ryan was sentenced to fifty-seven months in \nprison followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, Ryan was ordered to pay a fine of \n$7,500…, costs of prosecution in the amount of $83,420, and a special assessment of $50.00. Ryan served \nhis sentence. He also paid the $7,500 fine. The district court, following an appellate mandate, ultimately \neliminated the restitution obligation. \n \nOn April 25, 2003, Ryan filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 7 in the District of Idaho. He \nreceived his chapter 7 discharge on August 11, 2003. Shortly thereafter, Ryan filed a case under chapter \n13, listing as his only obligation the amount of unpaid costs of prosecution owed to the United States \n(“Government”).… \n \nRyan completed payments under the plan, and an “Order of Discharge” was entered on October 5, 2006. \nThe chapter 13 trustee’s final report reflected that the Government received $2,774.89 from payments \nmade by Ryan under his plan, but a balance of $77,088.34 on the Government’s costs of prosecution \nclaim remained unpaid. Ryan then renewed his request for determination of dischargeability. The \nbankruptcy court held that the unpaid portion of the Government’s claim for costs of prosecution was \nexcepted from discharge by § 1328(a)(3). Ryan appealed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1168 \n \nSection 1328(a)(3) provides an exception to discharge in chapter 13 for “restitution, or a criminal fine.” It \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \n[A]s soon as practicable after the completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, the \ncourt shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under \nsection 502 of this title except any debt… \n \n(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime \n[.] [emphasis added]. \n \nThe essential question, then, is whether these costs of prosecution constitute a “criminal fine.” \n \nStatutory interpretation begins with a review of the particular language used by Congress in the relevant \nversion of the law. [Citation.] \n \nThe term “criminal fine” is not defined in [Chapter 13] or anywhere else in the Bankruptcy Code. \nHowever, its use in § 1328(a)(3) implicates two important policies embedded in the Bankruptcy Code. \nFirst, in light of the objective to provide a fresh start for debtors overburdened by debts that they cannot \npay, exceptions to discharge are interpreted strictly against objecting creditors and in favor of \ndebtors. See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation. \n \n“[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy \njudgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over \nthree years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, \nperhaps for the rest of their lives.” [Citations.] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1169 \n \nA second, countervailing policy consideration is a historic deference, both in the Bankruptcy Code and in \nthe administration of prior bankruptcy law, to excepting criminal sanctions from discharge in bankruptcy. \nApplication of this policy is consistent with a general recognition that, “[t]he principal purpose of the \nBankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’” [Citation] (emphasis \nadded [in original]). \n \nThe legislative history is clear that [in its 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law] Congress intended to \noverrule the result in [of a 1990 Supreme Court case so that]:…“[N]o debtor with criminal restitution \nobligations will be able to discharge them through any bankruptcy proceeding.”… \n \nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant \nto pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a \nspecial fund for victims’ compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury.… \n \nTo honor the principle that exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly in favor of debtors, \nparticularly in chapter 13, where a broad discharge was provided by Congress as an incentive for debtors \nto opt for relief under that chapter rather than under chapter 7, it is not appropriate to expand the scope \nof the [Chapter 13] exception beyond the terms of the statute. Congress could have adopted an exception",

                    "answer": "The term 'criminal fine' in the context of the Bankruptcy Code refers to a monetary penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. It is a form of punishment for the offense and is intended to deter future criminal behavior. The amount of the fine is typically determined by the court based on the severity of the offense and the financial resources of the offender. Criminal fines are distinct from civil fines, which are imposed for violations of civil law and are generally lower in amount."

The current law is the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which provides for six types of proceedings: (1) \nliquidation, Chapter 7; (2) adjustment of debts of a municipality, Chapter 9; (3) reorganization, Chapter \n11; (4) family farmers with regular income, Chapter 12; (5) individuals with regular income, Chapter 13; \nand (6) cross-border bankruptcies, Chapter 15. \n \nWith some exceptions, any individual, partnership, or corporation seeking liquidation may file a voluntary \npetition in bankruptcy. An involuntary petition is also possible; creditors petitioning for that must meet \ncertain criteria. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1171 \nA petition operates as a stay against the debtor for lawsuits to recover claims or enforce judgments or \nliens. A judge will issue an order of relief and appoint a trustee, who takes over the debtor’s property and \npreserves security interests. To recover monies owed, creditors must file proof of claims. The trustee has \ncertain powers to recover property for the estate that the debtor transferred before bankruptcy. These \ninclude the power to act as a hypothetical lien creditor, to avoid fraudulent transfers and voidable \npreferences. \n \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priority among them. After secured \nparties take their security, the priorities are (1) domestic support obligations, (2) administrative expenses, \n(3) gap creditor claims, (4) employees’ wages, salaries, commissions, (5) contributions to employee \nbenefit plans, (6) grain or fish producers’ claims against a storage facility, (7) consumer deposits, (8) taxes \nowed to governments, (9) allowed claims for personal injury or death resulting from debtor’s driving or \noperating a vessel while intoxicated. After these priority claims are paid, the trustee must distribute the \nestate in this order: (a) unsecured creditors who filed timely, (b) unsecured creditors who filed late, (c) \npersons claiming fines and the like, (d) all other creditors, (e) the debtor. Most bankruptcies are no-asset, \nso creditors get nothing. \n \nUnder Chapter 7’s 2005 amendments, debtors must pass a means test to be eligible for relief; if they make \ntoo much money, they must file Chapter 13. \n \nCertain property is exempt from the estate of an individual debtor. States may opt out of the federal list of \nexemptions and substitute their own; most have. \n \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable for most debts. However, some debts are not",

Chapter 13 allows individuals to keep their property and repay their debts over a period of time, while Chapter 7 requires individuals to liquidate their assets to pay off their creditors. Chapter 13 also allows individuals to modify their debt payments and extend the repayment period, which can make it easier for individuals to repay their debts. Additionally, Chapter 13 provides a discharge for certain types of debts, such as certain taxes and student loans, that are not dischargeable under Chapter 7."

Under Chapter 11, the debtor retains possession \nof the business and may continue to operate it with its own management unless the court appoints a \ntrustee. The court may do so either for cause or if it is in the best interests of the creditors. The court must \nappoint a committee of unsecured creditors, who remain active throughout the proceeding. The debtor \nmay file its own reorganization plan and has the exclusive right to do so within 120 days if it remains in \npossession.

It is binding on all creditors, and the debtor is discharged from all debts once the court confirms \nthe plan. \n \nChapter 13 is for any individual with regular income who has difficulty paying debts; it is voluntary only; \nthe debtor must get credit counseling. The debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court \nappoints a trustee. The plan extends the time to pay and may reduce the size of the debt.

Some debts not dischargeable under Chapter 7 \nmay be under Chapter 13. \n \nAlternatives to bankruptcy are (1) composition (agreement by creditors to accept less than the face \namount of the debt), (2) assignment for benefit of creditors (transfer of debtor’s property to a trustee, who \nuses it to pay debts), and (3) receivership (a disinterested person is appointed by the court to preserve \nassets and distribute them at the court’s direction).

In these programs, the players and their decisions\ncan lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy\nof the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.",

In these programs, the players and their decisions can lead to tremendous wealth or tremendous losses. In reality, most of us will manage our portfolios well shy of the extremes portrayed by the entertainment industry. However, we will need to make personal and business investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry as personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers. Financial Markets and Institutions Financial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system. There is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking and need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in our economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual investment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund. Much of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a response to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the desire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our primary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was formed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank regulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-backed bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank. These regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and investment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial advice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal lending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits. Today, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or worked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank operations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking has narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial system, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and prosper."

                    "question": "What is the difference between capital structure and capital budgeting?",
                    "answer": "Capital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and increasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with economists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial information and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included each of these three aspects of business finance into the plan. Figure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet Figure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are related to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital budgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt and equity financing. Investments Investments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics include the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles, regulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative securities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement accounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common discussion topics and investment opportunities.

Accessed April 18, 2021.\nWhy We Study Finance\nFinance is the lubricant that keeps our economy running smoothly. Issuing a mortgage can be profitable for a\nbank, but it also allows people to live in their own homes and to pay for them over time. Do MasterCard,\nVenmo, and PayPal make money when you use their product? Sure, but think how much more convenient and\nsafer it is to carry a card or use an app instead of cash. In addition, these services allow you to easily track\nwhere and how you spend your money. A well-regulated and independent financial system is important to\ncapital-based economies. Our smoothly functioning financial system has removed us from the days of strictly\nbartering to our system today, where transactions are as simple as a tap on your mobile phone.\nThere are any number of professional and personal reasons to study finance. A search of the internet provides\na long list of finance-related professions. Interviews with senior managers reveal that an understanding of\nfinancial tools and concepts is an important consideration in hiring new employees. Financial skills are among\n2\nBrookings Institution. “Ben S.

Government and\nwork-guaranteed pension benefits are growing less common and less generous, meaning individuals must\ntake greater responsibility for their personal financial well-being now and at retirement. Let’s take a closer\nlook at some of the reasons why we study finance.\nThere are many career opportunities in the fields of finance. A single course in finance such as this one may\npique your interest and encourage you to study more finance-related topics. These studies in turn may qualify\nyou for engaging and high-paying finance careers. We take a closer look at financial career opportunities in\nCareers in Finance.\nA career in finance is just one reason to study finance. Finance is an excellent decision-making tool; it requires\nanalytical thinking. Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live. Read “5 Reasons Why You Should Study Finance” at Harvard Business School Online\n(https://openstax.org/r/why-study-finance) to gain a better understanding of why finance offers a broad\ncareer path and is intellectually stimulating and satisfying.\nRisk and Return in Finance\nFinance tells us that an increase in risk results in an increase in expected return. The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.",

Job descriptions vary\nacross firms, industries, and government organizations. However, the role of financial analyst usually includes\nmarket research, financial forecasting, modeling, cost analysis, and comparative valuations. Financial analysts\ngather data and produce financial reports in conjunction with multiple departments within a business or\norganization. They rely on marketing and production personnel to provide accurate sales forecasts, and they\nwork with accountants to create accurate financial reports.\nAs a financial analyst, you need strong spreadsheet skills, the ability to develop financial models and pro forma\nfinancial statements, outstanding analytical skills, and an overall understanding of business processes.\nFinancial analysts possess a well-diversified collection of business and communication skills, both quantitative\nand qualitative. Figure 1.6 lists some tasks that financial analysts must perform on a daily basis. Some firms\nrequire an MBA or several years of business experience for their financial analysts.\n1.4 • Careers in Finance\n19\nFigure 1.6 Financial Analyst Tasks\nInternal financial analysts are important for a successful firm or organization because their work can lead to\nmore efficient and cost-effective use of financial and nonfinancial resources. Responsibilities include keeping\ncurrent with market conditions, developing financial models, reconciling variance between forecasts and\noutcomes, and serving as a resource for management. Financial analysts fulfill their responsibilities through\nthe development and analysis of financial data including ratio analysis, trend analysis, in-depth discussions\nwith division managers, and the presentation and interpretation of information at meetings and on electronic\nplatforms.\nExternal financial analysts use similar resources and tools to evaluate financial instruments as an aid to\ninvestment companies, investment and commercial bankers, and individual investors who rely on their\npublished reports. Various government agencies also use financial analysts to aid in regulatory oversight and\nenforcement.\nA report from a 2019 BLS survey determines that financial analysts earn an average salary of $81,590, and jobs\nare predicted to grow at a faster-than-average rate of 5% through 2029.5\nBusiness (or Management) Analyst Roles\nThe job description for a business analyst looks much like that for a financial analyst.

However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

For example, if you purchase 13-week T-bills issued in the first week of January, each\nbill is identical to any other in the issue. Compare that to the purchase of physical assets such as a car or\nhouse, where each of the assets sold has some unique feature or measure of quality.\nFinancial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs\nissue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess\nof $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit.

They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds\ninterest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds\nmarket by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market. Many of the borrowing and lending\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\nCapital Markets and Instruments\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the\nmoney market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high, and\nliquidity is less certain, as is the homogeneity of the financial instruments. Broadly, we separate capital market\ninstruments into debt instruments traded in the bond markets and equity securities traded on the stock\nmarkets.\nThe federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay\npast borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\nTreasury notes.\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\nrating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from",

As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management.

Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation.

S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAmazon\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n43\nAmazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at the Amazon\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\nIncorporating a Business\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•\nList and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\n•\nExplain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\nStakeholders\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.",

Every public company is legally required to install a\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.",

The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\nand regulations.\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\nfollowing:\n•\nThat the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\nfinancial reporting\n•\nThat the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\nreporting of financial results\n•\nThat the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\nthe most recent fiscal year\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\nauditors.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\nsaves money.\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\nacting in their best interest.

Madoff’s fraud\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\nhad been newly invested.\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\n(Sources: Diana B.

When perpetuated, these differences may\neventually result in lasting conflicts of interest. In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences.

Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any",

This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n0\n25\n10\n20\n20\n15\n30\n10\n40\n5\n50\nTable 3.1 Demand\nSchedule for Pizza\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\n68\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 3.2 Demand Curve for Pizzas\nThe inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.\nFirst, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you\ndiminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher. The\ndemand schedule for pizzas might look like Table 3.2 after an increase in the price of hamburgers.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n9\n25\n19\n20\n29\n15\n39\n10\n49\n5\n59\nTable 3.2 Demand\nSchedule for Pizzas\nafter the Price of\nHamburgers Doubles\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n69\nThis change leads to a movement in the demand curve—outward to the right, as shown in Figure 3.3. This is\nknown as an increase in demand. Now, at a price of $25, people will purchase 19 pizzas instead of 10; and at a\nprice of $15, people will purchase 39 pizzas instead of 30.\nFigure 3.3 An Increase in Demand Represented as a Movement of the Demand Curve to the Right\nA decrease in demand would cause the demand curve to move to the left. This could happen if people’s tastes\nand preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food\nchoice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDemand Curve Shifts\nIf any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the\ndemand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus. Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale. Thus, there is a positive relationship\nbetween the price and quantity supplied.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n60\n25\n50\n20\n40\n15\n30\n10\n20\n5\n10\nTable 3.3 Supply\nSchedule for Pizzas\n70\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates",

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls. Whenever there is inflation, a $100 bill will not\npurchase as much as it did before.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCPI Inflation Calculator\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, $100 in January 1913 had the same purchasing power as\n$1,722.45 in January 2000 and $2,699.20 in January 2021. If you would like to compare the purchasing power\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\nago.\nHow Is Inflation Measured\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Billion Prices Project",

Significant increases in the CPI within a\nshort time frame might indicate a period of inflation, and significant decreases in CPI within a short time frame\nmight indicate a period of deflation. However, because the CPI includes volatile food and oil prices, it might\nnot be a reliable measure of inflationary and deflationary periods. For more accurate detection, the core CPI,\nor CPILFESL (https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed-org)—the CPIAUCSL minus food and energy—is often\nused. When using the CPI, please note that it is not applicable to all consumers and should not be used to\ndetermine relative living costs. Additionally, the CPI is a statistical measure vulnerable to sampling error\nbecause it is based on a sample of prices and not the complete average.\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is a measure of people who are not working. For the individuals who find themselves without\na job, unemployment causes financial hardship. From a macroeconomics standpoint, unemployment means\nthat society has labor resources that are not being fully utilized.\nNot everyone who is without a job is unemployed. To be considered unemployed, a person must be (1)\njobless, (2) actively seeking work, and (3) able to take a job. The official unemployment rate is the percentage\nof the labor force that is unemployed. It is calculated as\nNote that the unemployment rate is calculated as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed, rather\nthan the percent of the total population. Only those who are currently employed or who meet the definition of\nbeing unemployed are counted in the labor force. In other words, someone who is retired or a stay-at-home\nparent and is not seeking employment is not counted as unemployed and is not part of the labor force.\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the US Department of Labor reports the unemployment rate each\nmonth. These figures are attained through an interview process of 60,000 households conducted by the\nCensus Bureau. (See Figure 3.11 for a graphic representation of historical trends in unemployment from 1950\nto early 2021.)\n2\nData from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in US City Average\n(CPIAUCSL).” FRED.

To compare the rates in various countries, visit the unemployment\nstatistics section (https://openstax.org/r/data-world-bank) of the World Bank website.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the size of an economy. A country’s GDP is the dollar value of\nall of the final goods and service produced within that country during a year. GDP measures the value of all of\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\nHow Is GDP Measured?\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption spending measures the items that households purchase, such as movie theater tickets,\ncups of coffee, and clothing. Consumption expenditure accounts for about two-thirds of the US GDP.4\nInvestment spending refers primarily to purchases by businesses. It is important to note that in this context,\nthe term investment does not refer to purchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial securities. Instead, the\nterm refers to purchasing new capital goods, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment, that will be used\nto produce other goods. Residential housing is also included in the investment-spending category, as are\ninventories.

A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.",

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\nof\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\nexchange rate.\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCurrency Conversion\nDo you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much\nthat 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\nCurrency Appreciation\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange",

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle\na period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\nceteris paribus\nholding all other things constant\nconsumer price index (CPI)\na measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\ncore inflation index\na measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\ndemand\nthe quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\ntime period, ceteris paribus\neconomic exposure\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\ncustomers\nequilibrium\nthe point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\nequilibrium price\nthe price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\nexpansion\nthe part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\n3 • Summary\n95\nGDP deflator\na measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, intended to measure what\nGDP would be if prices did not change from one year to the next",

Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.",

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).",

This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples\nwe have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\nand n as the number\nof periods (12 months in a year;\n) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\ntimes a year, would grow to\nin one year. Note that this final amount ends up\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\n218\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.\nThe total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples\nare insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher\ninterest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\nbecome far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\nTen million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\nproduce\n. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be\nvery pleased to earn that additional $55,088.10 by simply having their funds in an account that features\nquarterly compounding.\nIn another example, $200 at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes\n, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to\n.\nAn amount of $1 at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth\n. The same\ndollar at the same interest rate, compounded monthly over the course of a century, will grow to\n.\nThis would all seem to make sense due to the fact that in situations when compounding increases in\nfrequency, interest income is being received during the year as opposed to at the end of the year and thus\ngrows more rapidly to become a larger and more valuable sum of money. This is important because we know\nthrough the concept of TVM that having money now is more useful to us than having that same amount of\nmoney at some later point in time.\nThe Rule of 72\nThe rule of 72 is a simple and often very useful mathematical shortcut that can help you estimate the impact of\nany interest or growth rate and can be used in situations ranging from financial calculations to projections of\npopulation growth. The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very",

Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\n228\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninvestment valuations: the value of an investment generally represents our expectations of all future cash\nflows from that investment, discounted to today’s dollars.\nBecause a perpetuity is a stream of payments continuing indefinitely, determining the future value isn’t\npossible. Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.",

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.",

The final column gives the bond rating, a grade that indicates credit quality. As we\nprogress through this chapter, we will examine prices, coupon rates, yields, and bond ratings in more\ndetail\nTypes of Bonds\nThere are three primary categories of bonds, though the specifics of these different types of bond can vary\ndepending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest rate, and risk.\nGovernment Bonds\nThe safest category of bonds are short-term US Treasury bills (T-bills). These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

                    "answer": "A bond is a debt instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower. The borrower agrees to pay interest on the loan and to repay the principal at a later date. A stock, on the other hand, represents an ownership stake in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder in the company and are entitled to a portion of the company's profits. The main difference between a bond and a stock is that a bond is a loan, while a stock is an ownership stake. Bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks, as the borrower is obligated to repay the loan, while the value of a stock can fluctuate based on the performance of the company."

                    "answer": "A bond and a note are both debt instruments that represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower. The main difference between a bond and a note is the length of time the loan is for. A bond is typically a long-term loan, with a maturity date of at least one year. A note, on the other hand, is a short-term loan, with a maturity date of less than one year. Another difference between a bond and a note is the interest rate. Bonds typically have a fixed interest rate, while notes can have a variable interest rate. Finally, bonds are typically issued by governments or large corporations, while notes are often issued by small businesses or individuals."

            "chunk": "As we touched on earlier, bonds are fixed-income investments, and because of this, they are subject to a\nnumber of risks that could have negative effects on their market value. The most common and best-known\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\nrisks are the following:\n•\nCredit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk. Call risk is the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing\nfirm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has\na call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by\nissuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has\nthe effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.",

We want to find the average growth rate given an initial dividend (present value) of $0.70, the most\nrecent dividend (future value) of $2.11, and the number of years (n) between the two dividends, or the number\nof dividend changes, which is 9.

The first method, calculating the\nchange in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach. The second\nmethod, using the first and last dividends only, is the geometric approach. The arithmetic approach is\nequivalent to a simple interest approach, and the geometric approach is equivalent to a compound interest\napproach.\nTo apply our PV formula above, we had to assume that the company would pay dividends forever and that we\nwould hold on to our stock forever. If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer\nis a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend\nstream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling\nprice at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing\ndividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:\nwhere n is the number of future dividends.\nThis equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates\nthe percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of the nth year.\nSay you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years.

Begin with the following:\n338\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNow, multiply the result by the price for your portion of the infinite stream:\nThe next step is to discount the selling price of Johnson & Johnson in 10 years at 17% and then add the two\nvalues to get the stock’s price. So, how do we estimate the stock’s price at the end of 10 years? If we elect to\nsell the stock after 10 years and the company will continue to pay dividends at the same growth rate, what\nwould a buyer be willing to pay? How could we estimate the selling price (value) of the stock at that time?\nWe need to estimate the dividend in 10 years and assume a growth rate and the required return of the new\nowner at that point in time. Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend\ngrowth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus\none raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:\nWe then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:\nYour price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell\nfor $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:\nWhy did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite\nmodel? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%.

The federal funds market traditionally\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a\nfraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately\nneed cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called\n“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate\nrange in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The\nfederal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for\nseveral reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\nreserves.\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets\n355\nDaily trading volume in the federal funds market from 2016 through 2020 ranged from a high of $115 billion in\nMarch of 2018 to a low of only $34 billion on December 31, 2020.2 The volume of federal funds activity is lower\nin periods of slower economic growth because banks have fewer good opportunities to issue loans and are\nless likely to be short of required reserves.\nBond Markets\nBond markets are financial markets that make payments to investors for a specific period of time. Investors\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\nGovernment Bond Markets\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The\nTreasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov\n(https://openstax.org/r/treasurydirect.gov) in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in\nthat they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of\nthe note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\nexempt from state and local taxes.\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\nfinancial crisis.\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and",

                    "question": "What is the market for federal funds?",
                    "answer": "The market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate on federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools. The federal funds market traditionally consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial institutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a fraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately need cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called “discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the maturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market negotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate range in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market."

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks.

It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\n14\nJeremy J. Siegel.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented\nhere, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of\ninflation.\nYear\n1980 2000 2020 Annual Change\nCollege tuition and fees\n70.8 331.9 877.3\n6.49%\nRent\n80.9 183.9 341.5\n3.67%\nUsed cars and trucks\n62.3 155.8 144.2\n2.12%\nGround beef\n104.6 125.2 296.2\n2.64%\nButter\n89.4 135.9 248.7\n2.59%\nCPI (1982 to 1984 = 100)\n82.4 172.2 258.8\n2.90%\nTable 12.3 Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods (source:\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)\nUsing Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior\nThe CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States. Figure 12.5\nshows the eight major categories of expenditures included in the CPI.16 Different regions of the country and\npopulation subgroups may experience different rates of inflation. Retired people may spend a greater portion\nof their income on healthcare than someone in their twenties.17 Residents on the East and West Coasts spend\na higher percentage of their earnings on housing than those living in the Midwest.18 As such, there are several\ndifferent measures of inflation based on geographic region or other factors.19 It is worth noting that a basket\nof goods and services that cost $100 in 1984 would cost approximately $260 by the end of 2020, an increase of\n160% (see Figure 12.6)! Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI\nwas 2.55%. These numbers make it easy to see that even a relatively modest annual inflation rate, lower than\nthe long-run annual US inflation rate of 3%, results in significant price increases.\n16\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Consumer Price Index.” US Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\n17\nChris Farrell. “The Truth About Health Care Costs in Retirement.” Forbes.

Both indices\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\ncorrelated.\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter.

Of course, DAL stock did not increase by exactly 13.65% each year. The returns\nfor DAL for each year are shown in Table 15.1. Some years, the return was much higher than 13.65%. In 2013,\nthe return was almost 133%!

The amount that the stock was worth at the end of each year is also\nshown in Table 15.1. During 2011, the return for DAL was −35.79%, resulting in the value of the investment\nfalling to\n.

Adding\neach of the annual returns and dividing the sum by 10 results in a 22.4% average annual return. This 22.4% is\ncalled the arithmetic average return.\nThe geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all\nyears are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in\nwhich you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%\nreturn the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of\n, but you will have a\ngeometric average return of\n. With a 50% positive return the\nfirst year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only\n$75.\nAnother important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not\nimportant. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced\na loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With\na −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a\npositive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A\nnegative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%",

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases.

In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for\nstocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative.

Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile.

This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple\nof the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\nEqual Annuity Approach\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate.

This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects.

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%.

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years. Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress. The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite\nsignificant.\nTable 17.7 shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry\ntend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure. With a debt weight of 63.62%, almost two-thirds\nof the capital for these companies comes from debt.\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (online)\n93.33%\n6.67% 1.16\n8.82%\n2.93%\n2.19% 8.38%\nComputers/peripherals\n91.45%\n8.55% 1.18\n8.92%\n3.71%\n1.88% 8.32%\nHousehold products\n87.07%\n12.93% 0.73\n6.65%\n5.06%\n2.19% 6.07%\nDrugs (pharmaceutical)\n84.62%\n15.38% 0.91\n7.54%\n1.88%\n2.19% 6.72%\nTable 17.7 Capital Structure, Cost of Debt, Cost of Equity, and WACC for Selected Industries (data source: Aswath\nDamodaran Online)\n522\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (general)\n82.41%\n17.59% 0.90\n7.49%\n12.48%\n1.88% 6.51%\nBeverages (soft)\n82.24%\n17.76% 0.79\n6.96%\n3.32%\n2.19% 6.11%\nTobacco\n76.74%\n23.26% 0.72\n6.61%\n8.69%\n1.88% 5.51%\nHomebuilding\n75.34%\n24.66% 1.46\n10.29%\n15.91%\n2.19% 8.30%\nFood processing\n75.18%\n24.82% 0.64\n6.18%\n8.56%\n2.19% 5.19%\nRestaurants/dining\n74.79%\n25.21% 1.34\n9.72%\n3.19%\n2.19% 7.82%\nApparel\n71.74%\n28.26% 1.10\n8.49%\n4.75%\n2.19% 6.71%\nFarming/agriculture\n68.94%",

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends. Equity capital can be raised through either retaining\nearnings or selling new shares of stock. Significant flotation costs are associated with issuing new shares of\nstock, making it the most expensive source of financing. Convertible debt allows the debt holders to convert\ntheir debt into a fixed number of common shares instead of receiving the face value of the stock at maturity.\nKey Terms\nafter-tax cost of debt\nthe net cost of interest on a company’s debt after taxes; the firm’s effective cost of\ndebt\ncapital\na company’s sources of financing\n17 • Summary\n529\ncapital structure\nthe percentages of a company’s assets that are financed by debt capital, preferred stock\ncapital, and common stock capital\nconversion price\nthe face value of a convertible bond divided by its conversion ratio\nconversion ratio\nthe number of shares of common stock receivable for each convertible bond that is\nconverted\nconvertible bonds\nbonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock upon\nmaturity\nfinancial distress\nwhen a firm has trouble meeting debt obligations\nfinancial leverage\nthe debt used in a company’s capital structure\nflotation costs\ncosts involved in the issuing and placing of new securities\ninterest tax shield\nthe reduction in taxes paid because interest payments on debt are a tax-deductible\nexpense; calculated as the corporate tax rate multiplied by interest payments\nlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has debt outstanding\nnet debt\na company’s total debt minus any cash or risk-free assets the company holds\npreferred stock\nequity capital that has a fixed dividend; preferred shareholders fall in between debt holders\nand common stockholders in the order of claimants\ntrade-off theory\na theory stating that the total value of a levered company is the value of the firm without\nleverage plus the value of the interest tax shield less financial distress costs\nunlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has no debt outstanding\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC)\nthe average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted\nby the fractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity\nCFA Institute\nThis chapter supports some of the Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) in this CFA® Level I Study Session",

            "chunk": "for future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people in\n18.3 • Pro Forma Financials\n545\nquarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.\nRecord-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future. The impacts of the pandemic are extremely\ndifficult to predict, making it a challenge for Big 5 Sporting Goods and other companies to assemble pro\nforma financial statements.\n(sources: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115470/0/en/Big-5-Sporting-Goods-\nCorporation-Announces-Record-Fiscal-2020-Third-Quarter-Results.html; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/\ninvestors-want-big-5-sporting-054658521.html; https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/accounting-audit/\nnews/21206691/four-ways-covid19-will-impact-2021-financial-forecasting-and-planning)\nDetermine Potential Changes in Variables\nSo far, we have focused on using historical common-size statements to create a draft (not a final version) of\nthe forecast. This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January\nof the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.\n•\nThe landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.\n•\nSome fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down\nby $25 per month beginning in April.\n•\nThere are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-\nobtain hunting supplies. Managers aren’t entirely sure of the full impact of the new legislation at this time,",

Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

Managers must be aware of\ndiffering business climates and customs and operate under multiple legal systems. Often, business must be\nconducted in multiple languages. Geopolitical events can impact business relationships. In addition, the\ncompany may receive cash flows and make payments in multiple currencies.\nExchange Rates\nThe costs to companies are impacted when the prices of the raw materials they use change. Very little coffee is\ngrown in the United States. This means that all of those coffee beans that Starbucks uses in its espresso\nmachines in Seattle, New York, Miami, and Houston were bought from suppliers outside of the United States.\nBrazil is the largest coffee-producing country, exporting about one-third of the world’s coffee.6 When a\ncompany purchases raw materials from a supplier in another country, the company needs not just money but\nthe money that is used in that country to make the purchase. Thus, the company is concerned about the\nexchange rate, or the price of the foreign currency.\nFigure 20.2 Brazilian Reals to One US Dollar7\nThe currency used in Brazil is called the Brazilian real. Figure 20.2 shows how many Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00 from 2010 through the first quarter of 2021. In March 2021, 5.4377 Brazilian reals could be\npurchased for $1.00. This will often be written in the form of\n6\nGlobal Agricultural Information Network. Brazil: Coffee Annual 2019. GAIN Report No. BR19006.

This price is known as a\ncurrency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nIf you know the price of $1.00 is 5.4377 Brazilian reals, you can easily find the price of Brazilian reals in US\ndollars. Simply divide both sides of the equation by 5.4377, or the price of the US dollar:\nIf you have US dollars and want to purchase Brazilian reals, it will cost you $0.1839 for each Brazilian real you\nwant to buy.\nThe foreign exchange rate changes in response to demand for and supply of the currency. In early 2020, the\nexchange rate was\n. In other words, $1 purchased fewer reals in early 2020 than in it did a\nyear later. Because you receive more reals for each dollar in 2021 than you would have a year earlier, the dollar\nis said to have appreciated relative to the Brazilian real. Likewise, because it takes more Brazilian reals to\npurchase $1.00, the real is said to have depreciated relative to the US dollar.\nExchange Rate Risks\nStarbucks, like other firms that are engaged in international business, faces currency exchange rate risk.\nChanges in exchange rates can impact a business in several ways. These risks are often classified as\ntransaction, translation, or economic risk.\nTransaction Risk\nTransaction risk is the risk that the value of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result\nof a change in currency exchange rates. If Starbucks agrees to pay a Brazilian coffee grower seven million\nBrazilian reals for an order of one million pounds of coffee beans, Starbucks will need to purchase Brazilian\nreals to pay the bill. How much it will cost Starbucks to purchase these Brazilian reals depends on the\nexchange rate at the time Starbucks makes the purchase.\nIn March 2021, with an exchange rate of\n, it would have cost Starbucks\nto purchase the reals needed to receive the one million pounds of coffee\nbeans. If, however, Starbucks agreed in March to purchase the coffee beans several months later, in July,\nStarbucks would not have known then what the exchange rate would be when it came time to complete the\ntransaction. Although Starbucks would have locked in a price of BRL 7,000,000 for one million pounds of coffee\nbeans, it would not have known what the coffee beans would cost the company in terms of US dollars.\nIf the US dollar appreciated so that it cost less to purchase each Brazilian real in July, Starbucks would find that\nit was paying less than $1,287,300 for the coffee beans. For example, suppose the dollar appreciated so that\nthe exchange rate was\nin July 2021. Then the coffee beans would only cost Starbucks\n.",

If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance. The loss is\ndue simply to changes in exchange rates and not the underlying profitability of the company.\nEconomic Risk\nEconomic risk is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers or its\nsales. Even a company that is not involved in international transactions can face this type of risk. Consider a\ncompany located in Mississippi that makes shirts using 100% US-grown cotton. All of the shirts are made in the\nUnited States and sold to retail outlets in the United States. Thus, all of the company’s expenses and revenues\nare in US dollars, and the company holds no assets outside of the United States.\nAlthough this firm has no financial transactions involving international currency, it can be impacted by\nchanges in exchange rates. Suppose the US dollar strengthens relative to the Vietnamese dong. This will allow\nUS retail outlets to purchase more Vietnamese dong, and thus more shirts from Vietnamese suppliers, for the\nsame amount of US dollars. Because of this, the retail outlets experience a drop in the cost of procuring the\nVietnamese shirts relative to the shirts produced by the firm in Mississippi. The Mississippi company will lose\nsome of its customers to these Vietnamese producers simply because of a change in the exchange rate.\nHedging\nJust as companies may practice hedging techniques to reduce their commodity risk exposure, they may\nchoose to hedge to reduce their currency risk exposure. The types of futures contracts that we discussed\nearlier in this chapter exist for currencies as well as for commodities. A company that knows that it will need\nKorean won later this year to purchase raw materials from a South Korean supplier, for example, can purchase\na futures contract for Korean won.\nWhile futures contracts allow companies to lock in prices today for a future commitment, these contracts are\nnot flexible enough to meet the risk management needs of all companies. Futures contracts are standardized\ncontracts. This means that the contracts have set sizes and maturity dates. Futures contracts for Korean won,\nfor example, have a contract size of 125 million won. A company that needs 200 million won later this year\nwould need to either purchase one futures contract, hedging only a portion of its needs, or purchase two\nfutures contracts, hedging more than it needs. Either way, the company has remaining currency risk.\nIn this next section, we will explore some additional hedging techniques.\nForward Contracts\nSuppose a company needs access to 200 million Korean won on March 1. In addition to a specified contract\nsize, currency futures contracts have specified days on which the contracts are settled. For most currency\nfutures contracts, this occurs on the third Wednesday of the month. If the company needed 125 million Korean\nwon (the basic contract size) on the third Wednesday of March (the standard settlement date), the futures\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n607\ncontract could be useful. Because the company needs a different number of Korean won on a different date\nfrom those specified in the standard contract, the futures contract is not going to meet the specific risk\nmanagement needs of the company.\nAnother type of contract, the forward contract, can be used by this company to meet its specific needs. A\nforward contract is simply a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange a specified amount of\ncurrencies at a future date. A company can approach its bank, for example, saying that it will need to purchase\n200 million Korean won on March 1. The bank will quote a forward rate, which is a rate specified today for the\nsale of currency on a future date, and the company and the bank can enter into a forward contract to\nexchange dollars for 200 million Korean won at the quoted rate on March 1.\nBecause a forward contract is a contract between two parties, those two parties can specify the amount that\nwill be traded and the date the trade will occur. This contract is similar to your agreeing with a hotel that you\nwill arrive on March 1 and rent a room for three nights at $200 per night. You are agreeing today to show up at\nthe hotel on a future (specified) date and pay the quoted price when you arrive. The hotel agrees to provide\nyou the room on March 1 and cannot change the price of the room when you arrive. With a forward contract,",

Options are considered derivative securities because the value of a derivative is\nderived from, or comes from, the value of another asset.\nOptions Terminology\nSpecific terminology is used in the finance industry to describe the details of an options contract. If the owner\nof an option decides to purchase or sell the asset according to the terms of the options contract, the owner is\nsaid to be exercising the option. The price the option holder pays if purchasing the asset or receives if selling\nthe asset is known as the strike price or exercise price. The price the owner of the option paid for the option is\nknown as the premium.\nAn option contract will have an expiration date. The most common kinds of options are American options,\nwhich allow the holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiration date. Holders of\nEuropean options may exercise their options only on the expiration date. The labels American option and\nEuropean option can be confusing as they have nothing to do with the location where the options are traded.\nBoth American and European options are traded worldwide.\nOption contracts are written for a variety of assets. The most common option contracts are options on shares\nof stock. Options are traded for US Treasury securities, currencies, gold, and oil. There are also options on\nagricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, cotton, and orange juice. Thus, options can be used by financial\nmanagers to hedge many types of risk, including currency risk, interest rate risk, and the risk that arises from\nfluctuations in the prices of raw materials.\nOptions are divided into two main categories, call options and put options. A call option gives the owner of\nthe option the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset. A put option gives the owner the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset.\nCall Options\nIf a Korean company knows that it will need pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months, it knows how\nmany US dollars it will need to pay the bill. As a Korean company, however, its bank account is denominated in\nKorean won. In six months, it will need to use its Korean won to purchase 100,000 US dollars.\nThe company can determine how many Korean won it would take to purchase $100,000 today. If the current\nexchange rate is\n, then it will need KWN 110,000,000 to pay the bill. The current\nexchange rate is known as the spot rate.\nThe company, however, does not need the US dollars for another six months. The company can purchase a call\noption, which is a contract that will allow it to purchase the needed US dollars in six months at a price stated in\nthe contract. This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price). Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised.

If the spot rate is between\nand\n, the payoff for the option is negative. For example, if the spot exchange rate is\n, the company will exercise the option and receive three more Indian rupees per dollar than\nit would in the spot market. However, the company had to spend INR 5 for the option, so the payoff is INR -2.\nAt a spot exchange rate of\n, the company has a zero payoff; the benefit of exercising the\noption, INR 5, is exactly equal to the price of purchasing the option, the premium of INR 5.\nIf, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything below\n, the payoff of the put option is\npositive. At the theoretical extreme, if the USD became worthless and would purchase no rupees in the spot\nmarket when the company received the dollars, the company could exercise its option and receive INR 75/USD,\nand its payoff would be INR 70.\nNow that we have considered the payoff to a purchaser of a put contract, let’s consider the opposite side of\nthe contract: the seller, or writer, of the put option. The writer of a put option is selling the right to sell dollars\nto the purchaser of the put option. The writer of the put option collects a premium for this. The writer of the\nput has no choice as to whether the put option will be exercised; the writer only has an obligation to honor the\ncontract if the owner of the put option chooses to exercise it.\nThe owner of the option will choose to let the option expire if the spot exchange rate is anything above\n. If that is the case, the writer of the put option collects the INR 5 premium for writing the\nput, as shown by the horizontal line in Figure 20.7.

In the extreme, the writer of\nthe put will have to purchase worthless US dollars for INR 75/USD, resulting in a loss of INR 70.\nNotice that the payoff to the writer of the put is the negative of the payoff to the holder of the put at every\nspot price. The highest payoff occurs to the writer of the put when the option is never exercised. In that\ninstance, the payoff to the writer is the premium that the holder of the put paid when purchasing the option\n(see Figure 20.7).\nTable 20.2 provides a summary of the positions that the parties who enter into options contract are in.\nRemember that the buyer of an option is always the one purchasing the right to do something.

Duration is an\nimportant measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as\nthe level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5",

However, from Beta’s perspective, the payment of LIBOR it receives from Alpha exactly offsets the\npayment of LIBOR it makes to its lender. When LIBOR increases, the rate of\nthat Beta is\npaying to its lender increases, but the LIBOR rate it receives from Alpha also increases.

It would have cost Alpha\nto borrow the money from its lenders at a variable rate.\nBy participating in this swap arrangement, Alpha has been able to lower its interest rate by 0.75%.\nThrough this swap arrangement, Beta has been able to fix its interest rate at 6.25% rather than having a\nvariable rate. This predictability is a benefit for a company, especially one that is in a bit more precarious\nposition as far as its creditworthiness and stability. The 6.25% Beta pays as a result of this arrangement is 0.5%\nbelow the 6.75% it would have paid if it simply borrowed from its lenders at a fixed rate.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n617\nSummary\n20.1 The Importance of Risk Management\nRisk arises due to uncertainty. The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has",
