Common law is formed through the decisions of courts in cases where there is no existing statutory or codified law to interpret. For example, a state court deciding the types of witnesses required for a valid will in the absence of a statutory rule is making common law. In contrast, statutory law is created through legislative processes and involves the interpretation of written laws and regulations. Common law evolves through judicial decisions and precedents, while statutory law is explicitly written and codified by legislative bodies."

                    "answer": "Psychological or nervous injury precipitated by psychic trauma is considered compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Law because there is no inherent distinction in the nature of stress or shock situations that would preclude physical injury from being compensated. The court's determination is based on the understanding that emotional stress or shock can cause physical injury, and thus, injuries resulting from such psychic trauma should be treated with the same level of compensation as physical injuries. This approach ensures that individuals suffering from psychological or nervous disorders due to psychic trauma receive fair compensation for their injuries."

                    "answer": "When measuring Gross Domestic Product (GDP), purchases are divided into four broad categories: consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports. Consumer spending refers to the total value of all goods and services consumed by households. Investment includes business expenditures on capital goods, such as machinery and buildings, as well as residential construction. Government spending encompasses all government consumption, investment, and transfer payments. Net exports are calculated by subtracting the value of a country's imports from its exports, representing the net trade balance. These categories collectively provide a comprehensive picture of a country's economic activity and are used to assess its economic performance."

Other large stock exchanges are located in Japan, China, Hong Kong,\ncontinental Europe, London, and Saudi Arabia.\nProcess of Offering Equities\nThe primary market is the market for new securities, and the secondary market is the market for used\nsecurities. When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time.

                    "answer": "An initial public offering (IPO) is the process by which a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker.

The investment banker plays a crucial role in this process by providing financial advice, recommending the price and number of shares to issue, and assisting with the overall process of going public. The investment banker's expertise helps the company navigate the complexities of the IPO process, ensuring that the company can successfully raise the necessary capital and enter the public market."
