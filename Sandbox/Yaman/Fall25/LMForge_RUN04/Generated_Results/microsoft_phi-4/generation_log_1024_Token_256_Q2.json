The Government may regulate corporate political speech through \ndisclaimer and disclosure requirements, but it may not suppress that speech altogether. We turn to the \ncase now before us. \nI \nA \nCitizens United is a nonprofit corporation. It has an annual budget of about $12 million. Most of its funds \nare from donations by individuals; but, in addition, it accepts a small portion of its funds from for-profit \ncorporations. \n \nIn January 2008, Citizens United released a film entitled Hillary: The Movie. We refer to the film \nas Hillary. It is a 90-minute documentary about then-Senator Hillary Clinton, who was a candidate in the \nDemocratic Party’s 2008 Presidential primary elections. Hillary mentions Senator Clinton by name and \ndepicts interviews with political commentators and other persons, most of them quite critical of Senator \nClinton.… \nIn December 2007, a cable company offered, for a payment of $1.2 million, to make Hillary available on a \nvideo-on-demand channel called “Elections ’08.”…Citizens United was prepared to pay for the video-on-\ndemand; and to promote the film, it produced two 10-second ads and one 30-second ad for Hillary. Each \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n192 \nad includes a short (and, in our view, pejorative) statement about Senator Clinton, followed by the name \nof the movie and the movie’s Website address. Citizens United desired to promote the video-on-demand \noffering by running advertisements on broadcast and cable television. \n \nB \nBefore the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), federal law prohibited—and still does \nprohibit—corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make direct contributions to \ncandidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, \nthrough any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections.…BCRA §203 amended \n§441b to prohibit any “electioneering communication” as well. An electioneering communication is \ndefined as “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate \nfor Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. §434(f)(3)(A). \nThe Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as \na communication that is “publicly distributed.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009). “In the case of a candidate \nfor nomination for President…publicly distributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received by \n50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election…is being held within 30 days.” 11 CFR \n§100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express \nadvocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a “separate segregated fund” \n(known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U.S.C. §441b(b)(2). The moneys \nreceived by the segregated fund are limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the \ncorporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union. Ibid. \n \n \nC \nCitizens United wanted to make Hillary available through video-on-demand within 30 days of the 2008 \nprimary elections. It feared, however, that both the film and the ads would be covered by §441b’s ban on \ncorporate-funded independent expenditures, thus subjecting the corporation to civil and criminal \npenalties under §437g. In December 2007, Citizens United sought declaratory and injunctive relief against \nthe FEC. It argued that (1) §441b is unconstitutional as applied to Hillary; and (2) BCRA’s disclaimer and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n193 \ndisclosure requirements, BCRA §§201 and 311, are unconstitutional as applied to Hillary and to the three \nads for the movie. \n \nThe District Court denied Citizens United’s motion for a preliminary injunction, and then granted the \nFEC’s motion for summary judgment. \n \n… \n \nThe court held that §441b was facially constitutional under McConnell, and that §441b was constitutional \nas applied to Hillary because it was “susceptible of no other interpretation than to inform the electorate \nthat Senator Clinton is unfit for office, that the United States would be a dangerous place in a President \nHillary Clinton world, and that viewers should vote against her.” 530 F. Supp. 2d, at 279. The court also \nrejected Citizens United’s challenge to BCRA’s disclaimer and disclosure requirements. It noted that “the \nSupreme Court has written approvingly of disclosure provisions triggered by political speech even though \nthe speech itself was constitutionally protected under the First Amendment.” Id. at 281. \n \nII \n[Omitted: the court considers whether it is possible to reject the BCRA without declaring certain \nprovisions unconstitutional. The court concludes it cannot find a basis to reject the BCRA that does not \ninvolve constitutional issues.] \n \n \nIII \nThe First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech.”",

Describe the paperwork burden imposed by administrative agencies. \n2. Explain why agencies have the power of investigation, and what limits there are to that power. \n3. Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of \nbusiness, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent \ntypes of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless \nfor purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So the FTC ordered dozens of \nlarge companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they \ncarried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nwhere much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n220 \ncomply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the \nagency to collect information for investigatory purposes. [1] \n \nIn 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being \nswamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives \npower to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for \ncoordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to \nthe scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information. These reports include tax and \nMedicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and \ntax and business records. The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of \ninformation are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must \nobtain the OMB’s approval. \n \nInspections \nNo one likes surprise inspections. A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers \nagents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety \nhazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required \nto obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an",

This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n227 \nFor many years, Charles earned considerably less than the ceiling amount. But then one year he got the \nopportunity to make some extra money. Not wishing to lose his pension, he called an employee relations \nspecialist in the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep his pension. The specialist \ngave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said \nCharles could safely take on the extra work. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary \nlimit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much. Charles sues to \nrecover his lost pension. He argues that he relied to his detriment on false information supplied by the \nnavy and that in fairness the government should be estopped from denying his claim. \n \nUnfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case. In Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, the \nSupreme Court reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit recovery. [4] The appropriations \nclause of Article I says that federal money can be paid out only through an appropriation made by law. \nThe law prevented this particular payment to be made. If the court were to make an exception, it would \npermit executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even though unauthorized, simply by \nmisrepresenting the facts. The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government are generally \nheld against the individual, not the government, unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, \nfor example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAfter exhausting administrative remedies, there are numerous grounds for seeking judicial review of an \nagency’s order or of a final rule. While courts defer to agencies to some degree, an agency must follow its own \nrules, comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, act within the scope of its delegated authority, avoid \nacting in an arbitrary manner, and make final rules that are supported by substantial evidence. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception.

In 1966, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists \n(ACGIH), a private organization, recommended that exposure to total cotton dust be limited to a \n“threshold limit value” of 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter of air (1,000 g/m3.) averaged over an 8-hour \nworkday. See 43 Fed. Reg. 27351, col. 1 (1978). The United States Government first regulated exposure to \ncotton dust in 1968, when the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to the Walsh-Healey Act, 41 U.S.C. 35 (e), \npromulgated airborne contaminant threshold limit values, applicable to public contractors, that included \nthe 1,000 g/m3 limit for total cotton dust. 34 Fed.

Soon thereafter, the Textile \nWorker’s Union of America, joined by the North Carolina Public Interest Research Group, petitioned the \nSecretary, urging a more stringent PEL of 100 g/m3. \n \nOn December 28, 1976, OSHA published a proposal to replace the existing federal standard on cotton dust \nwith a new permanent standard, pursuant to § 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655(b)(5). 41 Fed. Reg. \n56498. The proposed standard contained a PEL of 200 g/m3 of vertical elutriated lint-free respirable \ncotton dust for all segments of the cotton industry. Ibid. It also suggested an implementation strategy for \nachieving the PEL that relied on respirators for the short term and engineering controls for the long-term. \nOSHA invited interested parties to submit written comments within a 90-day period. \n \n* * * \n \nThe starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute itself. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \n§ 655(b)(5) (emphasis added), provides: \n \nThe Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical \nagents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, to the \nextent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the \nhazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. Although their \ninterpretations differ, all parties agree that the phrase “to the extent feasible” contains the critical \nlanguage in § 6(b)(5) for purposes of these cases. \n \nThe plain meaning of the word “feasible” supports respondents’ interpretation of the statute. According to \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), “feasible” means \n“capable of being done, executed, or effected.” In accord, the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n235 \n(“Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out”); Funk & Wagnalls New “Standard” Dictionary of \nthe English Language 903 (1957) (“That may be done, performed or effected”). Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the \nSecretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures…that no employee will suffer material",

It implies that while OSHA is directed to set the standard that most adequately assures no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity, this assurance must be achievable within the constraints of economic and technological feasibility.

A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat \ncommonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him. \n \nOffenses against Habitation and Other Offenses \nBurglary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n250 \nBurglary is not a crime against property. It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer \nunder § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 331 \n(k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943). Acme Markets, Inc., is a \nnational retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general \nwarehouses, and four special warehouses. Its headquarters, including the office of the president, \nrespondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been \nshipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore \nwarehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n272 \nrodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the \nfood’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § \n331 (k). \n \nAcme pleaded guilty to each count of the information. Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at \ntrial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by \nletter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar \nconditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning \nevidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of \nthe Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the \nwarehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been \nimprovement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building \nand in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” \n \nThe Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who \ninformed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection. \nThere was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on \nbehalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions \ndiscovered by both inspections. The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs \nand assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company \nand read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer. He testified that respondent \nfunctioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain \nthings, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of \nseeing that they all work together.” \n \nAt the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \nground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and \nDrug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 \n(1943), was controlling. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n273 \n \nRespondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating",

If the loss is partial (like partial loss of sight), the recovery is decreased \nby the percentage still usable. \n \nCoverage \nAlthough workers’ compensation laws are on the books of every state, in two states—New Jersey and \nTexas—they are not compulsory. In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership. There are also limited partnerships \nand limited liability partnerships, which are discussed in Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nTable 11.1 Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and Limited Liability \nCompanies \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006",

RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have \nconstructive notice from a filed “statement of dissociation.”[14] The dissociated partner, of course, is liable \nfor damages to the partnership if third parties had cause to think she was still a partner and the \npartnership became liable because of that; she is liable to the firm as an unauthorized agent.[15] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n518 \n \nA partner’s dissociation does nothing to change that partner’s liability for predissociation \nobligations. [16] For postdissociation liability, exposure is for two years if at the time of entering into the \ntransaction the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) didn’t have \nnotice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have constructive notice from a filed “statement of \ndissociation.” For example, Baker withdraws from the firm of Able, Baker, and Carr. Able contracts with \nHydroLift for a new hydraulic car lift that costs $25,000 installed. HydroLift is not aware at the time of \ncontracting that Baker is disassociated and believes she is still a partner. A year later, the firm not having \nbeen paid, HydroLift sues Able, Baker, and Carr and the partnership. Baker has potential liability. Baker \ncould have protected herself by filing a “statement of dissociation,” or—better—the partnership agreement \nshould provide that the firm would file such statements upon the dissociation of any partner (and if it \ndoes not, it would be liable to her for the consequences). \n \nDissolution \nDissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution (see the discussion later in this section of how the firm \ncontinues after a dissociation); dissolution and winding up happen only for the causes stated in RUPA \nSection 801, discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nThere are three causes of dissolution: (1) by act of the partners—some dissociations do trigger dissolution; \n(2) by operation of law; or (3) by court order. The partnership agreement may change or eliminate the \ndissolution trigger as to (1); dissolution by the latter two means cannot be tinkered with.[17] \n \n(1) Dissolution by act of the partners may occur as follows: \n \n• \nAny member of an at-will partnership can dissociate at any time, triggering dissolution and \nliquidation. The partners who wish to continue the business of a term partnership, though, cannot \nbe forced to liquidate the business by a partner who withdraws prematurely in violation of the \npartnership agreement. In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable.

That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed, \nthe entire agreement is silent as to the effect the formation of the projected corporation would have upon \nthe personal liability of Jenofsky and Graziano. Because the agreement fails to provide expressly for the \nrelease of personal liability, it is, therefore, subject to more than one possible construction. \n \nIn Consolidated Tile and Slate Co. v. Fox, 410 Pa. 336,339,189 A.2d 228, 229 (1963), we stated that where \nan agreement is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, “it must be construed most \nstrongly against those who drew it.”…Instantly, the chancellor determined that the intent of the parties to \nthe agreement was to hold Jenofsky personally responsible until such time as a corporate entity was \nformed and until such time as that corporate entity adopted the agreement. We believe this construction \nrepresents the only rational and prudent interpretation of the parties’ intent. \n \nAs found by the court below, this agreement was entered into on the financial strength of Jenofsky and \nGraziano, alone as individuals. Therefore, it would have been illogical for RKO to have consented to the \nrelease of their personal liability upon the mere formation of a resultant corporation prior to closing. For \nit is a well-settled rule that a contract made by a promoter, even though made for and in the name of a \nproposed corporation, in the absence of a subsequent adoption (either expressly or impliedly) by the \ncorporation, will not be binding upon the corporation. If, as Jenofsky contends, the intent was to release \npersonal responsibility upon the mere incorporation prior to closing, the effect of the agreement would \nhave been to create the possibility that RKO, in the event of non-performance, would be able to hold no \nparty accountable: there being no guarantee that the resultant corporation would ratify the agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n621 \nWithout express language in the agreement indicating that such was the intention of the parties, we may \nnot attribute this intention to them. \n \nTherefore, we hold that the intent of the parties in entering into this agreement was to have Jenofsky and \nGraziano personally liable until such time as the intended corporation was formed and ratified the \nagreement. [And there is no evidence that Kent Enterprises ratified the agreement. The decree is \naffirmed.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do \nnot want to avail themselves of these financing options. Instead, they seek to raise funds through \nprivate equity, which involves private investors providing funds to a company in exchange for an \ninterest in the company. A private equity firm is a group of investors who pool their money together for \ninvestment purposes, usually to invest in other companies. Looking to private equity firms is an option for \nstart-ups—companies newly formed or in the process of being formed—that cannot raise funds through \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n632 \nthe bond market or that wish to avoid debt or a public stock sale. Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off. Private equity investors may demand a significant interest in the firm, or a high return, \nto compensate them for the riskiness of their investment. They may demand a say in how the firm is \noperated or a seat on the board of directors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n633 \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are four main sources of corporate finance. The first is plowback, or reinvesting profits in the \ncorporation. The second is borrowing, commonly through a bond issue. A corporation sells a bond, agreeing to \nperiodic interest payments and repayment of the face value of the bond at maturity.

Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth. Improper purposes include uncovering trade \nsecrets for sale to a competitor or compiling mailing lists for personal business purposes. A shareholder’s \nmotivation is an important factor in determining whether the purpose is proper, as the courts attempt to \nbalance the rights of both the shareholders and the corporation. For example, a Minnesota court applied \nDelaware law in finding that a shareholder’s request to view the corporation’s shareholder ledger to \nidentify shareholders and communicate with them about the corporation’s involvement in the Vietnam \nWar was improper. A desire to communicate with the other corporate shareholders was found to be \ninsufficient to compel inspection. [2] Contrast that finding with a Delaware court’s finding that a \nshareholder had a proper purpose in requesting a corporation’s shareholder list in order to communicate \nwith them about the economic risks of the firm’s involvement in Angola. [3] \nPreemptive Rights \nAssume that BCT Bookstore has outstanding 5,000 shares with par value of ten dollars and that Carol \nowns 1,000. At the annual meeting, the shareholders decide to issue an additional 1,000 shares at par and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n678 \nto sell them to Alice. Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it. Preemptive rights were \nonce strongly favored, but they are increasingly disappearing, especially in large publicly held companies \nwhere ownership is already highly diluted. \n \nDerivative Actions \nSuppose Carol discovers that Ted has been receiving kickbacks from publishers and has been splitting the \nproceeds with Bob. When at a directors’ meeting, Carol demands that the corporation file suit to recover \nthe sums they pocketed, but Bob and Ted outvote her. Carol has another remedy. She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act. Although the corporation is named as a defendant in the \nsuit, the corporation itself is the so-called real party in interest—the party entitled to recover if the \nplaintiff wins. \n \nWhile derivative actions are subject to abuse by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking settlements that pay their \nfees, safeguards have been built into the law. At least ninety days before starting a derivative action, for \ninstance, shareholders must demand in writing that the corporation take action. Shareholders may not \ncommence derivative actions unless they were shareholders at the time of the wrongful act. Derivative \nactions may be dismissed if disinterested directors decide that the proceeding is not in the best interests \nof the corporation.

The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation \nand its directors, the plaintiff is also seeking injunctive relief, orders directing the admission of the \nplaintiff’s candidate to membership and denying indemnity to the directors, money damages, and costs \nand expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees. It should be noted at the outset that the plaintiff is not \nmaking a claim under either the federal or state civil rights or equal accommodations statutes, but that he \nis solely asserting his membership rights under the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, and the \nstatutes governing the regulation of this nonstock corporation. As such, this is a case of first impression in \nConnecticut. \n \n* * * \nConnecticut has codified the common-law right of a member to proceed against his corporation or its \ndirectors in the event of an ultra vires act. In fact, it has been done specifically under the Nonstock \nCorporation Act. \n \nNo powers were given to the defendant corporation in its certificate of incorporation, only a purpose, and \nas a result the only incidental powers which the defendant would have under the common law are those \nwhich are necessary to effect its purpose, that being to serve lunch to its members. Since the club was not \nformed for the purpose of having an exclusively male luncheon club, it cannot be considered necessary to \nits stated purpose for the club to have the implied power at common law to exclude women members. \n \nUnder the Connecticut Nonstock Corporation Act, the corporation could have set forth in its certificate of \nincorporation that its purpose was to engage in any lawful activity permitted that corporation. That was \nnot done. Its corporate purposes were very narrowly stated to be solely for providing “facilities for the \nserving of luncheon or other meals to members.” The certificate did not restrict the purpose to the serving \nof male members. Section 33-428 of the General Statutes provides that the corporate powers of a \nnonstock corporation are those set forth in the Nonstock Corporation Act, those specifically stated in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n700 \ncertificate of incorporation, neither of which includes the power to exclude women members, and the \nimplied power to “exercise all legal powers necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes \nstated in its certificate of incorporation.…” \n \nWe come, thus, to the nub of this controversy and the basic legal question raised by the facts in this case: \nIs it necessary or convenient to the purpose for which this corporation was organized for it to exclude \nwomen members? This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated",

Understand why commercial paper is an important concept in modern finance. \n2. Be familiar with the historical development of commercial paper. \n3. Recognize how commercial paper is viewed in economics and finance. \n \n \n \n \nThe Importance of Commercial Paper \nBecause commercial paper is a vital invention for the working of our economic system, brief attention to \nits history and its function as a medium of exchange in economics and finance is appropriate. \n \nThe Central Role of Commercial Paper \nCommercial paper is the collective term for various financial instruments, or tools, that include checks \ndrawn on commercial banks, drafts (drawn on something other than a bank), certificates of deposit, and \nnotes evidencing a promise to pay. Like money, commercial paper is a medium of exchange, but because it \nis one step removed from money, difficulties arise that require a series of interlocking rules to protect \nboth sellers and buyers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n775 \nTo understand the importance of commercial paper, consider the following example. It illustrates a \ndistinction that is critical to the discussion in our four chapters on commercial paper. \n \nLorna Love runs a tennis club. She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank.

By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870. The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption. This preemption could take \ntwo major forms. First, the Federal Reserve Board governs the activities of Federal Reserve Banks. As a \nresult, Federal Reserve regulations provide important guidelines for the check collection process. Second, \nArticle 3 of the UCC can be preempted by federal statutes. An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it. A \nmere transferee stands in the transferor’s shoes and takes the instrument subject to all the claims and \ndefenses against paying it that burdened it when the transferor delivered it. Negotiation is a special type of \ntransfer—voluntary or involuntary—to a holder. A holder is a person who has an instrument drawn, issued, or \nindorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank. If the instrument is order paper, negotiation is \naccomplished by indorsement and delivery to the next holder; if it is bearer paper or blank paper, delivery \nalone accomplishes negotiation. Transferors incur two types of liability: those who sign the instrument are \ncontractually liable; those who sign or those who do not sign are liable to the transferee in warranty. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

An indorsement is defined by \nUCC Section 3-204(a) as \n \na signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied \nby other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii)",

It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees. Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that \nalone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating \nthe instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on \nthe instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying \nwords is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n846 \nsignature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a \npurpose other than indorsement. \n \nThis paragraph was placed on the back of the check by the government as the maker or drawer of the \ncheck. Consequently, the bank argues that Gill as sole payee could waive, ignore or strike out the \nlanguage. \n \nAlthough the Louisiana jurisprudence contains no similar case dealing with the Uniform Commercial \nCode, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance…In [Citation, a New Jersey case] (1975), the drawer \nof a check placed instructions on the backs of several checks…that the instruments not be deposited until \na specific future date. However, the payee presented some of the checks prior to the date specified on the \nback. The court found that the drawer did not have the capacity to indorse the instruments; as a result the \ntyped instructions on the backs of the checks could not be indorsements. Instead, they were “merely \nrequests to plaintiff who may or may not comply at its own pleasure. The instructions are neither binding \non plaintiff nor the subsequent holders.” In other words, the payee could ignore the instructions. \n \nIn the instant case, the payee did precisely that. Gill ignored the writing on the back of the check and \ninstructed the teller at the defendant bank to do the same through verbal and written instructions. \n \nWisner argues that by affixing his signature under the writing on the back of the check, Gill made it his \nown indorsement. Furthermore, it asserts that it was a restrictive indorsement, not a conditional one \nwhich could be disregarded pursuant to 3-206. Wisner relies upon the provisions of 3-206 for the \nproposition that the check had a restrictive indorsement and that the bank converted the check because it \nfailed to apply the amount it paid consistently with the indorsement. However, Comment 3 to 3-206 \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \nThis Article does not displace the law of waiver as it may apply to restrictive indorsements. The \ncircumstances under which a restrictive indorsement may be waived by the person who made it \nis not determined by this Article. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n847 \n \nNot all jurisdictions recognize a doctrine of waiver of restrictive indorsements. [Citing cases from various \njurisdictions in which a bank customer effectively requested the bank to disregard a restrictive \nindorsement; some cases affirmed the concept that the restriction could be waived (disregarded), others \ndid not.] \n \n… \n \nIn two cases arising under pre-UCC law, Louisiana recognized that indorsements could be ignored or \nstruck out. In [Citation] (1925), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that the holder of a check could erase \nor strike out a restrictive indorsement on a check that was not necessary to the holder’s title. In [Citation] \n(1967), the court stated that an erroneous indorsement could be ignored and even struck out as \nunnecessary to the plaintiff’s title. \n \nLike the trial court, we find that when Gill affixed his signature under the writing on the back of the check, \nhe made it his own indorsement. We further find that the indorsement was restrictive, not conditional. As \nGill’s own restrictive indorsement, he could waive it and direct that the check, upon which he was \ndesignated as the sole payee, be deposited in his account in its entirety. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS",

But Bank insists that an accommodation \nparty also become liable to pay the note (by signing it as a co-maker or by indorsing the note). In \nsuretyship law, the accommodation party is a “Surety.” Then Bank agrees to a modification of the \nrights and obligations between it and Principal Debtor, such as agreeing that she may pay the \nnote at some date after the due date, or that she may discharge her $10,000 obligation to pay the \nnote by paying Bank $3,000, or the Bank releases collateral she gave it to secure the note. Surety \nis discharged if changes like this are made by Bank (the creditor) without Surety’s consent to the \nextent Surety suffers loss as a result. Section 3-605 is concerned with this kind of problem with \nPrincipal Debtor and Surety. But it has a wider scope: it also applies to indorsers who are not \naccommodation parties. Unless an indorser signs without recourse, the indorser’s liability under \nsection 3-415(a) is that of a surety. If Bank in our hypothetical case indorsed the note and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n911 \ntransferred it to Second Bank, Bank has rights given to an indorser under section 3-605 if it is \nSecond Bank that modifies rights and obligations of Borrower. \n \nDischarge by Reacquisition \nSuppose a prior party reacquires the instrument. He may—but does not automatically—cancel any \nindorsement unnecessary to his title and may also reissue or further negotiate the instrument. Any \nintervening party is thereby discharged from liability to the reacquiring party or to any subsequent holder \nnot in due course. If an intervening party’s indorsement is cancelled, she is not liable even to an HDC.

Anything that would \ndischarge a debt under common contract law will do so. More specifically as to commercial paper, of course, \npayment discharges the obligation. Other methods include tender of payment, cancellation or renunciation, \nmaterial and fraudulent alteration, certification, acceptance varying a draft, reacquisition, and—in some \ncases—unexcused delay in giving notice of presentment or dishonor. Indorsers and accommodation parties’ \nliability may be discharged by the same means that a surety’s liability is discharged, to the extent that \nalterations in the agreement between the creditor and the holder would be defenses to a surety because right \nof recourse is impaired to the surety. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

After being informed by both [Respondent’s] teller and \nbranch manager that it was [Respondent’s] policy not to cash a non-account holder’s check \nwithout a thumbprint signature, [Petitioner] left the bank with the check in hand. \n \nBecause [Petitioner] gave the check to the teller, [Respondent’s] possession of that check was \nanything but “unauthorized,” and having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to \n[Petitioner] for his thumbprint signature, [Respondent] never exercised “dominion and control \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n921 \n[over it] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,” [Petitioner]. In short, there was no \nconversion. \n \nD. “Reasonable Identification” under § 3-501(b)(2)(ii) and “Dishonor” under § 3-502 \n \nWe now turn to the issue of whether the Bank’s refusal to accept the check as presented constituted \ndishonor under § 3-501 and § 3-502 as Petitioner contends. Petitioner’s argument that Bank of America \ndishonored the check under § 3-502(d) fails because that section applies to dishonor of an accepted draft. \nWe have determined, supra, [above] that Bank of America never accepted the draft. Nevertheless, the \nquestion remains as to whether Bank of America dishonored the draft under § 3-502(b)… \n \n(2) Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment \nmust (i) exhibit the instrument, (ii) give reasonable identification… \n \n(3) Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may (i) return \nthe instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement, or (ii) refuse payment or acceptance for \nfailure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the \nparties, or other applicable law or rule. \n \nThe question is whether requiring a thumbprint constitutes a request for “reasonable identification” \nunder § 3-501(b)(2)(ii). If it is “reasonable,” then under § 3-501(b)(3)(ii) the refusal of the Bank to accept \nthe check from Petitioner did not constitute dishonor. If, however, requiring a thumbprint is not \n“reasonable” under § 3-501(b)(2)(ii), then the refusal to accept the check may constitute dishonor under § \n3-502(b)(2). The issue of dishonor is arguably relevant because Petitioner has no cause of action against \nany party, including the drawer, until the check is dishonored. \n \nRespondent Bank of America argues that its relationship with its customer is contractual, [Citations] and \nthat in this case, its contract with its customer, the drawer, authorizes the Bank’s use of the Thumbprint \nSignature Program as a reasonable form of identification. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n922 \n \nAccording to Respondent, this contractual agreement allowed it to refuse to accept the check, without \ndishonoring it pursuant to § 3-501(b)(3)(ii), because the Bank’s refusal was based upon the presentment \nfailing to comply with “an agreement of the parties.” The intermediate appellate court agreed. We, \nhowever, do not. \n \n…Bank and its customer cannot through their contract define the meaning of the term “reasonable” and \nimpose it upon parties who are not in privity with that contract. Whether requiring a thumbprint \nconstitutes “reasonable identification” within the meaning of § 3-501(b)(2)(ii) is therefore a broader \npolicy consideration, and not, as argued in this case, simply a matter of contract. We reiterate that the \ncontract does not apply to Petitioner and, similarly, does not give him a cause of action against the Bank \nfor refusing to accept the check. This also means that the Bank cannot rely on the contract as a defense \nagainst the Petitioner, on the facts presented here, to say that it did not dishonor the check. \n \nPetitioner, as noted, argues that requiring a thumbprint violates his privacy, and further argues that a \nthumbprint is not a reasonable form of identification because it does not prove contemporaneously the \nidentity of an over the counter presenter at the time presentment is made. According to Petitioner, the \npurpose of requiring “reasonable identification” is to allow the drawee bank to determine that the \npresenter is the proper person to be paid on the instrument. Because a thumbprint does not provide that \ninformation at the time presentment and payment are made, Petitioner argues that a thumbprint cannot \nbe read to fall within the meaning of “reasonable identification” for the purposes of § 3-501(b)(2)(ii). \n \nBank of America argues that the requirement of a thumbprint has been upheld, in other non-criminal \ncircumstances, not to be an invasion of privacy, and is a reasonable and necessary industry response to \nthe growing problem of check fraud.

PNC moves for summary judgment on both counts. \n \nII. Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault. [Citation] Martin, in any event, fails to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n928 \nsupport Friedman’s and Jennewein’s statements with firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits, so the \nstatements do not qualify as competent evidence. [Citation] \n \nMartin claims that the risk of loss falls on the bank. But the cases Martin cites in support of that \nproposition suffer from two defects. First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930]. The one modern case that Martin cites is also inapposite because the case involves a \ndrawer and a drawee bank. [Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card.

In the end, who probably really suffered the loss here? \nCustomer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements \nCommerce Bank of Delaware v. Brown \n2007 WL 1207171 (Del. Com. Pl. 2007) \n \nI. Procedural Posture \nPlaintiff, Commerce Bank/Delaware North America (“Commerce”) initially filed a civil complaint against \ndefendant Natasha J. Brown (“Brown”) on October 28, 2005. Commerce seeks judgment in the amount of \n$4.020.11 plus costs and interest and alleges that Brown maintained a checking account with Commerce \nand has been unjustly enriched by $4,020.11.… \n \nThe defendant, Brown…denied all allegations of the complaint. As an affirmative defense Brown claims \nthe transaction for which plaintiff seeks to recover a money judgment were made by means of an ATM \nMachine using a debit card issued by the defendant. On January 16, 2005 Brown asserts that she became \naware of the fraudulent transactions and timely informed the plaintiff of the facts on January 16, 2005. \nBrown asserts that she also requested Commerce in her answer to investigate the matter and to close her \naccount. Based upon these facts, Brown asserts a maximum liability on her own part from $50.00 to \n$500.00 in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) 15 U.S.C. § 1693(g) and regulation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n976 \n(e), 12 CFR 205.6. [Commerce Bank withdrew its complaint at trial, leaving only the defendant’s counter-\nclaim in issue.] \n \nDefendant Brown asserts [that] defendant failed to investigate and violated EFTA and is therefore liable \nto the plaintiff for money damages citing [EFTA]. \n \nII. The Facts \nBrown was the only witness called at trial. Brown is twenty-seven years old and has been employed by \nWilmington Trust as an Administrative Assistant for the past three years. Brown previously opened a \nchecking account with Commerce and was issued a debit/ATM card by Commerce which was in her \npossession in December 2004. Brown, on or about January 14, 2005 went to Commerce to charge a $5.00 \ndebit to the card at her lunch-break was informed that there was a deficiency balance in the checking \naccount. Brown went to the Talleyville branch of Commerce Bank and spoke with “Carla” who agreed to \ninvestigate these unauthorized charges, as well as honor her request to close the account. Defendant’s \nExhibit No.: 1 is a Commerce Bank electronic filing and/or e-mail which details a visit by defendant on \nJanuary 16, 2005 to report her card loss. The “Description of Claim” indicates as follows: \n \nCustomer came into speak with a CSR “Carla Bernard” on January 16, 2005 to report her card \nloss. At this time her account was only showing a negative $50.00 balance. She told Ms. Bernard \nthat this was not her transaction and to please close this account. Ms. Bernard said that she \nwould do this and that there would be an investigation on the unauthorized transactions. It was \nat this time also that she had Ms. Bernard change her address. In the meantime, several \ntransactions posted to the account causing a balance of negative $3,948.11 and this amount has",

Rosa seeks damages, attorney’s fees, and injunctive \nrelief. \n \nWithout filing an answer to the complaint, the Bank moved to dismiss.…The district court granted the \nBank’s motion. The court stated: \n \n[T]he issue in this case is not [Rosa’s] sex, but rather how he chose to dress when applying for a \nloan. Because the Act does not prohibit discrimination based on the manner in which someone \ndresses, Park West’s requirement that Rosa change his clothes does not give rise to claims of \nillegal discrimination. Further, even if Park West’s statement or action were based upon Rosa’s \nsexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation, the Act does not prohibit such discrimination. \n \nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins (U.S. Supreme Court, 1988), which Rosa relied on, was not to the contrary, \naccording to the district court, because that case “neither holds, nor even suggests, that discrimination \nbased merely on a person’s attire is impermissible.” \n \nOn appeal, Rosa says that the district court “fundamentally misconceived the law as applicable to the \nPlaintiff’s claim by concluding that there may be no relationship, as a matter of law, between telling a \nbank customer what to wear and sex discrimination.” …The Bank says that Rosa loses for two reasons. \nFirst, citing cases pertaining to gays and transsexuals, it says that the ECOA does not apply to \ncrossdressers. Second, the Bank says that its employee genuinely could not identify Rosa, which is why \nshe asked him to go home and change. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1007 \nIII. \n…In interpreting the ECOA, this court looks to Title VII case law, that is, to federal employment \ndiscrimination law.…The Bank itself refers us to Title VII case law to interpret the ECOA. \n \nThe ECOA prohibits discrimination, “with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction[,] on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age.” 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a). Thus to prevail, the \nalleged discrimination against Rosa must have been “on the basis of…sex.” See [Citation.] The ECOA’s sex \ndiscrimination prohibition “protects men as well as women.” \n \nWhile the district court was correct in saying that the prohibited bases of discrimination under the ECOA \ndo not include style of dress or sexual orientation, that is not the discrimination alleged. It is alleged that \nthe Bank’s actions were taken, in whole or in part, “on the basis of… [the appellant’s] sex.” The Bank, by \nseeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), subjected itself to rigorous standards. We may affirm dismissal \n“only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with \nthe allegations.” [Citations] Whatever facts emerge, and they may turn out to have nothing to do with sex-\nbased discrimination, we cannot say at this point that the plaintiff has no viable theory of sex \ndiscrimination consistent with the facts alleged. \n \nThe evidence is not yet developed, and thus it is not yet clear why Brunelle told Rosa to go home and \nchange. It may be that this case involves an instance of disparate treatment based on sex in the denial of \ncredit. See [Citation]; (“‘Disparate treatment’…is the most easily understood type of discrimination. The \nemployer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their…sex.”); [Citation] \n(invalidating airline’s policy of weight limitations for female “flight hostesses” but not for similarly \nsituated male “directors of passenger services” as impermissible disparate treatment); [Citation] \n(invalidating policy that female employees wear uniforms but that similarly situated male employees need \nwear only business dress as impermissible disparate treatment); [Citation] (invalidating rule requiring \nabandonment upon marriage of surname that was applied to women, but not to men). It is reasonable to \ninfer that Brunelle told Rosa to go home and change because she thought that Rosa’s attire did not accord \nwith his male gender: in other words, that Rosa did not receive the loan application because he was a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1008 \nman, whereas a similarly situated woman would have received the loan application. That is, the Bank may \ntreat, for credit purposes, a woman who dresses like a man differently than a man who dresses like a \nwoman. If so, the Bank concedes, Rosa may have a claim. Indeed, under Price Waterhouse, “stereotyped \nremarks [including statements about dressing more ‘femininely’] can certainly be evidence that gender \nplayed a part.” [Citation.] It is also reasonable to infer, though, that Brunelle refused to give Rosa the loan",

Recognize, most generally, the two methods by which debtors’ obligations may be secured. \n2. Know the source of law for personal property security. \n3.

Understand how the security interest is created—”attached”—and perfected. \n \n \n \nThe Problem of Security \nCreditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor. An oral promise to pay is no security at \nall, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate.",

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.

            "chunk": "with nothing. Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

Prior to signing the lease, Powder Coaters negotiated the terms with Mark \nTaylor, (“Taylor”) who was the property manager for the warehouse facility and an agent of BG Holding. \n \nThe warehouse facility did not have a sufficient power supply to support Powder Coaters’ machinery. \nTherefore, Powder Coaters contracted with F & D Electrical (“F & D”) to perform electrical work which \nincluded installing two eight foot strip light fixtures and a two hundred amp load center. Powder Coaters \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1105 \nnever paid F & D for the services. Powder Coaters was also unable to pay rent to BG Holding and was \nevicted in February 1997. Powder Coaters is no longer a viable company. \n \nIn January 1997, F & D filed a Notice and Certificate of Mechanic’s Lien and Affidavit of Mechanic’s Lien. \nIn February 1997, F & D filed this action against BG Holding foreclosing on its mechanic’s lien pursuant to \nS.C. [statute].… \n \nA jury trial was held on September 2nd and 3rd, 1998. At the close of F & D’s evidence, and at the close of \nall evidence, BG Holding made motions for directed verdicts, which were denied. The jury returned a \nverdict for F & D in the amount of $8,264.00. The court also awarded F & D attorneys’ fees and cost in the \namount of $8,264.00, for a total award of $16,528.00. \n \nBG Holding appealed. The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, reversed the trial court, holding a \ndirected verdict should have been granted to BG Holding on the grounds BG Holding did not consent to \nthe electrical upgrade, as is required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute. This Court granted F & D’s petition \nfor certiorari, and the issue before this Court is: \nDid the trial court err in denying BG Holding’s motion for directed verdict because the record \nwas devoid of any evidence of owner’s consent to materialman’s performance of work on its \nproperty as required by [the S.C. statute]? \n \nLaw/Analysis \nF & D argues the majority of the Court of Appeals erred in holding the facts of the case failed to establish \nthat BG Holding consented to the work performed by F & D, as is required by the [South Carolina] \nMechanic’s Lien Statute. We agree. \n… \n \nSouth Carolina’s Mechanic’s Lien Statute provides: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1106 \nA person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and \nactually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building…by virtue of an agreement with, \nor by consent of, the owner of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or \nrightfully acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have a lien \nupon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or structure …to \nsecure the payment of the debt due. [emphasis added.] \n \nBoth parties in this case concede there was no express “agreement” between F & D and BG Holding. \nTherefore, the issue in this appeal turns on the meaning of the word “consent” in the statute, as applied in \nthe landlord-tenant context. This is a novel issue in South Carolina. \n \nThis Court must decide who must give the consent, who must receive consent, and what type of consent \n(general, specific, oral, written) must be given in order to satisfy the statute. Finally, the Court must \ndecide whether the evidence in this case shows BG Holding gave the requisite consent. \n \nA. Who Must Receive the Consent. \nThe Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case contemplates the consent must be between the materialman \n(lien claimant) and the landlord (owner). “It is only logical…that consent under [the relevant section] \nmust…be between the owner and the entity seeking the lien…” [Citation from Court of Appeals]. As stated \npreviously, applying the Mechanic’s Lien Statute in the landlord-tenant context presents a novel issue. We \nfind the consent required by the statute does not have to be between the landlord/owner and the \nmaterialman, as the Court of Appeals’ opinion indicates. A determination that the required consent must \ncome from the owner to the materialman means the materialman can only succeed if he can prove an \nagreement with the owner. Such an interpretation would render meaningless the language of the statute \nthat provides: “…by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of the owner.…\" \n \nTherefore, it is sufficient for the landlord/owner or his agent to give consent to his tenant. The \nlandlord/owner should be able to delegate to his tenant the responsibility for making the requested \nimprovements. The landlord/owner may not want to have direct involvement with the materialman or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1107 \nsub-contractors, but instead may wish to allow the tenant to handle any improvements or upgrades \nhimself. In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away and may own many properties, making \nit impractical for him to have direct involvement with the materialman. We find the landlord/owner or his",

            "chunk": "creditor, or a holder of equity in the debtor’s property may file a plan. If the court does appoint a trustee, \nany party in interest may file a plan at any time. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act specifies certain features of the plan and permits others to be included. \nAmong other things, the plan must (1) designate classes of claims and ownership interests; (2) specify \nwhich classes or interests are impaired—a claim or ownership interest is impaired if the creditor’s legal, \nequitable, contractual rights are altered under the plan; (3) specify the treatment of any class of claims or \ninterests that is impaired under the plan; (4) provide the same treatment of each claim or interests of a \nparticular class, unless the holder of a particular claim or interest agrees to a less favorable treatment; and \n(5) provide adequate means for carrying out the plan. Basically, what the plan does is provide a process \nfor rehabilitating the company’s faltering business by relieving it from repaying part of its debt and \ninitiating reforms so that the company can try to get back on its feet. \n \nAcceptance of the Plan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1151 \nThe act requires the plan to be accepted by certain proportions of each impaired class of claims and \ninterests. A class of claims accepts the plan if creditors representing at least two-thirds of the dollar \namount of claims and more than one-half the number of allowed claims vote in favor. A class of property \ninterests accepts the plan if creditors representing two-thirds of the dollar amount of the allowed \nownership interests vote in favor. Unimpaired classes of claims and interest are deemed to have accepted \nthe plan; it is unnecessary to solicit their acceptance. \n \nConfirmation of the Plan \nThe final act necessary under Chapter 11 is confirmation by the court. Once the court confirms the plan, \nthe plan is binding on all creditors. The rules governing confirmation are complex, but in essence, they \ninclude the following requirements: \n1. The plan must have been proposed in good faith. Companies must also make a good-faith attempt to \nnegotiate modifications in their collective bargaining agreements (labor union contracts). \n2. All provisions of the act must have been complied with. \n3. The court must have determined that the reorganized business will be likely to succeed and be \nunlikely to require further financial reorganization in the foreseeable future. \n4. Impaired classes of claims and interests must have accepted the plan, unless the plan treats them in a \n“fair and equitable” manner, in which case consent is not required. This is sometimes referred to as \nthe cram-down provision. \n5. All members of every class must have received no less value than they would have in Chapter 7 \nliquidation. \n \nDischarge, Conversion \nThe debtor gets discharged when all payments under the plan are completed. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy \nmay be converted to Chapter 7, with some restrictions, if it turns out the debtor cannot make the plan \nwork. \n \nAdjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income: Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1152 \nIn General \nAnyone with a steady income who is having difficulty paying off accumulated debts may seek the \nprotection of a bankruptcy court in Chapter 13 proceeding (often called the wage earner’s plan). Under \nthis chapter, the individual debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court appoints a trustee. \nIf the creditors wind up with more under the plan presented than they would receive in Chapter 7 \nproceeding, then the court is likely to approve it. In general, a Chapter 13 repayment plan extends the \ntime to pay the debt and may reduce it so that the debtor need not pay it all. Typically, the debtor will pay \na fixed sum monthly to the trustee, who will distribute it to the creditors. The previously discussed \nprovisions of Chapters 3 and 5 apply also to this chapter; therefore, the discussion that follows focuses on \nsome unique features of Chapter 13. \nPeople seek Chapter 13 discharges instead of Chapter 7 for various reasons: they make too much money to \npass the Chapter 7 means test; they are behind on their mortgage or car payments and want to make them \nup over time and reinstate the original agreement; they have debts that can’t be discharged in Chapter 7; \nthey have nonexempt property they want to keep; they have codebtors on a personal debt who would be \nliable if the debtor went Chapter 7; they have a real desire to pay their debts but cannot do so without \ngetting the creditors to give them some breathing room. Chapter 7 cases may always be converted to \nChapter 13. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nChapter 13 is voluntary only. Anyone—sole proprietorships included—who has a regular income, \nunsecured debts of less than $336,000, and secured debts of less than $1,010,650 is eligible to seek its \nprotection.

BAP, (Idaho, 2008) \n \nOn July 13, 1995, Ryan was convicted of possession of an unregistered firearm under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) \nin the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. Ryan was sentenced to fifty-seven months in \nprison followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, Ryan was ordered to pay a fine of \n$7,500…, costs of prosecution in the amount of $83,420, and a special assessment of $50.00. Ryan served \nhis sentence. He also paid the $7,500 fine. The district court, following an appellate mandate, ultimately \neliminated the restitution obligation. \n \nOn April 25, 2003, Ryan filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 7 in the District of Idaho. He \nreceived his chapter 7 discharge on August 11, 2003. Shortly thereafter, Ryan filed a case under chapter \n13, listing as his only obligation the amount of unpaid costs of prosecution owed to the United States \n(“Government”).… \n \nRyan completed payments under the plan, and an “Order of Discharge” was entered on October 5, 2006. \nThe chapter 13 trustee’s final report reflected that the Government received $2,774.89 from payments \nmade by Ryan under his plan, but a balance of $77,088.34 on the Government’s costs of prosecution \nclaim remained unpaid. Ryan then renewed his request for determination of dischargeability. The \nbankruptcy court held that the unpaid portion of the Government’s claim for costs of prosecution was \nexcepted from discharge by § 1328(a)(3). Ryan appealed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1168 \n \nSection 1328(a)(3) provides an exception to discharge in chapter 13 for “restitution, or a criminal fine.” It \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \n[A]s soon as practicable after the completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, the \ncourt shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under \nsection 502 of this title except any debt… \n \n(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime \n[.] [emphasis added]. \n \nThe essential question, then, is whether these costs of prosecution constitute a “criminal fine.” \n \nStatutory interpretation begins with a review of the particular language used by Congress in the relevant \nversion of the law. [Citation.] \n \nThe term “criminal fine” is not defined in [Chapter 13] or anywhere else in the Bankruptcy Code. \nHowever, its use in § 1328(a)(3) implicates two important policies embedded in the Bankruptcy Code. \nFirst, in light of the objective to provide a fresh start for debtors overburdened by debts that they cannot \npay, exceptions to discharge are interpreted strictly against objecting creditors and in favor of \ndebtors. See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation. \n \n“[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy \njudgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over \nthree years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, \nperhaps for the rest of their lives.” [Citations.] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1169 \n \nA second, countervailing policy consideration is a historic deference, both in the Bankruptcy Code and in \nthe administration of prior bankruptcy law, to excepting criminal sanctions from discharge in bankruptcy. \nApplication of this policy is consistent with a general recognition that, “[t]he principal purpose of the \nBankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’” [Citation] (emphasis \nadded [in original]). \n \nThe legislative history is clear that [in its 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law] Congress intended to \noverrule the result in [of a 1990 Supreme Court case so that]:…“[N]o debtor with criminal restitution \nobligations will be able to discharge them through any bankruptcy proceeding.”… \n \nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant \nto pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a \nspecial fund for victims’ compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury.… \n \nTo honor the principle that exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly in favor of debtors, \nparticularly in chapter 13, where a broad discharge was provided by Congress as an incentive for debtors \nto opt for relief under that chapter rather than under chapter 7, it is not appropriate to expand the scope \nof the [Chapter 13] exception beyond the terms of the statute. Congress could have adopted an exception",

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget.

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect. FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and",

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year.

In addition, the debt is decreasing slowly in the early months and more rapidly in the later\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n241\nmonths. We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the\nremaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula.

The practice of offering such loans can be controversial because it can lead to\nvery high rates of interest, perhaps even illegally high, in an act known as usury. Although some states have\noutlawed PALs and others place limits on them, some do not. A PAL is a short-term loan in anticipation of a\nperson’s next paycheck. A person in need of money for short-term needs will write a check on Thursday but\ndate the check next Thursday, which is their normal payday; assume this transaction is for $200. The lender,\ntypically operating from a storefront, will advance the $200 cash and hold the postdated check. The lender\ncharges a fee—let’s say $14—as their compensation. The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay\noff the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient\nfunds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.\nOne primary reason that arrangements such as these are controversial is the excessively high nominal (stated)\ninterest rate that they can represent. For a one-week loan of $200, the borrower is paying $14, or 7% of the\nborrowed amount. If this is annualized, with 52 seven-day periods in a year, the stated rate is 364%! While a\nPAL might seem to be an effective immediate solution to a cash shortfall, the mathematics behind the true\ncost of borrowing simply do not make sense, and a person who uses such arrangements regularly is placing\nthemselves at a dreadful financial disadvantage.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nHow Tempting Is That Refund Anticipation?\nRefund anticipation loans (RALs) began in 1987, and they are still available (though not from banks) and\nused by millions of people.1 Now, RALs come from private lending chains. These loans allow you to\ndetermine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against\nyour expected refund.2 But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized! We assumed no\ncompounding to keep the illustration simple, but we further assume that you are not using this advance\nthroughout the year. If you were, then periodic compounding would drive the effective rate even higher, to\njust over 29.3%.\n1\nMichelle Singletary. “Another Reason Not to Opt for a Tax Refund Loan: It May Delay Your Next Stimulus Payment.” Washington\nPost, February 16, 2021. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/16/tax-refund-loan-problems/\n2\nAmelia Josephson. “What Is a Refund Anticipation Loan?” SmartAsset.

(credit: modification of “US Treasury Checks - 3D Illustration” by\nDonkeyHotey/flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nChapter Outline\n10.1 Characteristics of Bonds\n10.2 Bond Valuation\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nWhy It Matters\nWhen an investor purchases a bond, that person is, for all intents and purposes, making a loan to the bond\nissuer. Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\nRecession.\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\nFigure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average\nannual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period\nfrom 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual\npremium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.\nThese premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor\nplaced $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end\n2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506\non a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (see Figure 12.12).\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n367\nFigure 12.9 Treasury Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.10 Baa Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.11 Baa Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\n368\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.12 Baa Bonds versus T-Bonds Performance, 1980–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nProfile of Bill Gross\nBill Gross may be the most successful fixed-income investor ever, but he is also a prime example of the\napplication of the efficient market theory.

In some data sets, the data values are\nconcentrated close to the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out. For example,\nan investor might examine the yearly returns for Stock A, which are 1%, 2%, -1%, 0%, and 3%, and compare\nthem to the yearly returns for Stock B, which are -9%, 2%, 15%, -5%, and 0%.\nNotice that Stock B exhibits more volatility in yearly returns than Stock A. The investor may want to quantify\nthis variation in order to make the best investment decisions for a particular investment objective.\nThe most common measure of variation, or spread, is standard deviation. The standard deviation of a data\nset is a measure of how far the data values are from their mean. A standard deviation\n•\nprovides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set; and\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n385\n•\ncan be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.\nThe standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set. The standard deviation is\nalways positive or zero. It is small when the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little\nvariation or spread. It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\nvariation.\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B. The average stock\nprice for both stocks is $5. For Stock A, the standard deviation of the stock price is 2, whereas the standard\ndeviation for Stock B is 4. Because Stock B has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more\nvariation in the stock price for Stock B than in the price for Stock A.\nThere are two different formulas for calculating standard deviation. Which formula to use depends on whether\nthe data represents a sample or a population. The notation s is used to represent the sample standard\ndeviation, and the notation\nis used to represent the population standard deviation. In the formulas shown\nbelow, x̄ is the sample mean,\nis the population mean, n is the sample size, and N is the population size.\nFormula for the sample standard deviation:\nFormula for the population standard deviation:\nVariance\nVariance also provides a measure of the spread of data values. The variance of a data set measures the extent\nto which each data value differs from the mean. The more the individual data values differ from the mean, the\nlarger the variance. Both the standard deviation and the variance provide similar information.\nIn a finance application, variance can be used to determine the volatility of an investment and therefore to\nhelp guide financial decisions. For example, a more cautious investor might opt for investments with low\nvolatility.\nSimilar to standard deviation, the formula used to calculate variance also depends on whether the data is\ncollected from a sample or a population. The notation\nis used to represent the sample variance, and the\nnotation σ2 is used to represent the population variance.\nFormula for the sample variance:\nFormula for the population variance:\nThis is the method to calculate standard deviation and variance for a sample:\n1.\nFirst, find the mean\nof the data set by adding the data values and dividing the sum by the number of\ndata values.\n2.\nSet up a table with three columns, and in the first column, list the data values in the data set.\n3.\nFor each row, subtract the mean from the data value\n, and enter the difference in the second\n386\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncolumn.

So this third column will contain\nthe quantity (Data Value – Mean)2 for each row. We can write this quantity as\n.

A higher standard deviation indicates that the stock prices are more spread out from the mean, showing more volatility or variation in the stock prices. For example, if Stock B has a higher standard deviation than Stock A, it means that Stock B's prices fluctuate more widely around the mean price compared to Stock A, which has a lower standard deviation and thus less variation in its prices."

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.",

                    "answer": "The forecasted accounts payable for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is determined by adding up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income statement for the prior month. This method is based on the assumption that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. For instance, in the forecasted balance sheet, the accounts payable for March is calculated by taking the cost of goods sold in March from the forecasted income statement."

                    "answer": "The inventory balance for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is forecasted by considering the sales forecast by month and the company's inventory management strategy. During the first six months, the company aims to build inventory for four months of sales. As the busy season approaches, the inventory is reduced to three months' worth of future sales, and finally, it drops to only two months of sales in December. This approach allows managers to estimate the ending inventory balance each month based on their sales forecast, ensuring that the inventory levels are aligned with the company's sales cycle and operational needs."

Duration is an\nimportant measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as\nthe level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5",

                    "answer": "The duration of a bond is a measure of its interest rate risk, indicating how sensitive the bond's price is to changes in interest rates. A higher duration means the bond's price is more sensitive to interest rate changes. Duration is influenced by several factors: the bond's maturity, its coupon rate, and the current market interest rates. Specifically, the duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal. Additionally, the duration will increase with the bond's maturity and decrease with a higher coupon rate, assuming all other factors remain constant. This relationship highlights the importance of duration in assessing the interest rate risk associated with a bond investment."
