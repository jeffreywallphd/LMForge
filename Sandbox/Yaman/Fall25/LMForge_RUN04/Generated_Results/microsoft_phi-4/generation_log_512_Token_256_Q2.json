But \nthe point here is that since people do disagree in these areas, the ethical traits of thrift, temperance, and \nsexual abstinence do not have the unanimity of approval that the six core values do. \n \nThe importance of an individual’s having these consistent qualities of character is well known. Often we \nremember the last bad thing a person did far more than any or all previous good acts. For example, Eliot \nSpitzer and Bill Clinton are more readily remembered by people for their last, worst acts than for any good \nthey accomplished as public servants. As for a company, its good reputation also has an incalculable value \nthat when lost takes a great deal of time and work to recover. Shell, Nike, and other companies have \ndiscovered that there is a market for morality, however difficult to measure, and that not paying attention \nto business ethics often comes at a serious price. In the past fifteen years, the career of ethics and \ncompliance officer has emerged, partly as a result of criminal proceedings against companies but also \nbecause major companies have found that reputations cannot be recovered retroactively but must be \npursued proactively. For individuals, Aristotle emphasized the practice of virtue to the point where virtue \nbecomes a habit. Companies are gradually learning the same lesson. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThroughout history, people have pondered what it means “to do what is right.” Some of the main answers \nhave come from the differing perspectives of utilitarian thought; duty-based, or deontological, thought; social \ncontract theory; and virtue ethics. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nXYZ Motor Corporation begins to get customer complaints about two models of its automobiles.

Drivers could turn off the ignition and come to a safe stop, but XYZ does not instruct buyers of its cars to \ndo so, nor is this a common reaction among drivers who experience sudden acceleration. \nInternal investigations of half a dozen accidents in US locations come to the conclusion that the accidents are \nnot being caused by drivers who mistake the gas pedal for the brake pedal.

Understand one model for ethical decision making: a process to arrive at the most ethical option for an \nindividual or a business organization, using a virtue ethics approach combined with some elements of \nstakeholder analysis and utilitarianism. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Model \nOnce you recognize that there is a decision that involves ethical judgment, Michael Josephson would first \nhave you ask as many questions as are necessary to get a full background on the relevant facts. Then, \nassuming you have all the needed information, the decision process is as follows: \n1. Identify the stakeholders. That is, who are the potential gainers and losers in the various decisions \nthat might be made here? \n2. Identify several likely or reasonable decisions that could be made. \n3. Consider which stakeholders gain or lose with each decision. \n4. Determine which decision satisfies the greatest number of core values. \n5. If there is no decision that satisfies the greatest number of core values, try to determine which \ndecision delivers the greatest good to the various stakeholders. \n \nIt is often helpful to identify who (or what group) is the most important stakeholder, and why. In Milton \nFriedman’s view, it will always be the shareholders. In the view of John Mackey, the CEO of Whole Foods \nMarket, the long-term viability and profitability of the organization may require that customers come \nfirst, or, at times, some other stakeholder group (see “Conscious Capitalism” in Section 2.4 \"Corporations \nand Corporate Governance\"). \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n62 \nThe Core Values \nHere are the core values and their subcomponents as developed by the Josephson Institute of Ethics. \nTrustworthiness: Be honest—tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth; be \nsincere, forthright; don’t deceive, mislead, or be tricky with the truth; don’t cheat or steal, and \ndon’t betray a trust. Demonstrate integrity—stand up for what you believe, walk the walk as well \nas talking the talk; be what you seem to be; show commitment and courage. Be loyal—stand by \nyour family, friends, co-workers, community, and nation; be discreet with information that \ncomes into your hands; don’t spread rumors or engage in harmful gossip; don’t violate your \nprinciples just to win friendship or approval; don’t ask a friend to do something that is",

McClung, 379 US 294 (1964). \n \n \n \n4.3 Dormant Commerce Clause \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand that when Congress does not exercise its powers under the commerce clause, the Supreme \nCourt may still limit state legislation that discriminates against interstate commerce or places an undue \nburden on interstate commerce. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n154 \n2. Distinguish between “discrimination” dormant-commerce-clause cases and “undue burden” dormant-\ncommerce-clause cases. \n \n \nCongress has the power to legislate under the commerce clause and often does legislate. For example, \nCongress might say that trucks moving on interstate highways must not be more than seventy feet in \nlength. But if Congress does not exercise its powers and regulate in certain areas (such as the size and \nlength of trucks on interstate highways), states may make their own rules. States may do so under the so-\ncalled historic police powers of states that were never yielded up to the federal government. \nThese police powers can be broadly exercised by states for purposes of health, education, welfare, safety, \nmorals, and the environment. But the Supreme Court has reserved for itself the power to determine when \nstate action is excessive, even when Congress has not used the commerce clause to regulate. This power is \nclaimed to exist in the dormant commerce clause. \n \nThere are two ways that a state may violate the dormant commerce clause. If a state passes a law that is an \n“undue burden” on interstate commerce or that “discriminates” against interstate commerce, it will be \nstruck down. Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways, in Section 4.7 \"Summary and Exercises\", is an example \nof a case where Iowa imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce by prohibiting double trailers on \nits highways. [1] Iowa’s prohibition was judicially declared void when the Supreme Court judged it to be an \nundue burden. \n \nDiscrimination cases such as Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\") \npose a different standard.

An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent.

This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections.

Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform.

The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent? \n4. Why were workers’ compensation statutes adopted in the early twentieth century?",

There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights.

Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer.

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership.

Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to \nput capital into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without liability for the acts of the general \npartners. \n \nEven if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be important to understand the law that \ngoverns it. Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order.

And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

The latter has been adopted by thirty-five states. At common law, a partnership was not a legal entity \nand could not sue or be sued in the partnership name. Partnership law defines a partnership as “an \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.” The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) assumes that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals, but it also applies a \nnumber of rules characteristic of the legal entity theory. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \nassumes a partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule characteristic of the aggregate theory: \nthe partners are ultimately liable for the partnership’s obligations. Thus a partnership may keep business \nrecords as if it were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the partnership name, and may sue and be sued \nin federal court and in many state courts in the partnership name. \n \nPartnerships may be created informally. Among the clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-\nownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3) right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to \nshare liabilities, and (5) manner in which the business is operated. A partnership may also be formed by \nimplication; it may be formed by estoppel when a third party reasonably relies on a representation that a \npartnership in fact exists. \nNo special rules govern the partnership agreement. As a practical matter, it should sufficiently spell out \nwho the partners are, under what name they will conduct their business, the nature and scope of the \nbusiness, capital contributions of each partner, how profits are to be divided, and similar pertinent \nprovisions. An oral agreement to form a partnership is valid unless the business cannot be performed \nwholly within one year from the time that the agreement is made. However, most partnerships have no \nfixed terms and hence are “at-will” partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n488",

However, as to other grants or limitations of authority, “only a third party who knows or \nhas received a notification of a partner’s lack of authority in an ordinary course transaction is bound.” [4] \n \nSince RUPA is mostly intended to provide the rules for the small, unsophisticated partnership, it is \nquestionable whether these arcane “statements” are very often employed. \n \nPersonal Liability of Partners, in General \nIt is clear that the partnership is liable for contracts by authorized partners, as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs. The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner. Thus under RUPA the partners \nare guarantors of the partnership’s liabilities. [6] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n508 \nUnder UPA, contract liability is joint only, not also several. This means the partners must be sued in a \njoint action brought against them all. A partner who is not named cannot later be sued by a creditor in a \nseparate proceeding, though the ones who were named could see a proportionate contribution from the \nones who were not. \n \nLiability of Incoming Partners \nUnder RUPA Section 306(b), a new partner has no personal liability to existing creditors of the \npartnership, and only her capital investment in the firm is at risk for the satisfaction of existing \npartnership debts. Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new",

[22] A dissociated partner \ncan sue the firm to determine the buyout price and the court may assess attorney’s, appraiser’s, and \nexpert’s fees against a party the court finds “acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or in bad faith.”[23] \n \nWinding Up the Partnership under UPA and RUPA \nIf the partners decide not to continue the business upon dissolution, they are obliged to wind up the \nbusiness. The partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business, \nafter which it is terminated. [24]Winding up entails concluding all unfinished business pending at the \ndate of dissolution and payment of all debts. The partners must then settle accounts among themselves in \norder to distribute the remaining assets. At any time after dissolution and before winding up is completed, \nthe partners (except a wrongfully dissociated one) can stop the process and carry on the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n521 \n \nUPA and RUPA are not significantly different as to winding up, so they will be discussed together.

If Topel’s business had been a corporation, he would not have had insulation from liability for \npostdissolution contracts—he would have been liable. Is the result here equitable? Is it fraud? \n3. Seven months after the LLC’s existence was terminated by the state, the defendant hired a number of \nemployees, did not pay them, and then avoided liability under the LLC shield. How else could the court have \nruled here? It is possible that the legislature’s intent was simply to eliminate compulsory piercing \n(see Chapter 14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\" under corporate law principles and \nleave the question of LLC piercing to the courts. If so was the court’s decision was correct? The current LLC \nact language is similar to the Model Business Corporation Act, which surely permits piercing (see Chapter \n14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \n \nDefective Registration as a Limited Liability Partnership \nCampbell v.

(And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million.

The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors \nfailed to meet that burden could the trial court then address the directors’ Section 102(b)(7) exculpation \ndefense, including the statutory exception for acts not in good faith.",

We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC.",

They fell into disuse after the collapse of the Roman Empire and \nthen reappeared in Italy around the fourteenth century. They became more common as long-distance \ncommerce spread. In an era before paper currency, payment in coins or bullion was awkward, especially \nfor merchants who traveled great distances across national boundaries to attend the fairs at which most \neconomic exchanges took place. Merchants and traders found it far more efficient to pay with paper. \n \nBills of exchange, today commonly known as drafts, were recognized instruments in the law merchant. \n(The “law merchant” was the system of rules and customs recognized and adopted by early-modern \ntraders and is the basis of the UCC Article 3.) A draft is an unconditional order by one person (the drawer) \ndirecting another person (drawee or payor) to pay money to a named third person or to bearer; a check is \nthe most familiar type of draft. The international merchant courts regularly enforced drafts and permitted \nthem to be transferred to others by indorsement (the legal spelling of endorsement).

Article 3 is a set of general provisions \non negotiability; the other articles deal more narrowly with specific transactions or instruments. \n \nTypes of Commercial Paper \nThere are four types of commercial paper: drafts, checks, notes, and certificates of deposit. \n \n \nDrafts \nA draft is an unconditional written order by one person (the drawer) directing another person (the \ndrawee) to pay a certain sum of money on demand or at a definite time to a named third person (the \npayee) or to bearer. The draft is one of the two basic types of commercial paper; the other is the note. As \nindicated by its definition, the draft is a three-party transaction. \n \nParties to a Draft \nThe drawer is one who directs a person or an entity, usually a bank, to pay a sum of money stated in an \ninstrument—for example, a person who makes a draft or writes a check. The drawer prepares a document \n(a form, usually)—the draft—ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee.

The most common drawee is a bank. The drawer, drawee, and payee need not be different people; the \nsame person may have different capacities in a single transaction. For example, a drawer (the person \nasking that payment be made) may also be the payee (the person to whom the payment is to be made). A \ndrawee who signs the draft becomes an acceptor: the drawee pledges to honor the draft as written.

In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Martin \nwent to PNC’s main office in Louisville the next morning and met with representative Craig Friedman. \nAccording to Martin, Friedman advised that the check Martin deposited had cleared. Martin instructed \nFriedman to wire $130,600 to the Tokyo account. \n \nMartin returned to PNC later the same day. According to Martin, Friedman accessed Martin’s account \ninformation and said, “I don’t understand this. The check was cleared yesterday. Let me go find out what \nis going on.” Friedman returned with PNC vice president and branch manager Sherry Jennewein, who \ninformed Martin that the check was fraudulent. According to Martin, Jennewein told him that she wished \nhe had met with her instead of Friedman because she never would have authorized the wire transfer. \n \nFirst Century Bank, on which the check was drawn, dishonored the check. PNC charged Martin’s account \nfor $290,986.15. PNC, however, could not recover the $130,600 the bank had wired to the Tokyo account. \nMartin’s account, as a result, was left overdrawn by $124,313.01. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n927 \n \nPNC commenced this action. PNC asserts one count for Martin’s alleged breach of the transfer warranties \nprovided in Kentucky’s version of the Uniform Commercial Code and one count for breach of Martin’s \naccount agreement. PNC moves for summary judgment on both counts. \n \nII. Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability.",

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) finds that as of\nMay 2020, the median income for finance-related positions was $72,250 versus the overall median income of\nonly $41,950. Further, the BLS predicts that close to an additional 500,000 new finance- and accounting-related\njobs will be created by 2029.4 These new employment opportunities are in addition to the many openings that\nwill become available as baby boomers continue to retire and leave the workforce.\nSeveral of the BLS-listed finance careers do not even have finance or associated wording in the career titles.\nThe BLS identifies finance skills as necessary for careers such as management analysts and market research\nanalysts and work in logistics. Of course, many careers traditionally encourage the study of finance. These\ninclude job titles and descriptions such as these:\n•",

Bacon Signs established banking\nrelationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line.

It first appeared on May 26, 1896, as\na quick way for stock traders to assess if the stock market had gone “up or down” each day and by how\nmuch. Here we are over 100 years later, and the Dow 30 index is alive and well. Of course, the 30 companies\nhave changed, but the index does represent a continuous yardstick to measure stock performance over\ntime. As Table 1.1 shows, it took from 1906 to 1972, or a little over 66 years, for the Dow 30 to increase\ntenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a\nlittle under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. Time will tell if or when the Dow 30 will top 100,000 at the closing\nbell.\nClosing Milestones\nDate\n41\n5/26/1896\n100\n1/12/1906\n1,000\n11/14/1972\n10,000\n3/29/1999\n20,000\n1/25/2017\n30,000\n11/24/2020\nTable 1.1 The Dow 30 Closing\nMilestones and Dates\nImpact of Time on Saving and Spending\nThe choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in\n28\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

Accountants\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think\nabout the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,\nwhile economic value is what you are willing to pay.\n30\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n1.1 What Is Finance?\nFinance is the study of the trade-off between risk and expected return.

In this next section we will explore the\nrequirements for what needs to be reported, when, and to whom.\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n155\n5.8\nReporting Financial Activity\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the most common types of accounting periods.\n•\nOutline key considerations and accounting principles that dictate the timing of financial reporting.\n•\nDescribe the SEC reporting requirements relevant to financial statements.\n•\nIdentify the key elements of a company annual report.\nDefining Accounting Periods\nAn accounting period can be any period of time, but the most common accounting periods are months,\nquarters, and a year. Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

                    "answer": "The most common types of accounting periods are months, quarters, and a year. These periods are crucial in accrual accounting because they establish clear cutoffs for recording transactions. This ensures that financial activities are recorded in the appropriate period, providing a more accurate and timely representation of a company's financial health. By adhering to these periods, companies can better manage their finances, make informed decisions, and meet regulatory requirements."

                    "answer": "The time period principle is a key concept in accounting that states financial information must be provided in a timely manner to be useful. This principle is important because it ensures that financial statement users, both internal and external, receive the information they need quickly enough to make relevant decisions. Timely financial statements allow users to assess a company's financial health, make investment decisions, and plan for the future. Without the time period principle, financial information could become outdated, leading to poor decision-making and potential financial losses."

In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.",

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

We will\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

These bonds are rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher. Many commercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment grade. This restriction is due to the lower risk associated with these bonds, which are deemed to have a lower likelihood of default compared to lower-rated bonds."

We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697.

For this example, it was\ndecided to create a frequency distribution table with seven rows and a class width set to 300. The class\nwidth is the distance from the start of one interval to the start of the next interval in the subsequent row.\nFor example, the interval for the second row starts at 300, the interval for the third row starts at 600, and so\non.\nIn the second column, record the frequency, or the number of data values that fall within the interval, for\neach row. For example, for the first row, count the number of data values that fall between 0 and 299.\nBecause there is only one data value (278) that falls in this interval, the corresponding frequency is 1. For\nthe second row, there are 3 data values that fall between 300 and 599 (318, 422, and 577). Thus, the\nfrequency for the second row is 3.\nFor the third column, called relative frequency, take the frequency for each row and divide it by the sum of\nthe frequencies, which is 20.

If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders).

This approach is based on historical data, which shows that unearned revenue is typically around 50% of the current month's sales. By applying this percentage to the forecasted net sales, Clear Lake can accurately estimate the unearned revenue balance for each month."

Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted\ninto cash. Those ratios are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a\ngreater level of liquidity.\nThe formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:\nNotice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current\nliabilities.

This position reflects a level of liquidity and financial stability, as the company has more than enough resources to pay off its short-term debts and obligations.
