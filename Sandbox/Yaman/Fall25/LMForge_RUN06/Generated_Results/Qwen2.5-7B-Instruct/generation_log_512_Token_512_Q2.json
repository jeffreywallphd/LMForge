This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications.

For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1.

If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws.

As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber.",

This indicates that there is a need to find a balance where the employer's needs for a secure and productive work environment are considered alongside the employee's right to privacy. The court also draws an analogy to fundamental rights, suggesting that privacy is a crucial aspect of personal freedom, akin to other basic rights protected in the Constitution."

                    "answer": "In the U.S. Congress, representation is divided between the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives consists of representatives elected every two years from various districts within each state, with the number of districts determined by population through the decennial census. Every state has at least one representative, but larger states like California can have up to fifty-two representatives. On the other hand, the Senate comprises two senators per state, regardless of population, ensuring that smaller states maintain equal representation with larger ones. This structure effectively means that approximately 20% of the nation's population can send 50 senators to Congress, which some view as anti-democratic due to the disproportionate influence of smaller states. The House of Representatives, however, maintains a direct proportionality to population, with no state having fewer than one representative."

States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature.

This principle is fundamental to common-law systems because it ensures consistency and predictability in the application of laws. By adhering to precedents, judges can avoid re-examining settled issues, which helps maintain stability in the legal system. However, the principle also allows for flexibility; if circumstances change, judges may depart from past decisions, leading to evolution in the law over time.

On a principle level, the imposition of taxes and the expenditure of tax proceeds are governmental functions, which have established controls to ensure they align with public preferences.

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Law and Legal \nSystems\". The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal \ndistrict court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift \nSystems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris.

This includes practices that are generally accepted as appropriate or necessary for maintaining trust and integrity within an organization. Companies that adhere to these customs, even when they are not mandated by law, can build a stronger reputation and maintain stakeholder confidence.

                    "answer": "According to the text, a company might justify not complying with laws that are not strictly enforced by arguing that they are still operating within the 'rules of the game.' However, this reasoning raises significant ethical concerns. While the company might avoid immediate penalties, it risks damaging its reputation and contributing to broader societal harm. For instance, discharging pollutants into a river, even if not legally enforced, can have severe environmental consequences affecting both local ecosystems and human health. Moreover, if other companies in the industry engage in similar practices, the collective impact could be substantial and detrimental. Thus, while the company may be technically 'within the rules,' its actions could be seen as ethically questionable, as they undermine the principle of responsible stewardship and the well-being of communities and the environment."

At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\").

Firstly, state courts are required to honor federal law, particularly in cases where state laws conflict with federal ones, as mandated by the supremacy clause of the Constitution. This means that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws. Secondly, state courts may try claims arising under federal statutes, provided the Constitution or Congress does not explicitly mandate that only federal courts can handle such cases. Additionally, the full faith and credit clause obligates state courts to recognize and enforce the judgments of other states' courts, ensuring consistency across judicial decisions. Furthermore, state courts often need to consider the laws of other states when dealing with cases that involve legal issues spanning multiple jurisdictions, such as interstate accidents. In these situations, state judges might apply the laws of another state to resolve the dispute, reflecting the interplay between state and federal legal frameworks."

For instance, if a case involves a federal statute, it can typically be heard in either a state court or a federal court, depending on the specifics of the case and any relevant federal rules. However, state courts are bound to follow federal law where it conflicts with state law, as dictated by the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. Conversely, federal courts must also respect the principles of state law when necessary, especially in matters that touch upon state-specific regulations or constitutional provisions. Moreover, state courts must recognize and enforce the judgments of other states' courts, adhering to the full faith and credit clause. This interaction ensures that both state and federal interests are considered, allowing for a harmonious resolution of disputes that span multiple legal jurisdictions."

Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states.

This practice is justified by the idea that litigants should not be required to litigate all relevant claims in separate lawsuits, and it helps to avoid piecemeal litigation.

                    "answer": "The Robinsons must consider several factors when deciding whether to file their products-liability claim in a state or federal court in Oklahoma. Firstly, they need to ensure that the court has subject matter jurisdiction, meaning it has the authority to hear cases involving products liability claims. Additionally, they must determine if the claim involves a significant amount of money, as this will dictate whether they can file in small claims court or a court with limited jurisdiction. They also need to check if the case can be heard in federal court, which requires either a federal question or diversity jurisdiction. If they wish to pursue federal court, they must ensure that the claim is not based on a federal question and that there is sufficient diversity of citizenship among the parties. Another issue is that if the Robinsons are not established as Arizona residents, they cannot use diversity jurisdiction to file in federal court in Oklahoma. These considerations highlight the complexity of choosing the appropriate court and the potential legal hurdles they may face."

Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail.

These documents often include a counterclaim from the defendant against the plaintiff, making the defendant effectively the new plaintiff for those claims. The plaintiff can then file a reply to the defendant's counterclaim. During the early phases of a lawsuit, parties typically make various motions to the judge. These motions often aim to dismiss the lawsuit, transfer it to another venue, or compel the opposing party to act in specific ways during the discovery process. For example, a motion to dismiss might be used to argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter or that there is no cause of action. A motion for change of venue could be sought if it is believed that the current location is not fair or impartial. Additionally, motions for discovery compel the opposing party to provide information or evidence relevant to the case, such as documents, testimony, or physical evidence."

These admissions can be used by Johnson & Johnson to argue that both Mr. Ferlito and Mrs. Ferlito contributed to the incident, thereby shifting some or all responsibility away from the company. If the court finds that either or both plaintiffs' actions were negligent and contributed to their injuries, the case can be dismissed before trial on the grounds of contributory negligence, as their negligence would bar them from recovering damages in a contributory negligence jurisdiction."

A trial judge in Nevada is wondering whether to enforce a surrogate motherhood contract. Penelope \nBarr, of Reno, Nevada, has contracted with Reuben and Tina Goldberg to bear the in vitro fertilized egg \nof Mrs. Goldberg. After carrying the child for nine months, Penelope gives birth, but she is reluctant to \ngive up the child, even though she was paid $20,000 at the start of the contract and will earn an \nadditional $20,000 on handing over the baby to the Goldbergs. (Barr was an especially good candidate \nfor surrogate motherhood: she had borne two perfect children and at age 28 drinks no wine, does not \nsmoke or use drugs of any kind, practices yoga, and maintains a largely vegetarian diet with just \nenough meat to meet the needs of the fetus within.) \nThe Goldbergs have asked the judge for an order compelling Penelope to give up the baby, who was \nfive days old when the lawsuit was filed. The baby is now a month old as the judge looks in vain for \nguidance from any Nevada statute, federal statute, or any prior case in Nevada that addressed the \nissue of surrogate motherhood. He does find several well-reasoned cases, one from New Jersey, one \nfrom Michigan, and one from Oregon. Are any of these “precedent” that he must follow? May he \nadopt the reasoning of any of these courts, if he should find that reasoning persuasive? \n \n \n \n \n3.6 When Can Someone Bring a Lawsuit? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Mrs. Robinson's attorney would likely argue that the judge's decision to disqualify her key witness without allowing the jury to hear his testimony was a violation of her right to present a complete defense. The attorney could claim that the judge's examination of the witness in the jury room and subsequent disqualification was an improper exercise of judicial discretion and prejudiced her case. Additionally, the attorney may contend that the judge's actions deprived her of the opportunity to cross-examine the witness and challenge his qualifications, which are fundamental rights guaranteed by the rules of civil procedure. Furthermore, the attorney might argue that the disqualification was arbitrary and capricious, and that the judge failed to provide a clear rationale for his decision, thereby violating due process."

Factors that might influence his decision include the quality of the reasoning in those cases, the relevance of the issues addressed, and the potential for harmonizing with existing Nevada law or public policy. The judge may also consider the unique circumstances of the Penelope Barr case, such as her excellent health and lifestyle, the age of the child, and the financial arrangements made in the contract.

Even though Mrs. Robinson did not see the arbitration clause, the enforceability of the clause typically depends on whether the contract as a whole was fairly entered into and whether Mrs. Robinson had notice of the clause's existence. Since she did not see the clause, she might have a weaker argument that it was unconscionable or unfair to include without her knowledge, but the specific terms of the contract and applicable law would need to be considered. Given the clause explicitly states arbitration in New York, a court in Oklahoma would likely enforce the arbitration requirement rather than allowing a lawsuit to proceed."

For arbitration or mediation to take place, there must be a prior agreement to submit to these methods for resolving disputes. Without such an agreement, Koster would need to file a lawsuit in a court of competent jurisdiction to seek payment of the $66,000 owed to him by Automark. The lack of a prior agreement to arbitrate means that Koster cannot unilaterally impose arbitration on Automark, and Automark would have no obligation to participate in arbitration proceedings initiated by Koster without a prior agreement."

This reflected an originalist perspective that the Constitution should primarily be interpreted according to the Founders' original intentions.

                    "answer": "If the Supreme Court were to revert to a strict interpretation of the commerce clause similar to that in Hammer v. Dagenhart, it could potentially render numerous federal programs unconstitutional. For instance, Obamacare, which includes provisions related to health insurance mandates and Medicaid expansion, would likely lack a sufficient basis in the commerce clause since these programs do not involve direct interstate commerce. Similarly, Medicare, which provides healthcare services to senior citizens, might also face challenges as it primarily serves a local population rather than engaging in interstate transactions. Homeland security, while involving some interstate activities, may still be vulnerable given the focus on local threats. Social Security, which provides retirement benefits, would similarly struggle to meet the criteria for interstate commerce. These programs rely on the broad interpretation of the commerce clause that allows federal intervention in areas affecting the economy as a whole. A return to a more narrow interpretation would significantly curtail federal legislative authority in these and other areas, potentially leading to a shift in power towards state governments and limiting the scope of federal programs designed to address national issues."

The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated.

Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v.

Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954).

Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980).

Furthermore, the court highlighted that the exemptions in the statute, such as those for border cities and livestock shipments, indicated that the law primarily benefited Iowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. These factors weakened the presumption of validity for the state safety regulation, leading to the conclusion that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened interstate commerce."

The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes.

Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis.

                    "answer": "US courts require that someone seeking judicial review of an agency order first exhaust administrative remedies because this requirement ensures that the administrative process is given a fair opportunity to resolve the dispute. It also respects the expertise and specialized knowledge of the administrative agencies in their respective fields. By requiring exhaustion, courts can ensure that all possible avenues for resolution have been explored before a court becomes involved, which helps to conserve judicial resources and promotes efficient administration of justice. Additionally, this requirement allows for the possibility that the administrative body may correct any procedural or substantive errors that may have occurred during its decision-making process, thereby providing a more thorough and fair resolution of the matter."

United States, 346 US 15 (1953), which involved a claim for damages resulting from the release of toxic chemicals during the manufacture of ammonium nitrate. In this case, the government did argue sovereign immunity, but the Supreme Court held that the FTCA provided a waiver of immunity for certain tort claims against the federal government. The Court reasoned that the Act was designed to promote fairness and to compensate victims of federal negligence, and thus, the government's argument of sovereign immunity was not upheld in this instance. However, the concept of sovereign immunity still exists and is a complex legal doctrine that can sometimes shield the government from liability, depending on the specific circumstances and the nature of the claim."

The text highlights that while the Walsh-Healey Act ensures certain labor standards for government contractors, it does not logically extend to imply that all businesses in interstate commerce are subject to similar levels of regulation.

The text argues that allowing government inspectors to enter these areas without a warrant would be unjustified, as it would effectively override the owner's privacy rights.

                    "answer": "The court differentiates between closely regulated industries and others because these industries often face more stringent oversight and regulation due to inherent risks or the nature of their operations. For instance, industries like manufacturing, mining, and construction pose unique hazards that necessitate specific health and safety standards. The court likely believes that the balance between privacy and safety needs to be carefully considered in these contexts. By distinguishing between closely regulated industries, the court acknowledges the need for more rigorous enforcement of workplace safety standards while also respecting the Fourth Amendment's protections. This distinction allows the court to uphold the Act's requirements while ensuring that searches are justified and not arbitrary, thereby maintaining a fair balance between regulatory enforcement and individual rights."

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree).

This definition encompasses a wide range of actions that historically might not have been considered larceny. For instance, in the past, picking a peach directly from a tree was not seen as larceny since the peach was part of the land and not detached personal property. However, under current laws, if someone picks up a peach that has fallen to the ground, they are guilty of larceny. Similarly, the act of taking electricity by connecting to another's power lines, which was unclear in the late 19th century, is now recognized as a form of larceny due to modern statutes. Intent also plays a crucial role; borrowing a friend's car for a short time without permission but returning it shortly afterward does not constitute larceny, whereas agreeing to a long joyride and returning much later might. This shows how modern laws have expanded the scope of what constitutes larceny to cover more specific and nuanced situations than the original common law definition."

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

Thus Hermione could sue Draco for battery for any damages \nshe had suffered. \n \nFalse Imprisonment \nThe tort of false imprisonment originally implied a locking up, as in a prison, but today it can occur if a \nperson is restrained in a room or a car or even if his or her movements are restricted while walking down \nthe street. People have a right to be free to go as they please, and anyone who without cause deprives \nanother of personal freedom has committed a tort. Damages are allowed for time lost, discomfort and \nresulting ill health, mental suffering, humiliation, loss of reputation or business, and expenses such as \nattorneys’ fees incurred as a result of the restraint (such as a false arrest).

For a case to go to the jury, the \ncourts required that the mental distress result from some physical injury. In recent years, many courts \nhave overthrown the older rule and now recognize the so-called new tort. In an employment context, \nhowever, it is rare to find a case where a plaintiff is able to recover. The most difficult hurdle is proving \nthat the conduct was “extreme” or “outrageous.” \n \nIn an early California case, bill collectors came to the debtor’s home repeatedly and threatened the \ndebtor’s pregnant wife. Among other things, they claimed that the wife would have to deliver her child in \nprison. The wife miscarried and had emotional and physical complications. The court found that the \nbehavior of the collection company’s two agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of \nintentional infliction of emotional distress. In Roche v.

The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose.

Factual \nissues are for the jury to resolve.

It serves as a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference of negligence. Essentially, if the incident is one that usually does not happen unless someone is careless, the plaintiff does not need to prove exactly how the defendant was negligent. For example, if a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or if a soda bottle explodes, or if an airplane crashes, the plaintiff can rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to infer negligence, as these incidents are not typical occurrences and thus suggest improper care. Courts in all states recognize this principle, allowing juries to conclude that negligence likely occurred in the absence of a defendant's contrary explanation."

For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages. \n \nAssumption of Risk \nRisk of injury pervades the modern world, and plaintiffs should not win a lawsuit simply because they \ntook a risk and lost. The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity. If the \nplaintiff had no actual knowledge of the risk, he cannot be held to have assumed it. On the other hand, it is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n304 \neasy to claim that you did not appreciate the danger, and the courts will apply an objective standard of \ncommunity knowledge (a “but you should have known” test) in many situations. When the plaintiff has no \nreal alternative, however, assumption of risk fails as a defense (e.g., a landlord who negligently fails to \nlight the exit to the street cannot claim that his tenants assumed the risk of using it). \n \nAt the turn of the century, courts applied assumption of risk in industrial cases to bar relief to workers \ninjured on the job. They were said to assume the risk of dangerous conditions or equipment. This rule has \nbeen abolished by workers’ compensation statutes in most states. \n \nAct of God \nTechnically, the rule that no one is responsible for an “act of God,” or force majeure as it is sometimes",

                    "answer": "The principle behind the rule of comparative negligence is that damages are apportioned according to the defendant's degree of culpability. In practice, this means that if a plaintiff sustains a $100,000 injury and is found to be 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages.

                    "question": "How does the assumption of risk doctrine function in different scenarios, and what factors influence its application in court?",
                    "answer": "The assumption of risk doctrine operates in several ways. It can occur through formal agreements, where the plaintiff explicitly agrees to waive liability, such as borrowing a car with a clause about non-liability for mechanical failures. Alternatively, it applies when the plaintiff enters a situation knowing inherent risks, like a fan being hit by a baseball at a stadium. Lastly, it can be invoked when the plaintiff faces risks created by the defendant's negligence, such as entering a vehicle driven by a drunk driver. Courts often apply an objective standard of community knowledge to determine whether the plaintiff appreciated the danger, but they also consider subjective factors. The defense of assumption of risk is less effective when the plaintiff has no real alternative, such as a tenant using a poorly lit exit in a building with no other safe route. Additionally, the historical application of this doctrine in industrial cases to bar workers' relief has been largely superseded by workers' compensation statutes in most states."

The rocket exploded near a crowd of onlookers, including Danny Klein. Klein’s clothing was \nset on fire, and he suffered facial burns and serious injury to his eyes. Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages. The public display of fireworks fits this \ndefinition. The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created. That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be \nmisdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence.

The rationale behind this is to ensure that those who engage in such activities are fully responsible for the risks associated with their actions. In the case of fireworks displays, the potential for rockets to malfunction or be misdirected creates a substantial danger to large crowds of people, making it an abnormally dangerous activity.

Although the negligent manufacture of the fireworks by the Chinese manufacturer could be a contributing factor to the incident, strict liability applies to the party that carries out the abnormally dangerous activity, which in this case is Pyrodyne. The court's decision in this case explicitly states that even if negligence can be considered an intervening cause, it does not absolve Pyrodyne from strict liability. This means that Klein can pursue damages from Pyrodyne, and the fact that the fireworks were negligently manufactured does not preclude him from seeking compensation from the party directly responsible for the display. Therefore, Klein has the right to seek recovery from both the Chinese manufacturer and Pyrodyne, ensuring that he is adequately compensated for his injuries."

In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations",

                    "answer": "The key difference between the creation of contract duties and tort duties lies in the process of formation. Contract duties arise through a mutual agreement between parties who engage in a bargaining process, where they have the freedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. This process involves control over the terms and conditions agreed upon, reflecting the principle of individual autonomy. On the other hand, tort duties are obligations imposed by the law itself, regardless of the parties' intentions or agreements. These duties do not require mutual consent or a bargaining process; instead, they are based on the legal standards and norms that protect individuals against harm caused by others. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for businesses, as it influences their strategic planning and risk management strategies."

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

Still, although there are \nnumerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out \ntheir contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright.

The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854.

The Hadley v. Baxendale case, a landmark decision from 1854, exemplifies this principle. In this case, Joseph and Jonah Hadley, proprietors of a flour mill, sought compensation for the delay in receiving a replacement shaft for their milling engine, which caused them significant financial loss. The court ruled that the carrier, Pickford and Company, was not liable for the consequential damages because Baxendale could not have reasonably foreseen the specific loss of business and income resulting from the delay. This case underscores the importance of proving that the breaching party had a reasonable foresight of such losses at the time the contract was formed, thereby limiting the scope of compensable damages to those that were foreseeable and directly related to the breach."

                    "answer": "The court affirmed the judgment because it was clearly stated in the record that Tilford Reppert is the only claimant who is both qualified and eligible to receive the reward. The text indicates that he was involved in an act or service that led to the arrest of a fugitive, which made him eligible for the reward as per the legal precedent mentioned. Furthermore, the case established that a public officer with the authority to make an arrest can accept an offer of reward for acts or services performed outside of their official duties, provided they are not within the scope of their regular job responsibilities. This legal principle supported the decision to award the reward to Tilford Reppert."

                    "answer": "In the EBWS, LLC v. Britly Corp. case, the Ransoms, owners of Rock Bottom Farm, decided to build a creamery on-site to process their milk and form EBWS, LLC to manage it. In 2001, they contracted with Britly to construct the creamery for $160,318. The creamery was almost complete by April 15, 2001, but upon moving in, EBWS discovered defects in the construction. On June 5, 2001, EBWS formally notified Britly about these issues. Despite the defects, EBWS continued using the creamery until it needed to vacate it for three weeks to undergo repairs. In September 2001, EBWS filed a lawsuit against Britly, alleging breach of contract and express warranty due to the defective design and construction. After a three-day trial, the jury ruled in favor of EBWS, finding Britly liable for the breach and awarding them $38,020 in direct damages and $35,711 in consequential damages. Consequential damages included the costs incurred during the closure period for repairs. This case highlights the legal implications of construction defects and the financial consequences for the parties involved in such agreements."

Article 2 governs the sale of \ngoods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. When the goods \nare “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies. For two categories \nof goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood \nsupplied for transfusions is not. \n \nTypes of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-\ncontracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) \ncompleted (executed) and uncompleted (executory). To understand contract law, it is necessary to master \nthese distinctions and their nuances. \n \nIn order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be",

                    "answer": "According to the context provided, EBWS's CEO might believe that purchasing milk from Rock Bottom Farm is a necessary step to maintain operations and avoid economic losses, despite the fact that EBWS cannot process the milk immediately. This action ensures that EBWS does not lose potential revenue from the sale of milk, which could occur if the farm were to stop milking cows due to the unavailability of a processing plant. Additionally, it might be a strategic decision to build a relationship with local farmers, potentially securing a consistent supply of milk once the creamery resumes operations."

                    "answer": "EBWS may not have been entitled to damages for certain costs associated with the temporary closure of the creamery because the nature and extent of such damages are uncertain and speculative. The text indicates that the profits from the closure are uncertain and not recoverable. Therefore, the damages that EBWS would incur, such as the cost of milk that cannot be processed and the wages of employees who would be idled during the repair period, are subject to significant uncertainty. Courts typically require that damages be foreseeable and certain at the time of the contract to be recoverable, and in this case, the exact amount of these future costs could not be accurately predicted."

Now, while you have income from doing clients’ taxes, I have an excellent offer for \nyou. You can buy a new Buick Century automobile completely loaded for $36,000. Al, I know you’re busy. If \nI don’t hear from you by the end of the day, I’ll assume you want the car.” Albert, distracted, did not \nrespond immediately, and the dealer hung up.

In this scenario, although Joe made an offer and Kate initially accepted it, she later rejected the offer before Joe received her acceptance letter. Since the acceptance was not communicated to Joe in a manner that would be effective under the circumstances, the acceptance cannot be considered valid.

In this case, the dealer made an offer to sell a car to Albert for $36,000, but Albert did not respond to the offer within the specified timeframe. The dealer's call was essentially an invitation to treat rather than a firm offer, as it included conditions that Albert had to act within a limited time frame. Albert's failure to respond promptly, despite being distracted, means he did not accept the offer. Additionally, the dealer's subsequent actions, such as sending a statement and instructions to pick up the car, were not a binding acceptance of the offer but rather an attempt to pressure Albert into accepting the deal.

Generally, the rule of infancy allows minors to disaffirm contracts entered into while they were still minors. However, the specific circumstances of this case do not fall under the exception for insurance policies. Minors can disaffirm contracts for non-essential goods and services, but insurance policies are considered essential for protection against financial loss. Thus, the rejection of uninsured motorist coverage is not subject to disaffirmance based on infancy. Any attempt to disaffirm the rejection would likely fail, and he would be bound by the terms of the insurance policy he declined to accept."

Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady.

It also defines the scope of authority an agent has and the limitations on their actions. Additionally, it outlines the consequences of unauthorized actions by an agent and the remedies available to the principal if the agent acts outside their authority.

            "chunk": "Figure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

This arrangement ensures that the agent's rights in a particular transaction cannot be terminated without their consent, thereby protecting their interests. For instance, a literary agent who sells a work on behalf of an author and receives a percentage of the earnings continues to have the authority to collect those earnings, thus safeguarding their right to receive the agreed-upon commission. This type of arrangement prevents the principal from unilaterally terminating the agent's rights, ensuring that the agent's financial stake in the business remains secure."

But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v.

How agency relationships are terminated \n \n \nIn Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\" we considered the relationships between \nagent and principal. Now we turn to relationships between third parties and the principal or agent. \nWhen the agent makes a contract for his principal or commits a tort in the course of his work, is the \nprincipal liable? What is the responsibility of the agent for torts committed and contracts entered \ninto on behalf of his principal? How may the relationship be terminated so that the principal or agent \nwill no longer have responsibility toward or liability for the acts of the other? These are the questions \naddressed in this chapter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.1 Principal’s Contract Liability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority",

Express authority is explicitly granted by the principal to the agent, such as signing a power of attorney. Implied authority arises from the actions and conduct of the principal and agent, where the principal has implicitly given permission for the agent to act within a certain scope. Apparent authority occurs when a third party reasonably believes that the agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal, even if the principal did not actually grant such authority.

What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel. Estoppel is the doctrine \nthat a person will not now be allowed to deny a promise or assertion she previously made where there has \nbeen detrimental reliance on that promise or assertion.

                    "answer": "In the United States, for a corporate officer's delegation of authority to be considered valid, it must be proven that the power of the traveling executive is shown. This means that there needs to be clear evidence that the officer has been granted the authority to act on behalf of the corporation. Additionally, the right of the corporate officer to delegate this authority back to someone else within the company or to a third party must also be demonstrated."

                    "answer": "Apparent authority operates in an agency relationship when a third party reasonably believes that an agent has the authority to act on behalf of the principal due to the principal's words or conduct. Even if the agent does not have actual authority, the principal can still be bound by the actions of the agent if the third party had a reasonable belief in the agent's authority. Estoppel comes into play here as a legal doctrine that prevents the principal from denying the agent's authority if the third party has detrimentally relied on it. Essentially, estoppel ensures that the principal cannot renege on a deal if the third party has acted in good faith based on the principal's representations."

[1] The plaintiff was run over on a highway \nby a speeding cart and horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply. If a hungry deliveryman stops at a restaurant outside the normal \nlunch hour, intending to continue to his next delivery after eating, he is within the scope of employment. \nBut suppose he decides to take the truck home that evening, in violation of rules, in order to get an early \nstart the next morning. Suppose he decides to stop by the beach, which is far away from his route. Does it \nmake a difference if the employer knows that his deliverymen do this? \n \nThe Zone of Risk Test \nCourt decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a different standard, one that looks to the",

The court held the employer liable because the cart and horse had never been driven in the vicinity where the plaintiff was walking and it had no business there, suggesting that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own purposes. According to the great English jurist Baron Parke, if the servants were on their master’s business and took a detour to call upon a friend, the master would be responsible.

This shift in focus acknowledges that the risk of an employee's actions may extend beyond just the immediate purpose of their work, potentially including areas where they might be reasonably expected to go due to their job responsibilities. For instance, if a deliveryman stops at a restaurant outside the normal lunch hour with the intention of continuing deliveries afterward, the action remains within the scope of employment since it aligns with his primary duty. However, if he decides to take the truck home in violation of rules or stops at a distant location like a beach, these actions could fall outside the scope of employment depending on how closely the court deems them related to his work duties."

It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. We consider each situation. \n \nAgent for Undisclosed or Partially Disclosed Principal \nAn agent need not, and frequently will not, inform the person with whom he is negotiating that he is \nacting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a",

Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nIn general, an agent is not personally liable on contracts he has signed on behalf of a principal. This \ngeneral rule has several exceptions recognized in most states: (1) when the agent is serving an undisclosed \nor partially disclosed principal, (2) when the agent lacks authority or exceeds his authority, and (3) if the \nagent entered into the contract in a personal capacity.",

In the case of Lynch at First Bank, the last paragraph of the guaranty stating 'This guaranty is signed by an officer having legal right to bind the company through authorization of the Board of Directors' would likely be sufficient to establish the officer's authority. However, including such a statement explicitly would provide stronger evidence of the officer's authority, thereby reducing the risk of disputes over the validity of the guaranty. Similarly, if the president of the milk company, who is also a director, affirmatively stated that the manager had authority to sign the guaranty, this would further strengthen the validity of the guaranty, though it is still advisable to have the explicit authorization in writing for clarity and to avoid potential challenges to the officer's authority."

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership. There are also limited partnerships \nand limited liability partnerships, which are discussed in Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nTable 11.1 Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and Limited Liability \nCompanies \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nTotal number of active partnerships \n2,375,375 \n2,546,877 \n2,763,625 \n2,947,116 \nNumber of partners \n14,108,458 15,556,553 16,211,908 16,727,803 \nNumber of limited partnerships \n378,921 \n402,238 \n413,712 \n432,550 \nNumber of partners \n6,262,103 \n7,023,921 \n6,946,986 \n6,738,737 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n458 \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nNumber of limited liability companies 1,091,502 \n1,270,236 \n1,465,223 \n1,630,161 \nNumber of partners \n4,226,099 \n4,949,808",

                    "answer": "Partnership law defines a partnership as 'the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.' This definition is significant because it emphasizes that a partnership can exist even if the individuals involved do not explicitly intend to form one. This means that the nature of the relationship between the parties, their conduct, and the circumstances surrounding their business activities can lead to a partnership being formed, even without formal documentation or agreement. Understanding this definition helps in recognizing the importance of partnership in business organizations, especially in fields such as accounting, law, and medicine, where professionals often choose to work together under this legal framework."

                    "answer": "The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) was set out for states to adopt, while the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) was promulgated for state adoption. The UPA was developed in the 1990s, with specific versions adopted by various states over time, such as the 1992 or 1994 versions by Connecticut and West Virginia, and the 1997 version by other states. On the other hand, RUPA, which stands for Revised Uniform Partnership Act, was promulgated more recently and has been adopted by several states including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and others, making it the default position for partnerships in those jurisdictions. Both acts aim to provide a framework for partnership agreements but differ in some provisions, such as the definition of a partnership, the rules regarding partnership formation, and the rights and responsibilities of partners."

                    "answer": "The term 'default position' in relation to the partnership act means that if no specific agreement exists between the partners, the partnership will be governed by the provisions of the act, which serve as a fallback or default set of rules. This implies that unless partners explicitly create a partnership agreement that deviates from these default rules, their relationship will be governed by the partnership act. UPA or RUPA is likely to be of most importance for general partnerships and limited partnerships, especially when there is no written agreement or when the agreement is silent on certain issues. These acts provide a comprehensive framework for partnership operations, which can help prevent disputes and ensure clarity in the partnership structure, making them particularly relevant for these types of partnerships where clear guidelines are necessary."

And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and minor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement.

If a partnership fails to comply with the assumed or fictitious name statutes, it could face difficulties in enforcing its contracts. The name chosen should accurately reflect the nature of the business; for instance, a partnership should not be described as a corporation. Additionally, the name must not be misleading or deceptive, as it could violate existing business names. Failure to register the name in the required manner might also result in the inability to sue in court to enforce contracts, as demonstrated in cases like Loomis v. Whitehead."

Further, there are some specific limits on \nhow far the fiduciary duty reaches (which means parties are held to the lower standard of “good faith”). \nHere are two examples. First, RUPA—unlike UPA—does not extend to the formation of the partnership; \nComment 2 to RUPA Section 404 says that would be inappropriate because then the parties are “really \ndealing at arm’s length.” Second, fiduciary duty doesn’t apply to a dissociated partner (one who leaves the \nfirm—discussed in Section 12 \"Dissociation\") who can immediately begin competing without the others’ \nconsent; and it doesn’t apply if a partner violates the standard “merely because the partner’s conduct \nfurthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own.

Section 403(b) of RUPA provides, “A partnership shall provide partners \nand their agents and attorneys access to its books and records. It shall provide former partners and their \nagents and attorneys access to books and records pertaining to the period during which they were \npartners. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy books and records during \nordinary business hours. A partnership may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and \nmaterial, for copies of documents furnished.”[18] \n \nSection 19 of UPA is basically in accord. This means that without demand—and for any purpose—the \npartnership must provide any information concerning its business and affairs reasonably required for the \nproper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or the act; and on \ndemand, it must provide any other information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs, unless \nthe demand is unreasonable or improper.

This right allows partners to inspect and copy books and records during ordinary business hours, subject to a reasonable charge for copies. Similarly, Section 19 of UPA mandates that partnerships must provide information concerning their business and affairs for the proper exercise of a partner's rights and duties, unless the demand is unreasonable or improper. In general, the partnership agreement cannot deny the right to inspection.

Express authority is that explicitly delegated to the agent, implied authority is \nthat necessary to the carrying out of the express authority, and apparent authority is that which a third \nparty is led to believe has been conferred by the principal on the agent, even though in fact it was not or it \nwas revoked. When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others.

Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners.

Limited liability protects business owners from personal financial losses beyond their initial investments, encouraging them to take risks and invest without fear of losing more than they have invested. Limited taxation refers to the fact that these hybrid forms often pay federal income tax in their own name, which can reduce the overall tax burden compared to individual taxation of partners. These benefits are balanced against the risk of unlimited liability, which is mitigated by the limited liability aspect, and the potential for complex tax structures, which is addressed by the limited taxation feature. This combination aims to provide a flexible framework for businesses to manage their risks and taxes while offering the significant advantage of limited personal liability for the owners."

                    "answer": "Having a general partner be a corporation can achieve the goal of limited liability for everyone involved in the partnership. However, this arrangement is somewhat 'clunky' because it introduces additional layers of complexity. Corporations have their own legal structure and governance, which can complicate decision-making processes and create administrative burdens. Moreover, the corporate form adds another layer of paperwork and compliance requirements, making the overall management and operation of the limited partnership more cumbersome. This complexity can lead to inefficiencies and higher costs, which may outweigh the benefits of having a corporation as a general partner in some cases."

A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary.

Partners are not personally liable for such obligations, except in cases of their own negligence or wrongful acts they supervise.

Specifically, the general partner(s) in a limited partnership still faces unlimited personal liability, which can create significant risk. Additionally, the management and decision-making responsibilities are often concentrated in the hands of the general partner, which can lead to issues of moral hazard. Moral hazard refers to the potential for the general partner to act in ways that maximize their own interests at the expense of the limited partners or the business itself, given their reduced financial exposure.

Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection. They are also entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against \nunreasonable search and seizure; in other words, the police must have a search warrant to enter corporate \npremises and look through files.

[1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware?",

If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million.

This requirement ensures uniqueness and prevents confusion among consumers. On the business side, the chosen name should accurately reflect the nature of the business and have the potential to adapt to future changes. A name that fails to meet these criteria might necessitate a change, which can be costly. For instance, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey's rebranding to Exxon in 1972 resulted in an expenditure of over $100 million, and even then, some shareholders expressed dissatisfaction with the new name, deeming it reminiscent of a laxative.

The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency.

A state cannot change a charter unless it reserves the right when \ngranting the charter. \nIn selecting a state in which to incorporate, a corporation looks for a favorable corporate climate.

For example, if the incorporators of BCT Bookstore, Inc., fail to file the articles of incorporation but use the corporation's property, they cannot later claim that the corporation does not exist.

Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1.

There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy.

In contrast, bonds do not alter the ownership structure; instead, they represent a loan from the investor to the corporation, where the corporation agrees to repay the principal amount plus interest over time.

The economy in general could impact the decision: a \nbear market could push BCT more toward using debt, while a bull market could push BCT more toward an \ninitial public offering (discussed in Section 15.4.1 \"Sale of stock\") or stock sale.

If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable.

This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock.

The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation.

Specifically, the court stated that the requirement is not met when the consideration for the stock is work or services to be performed in the future, regardless of whether the stock is given for services already rendered or to be rendered.

Shareholders, who are the owners of the corporation, generally have limited decision-making authority, primarily through the election of directors and voting on specific matters like mergers or significant acquisitions. This division of power implies that while shareholders have ultimate ownership, their direct involvement in daily operations and strategic decisions is minimal, and their influence is largely exercised through the elected directors and officers."

The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth. Improper purposes include uncovering trade \nsecrets for sale to a competitor or compiling mailing lists for personal business purposes. A shareholder’s \nmotivation is an important factor in determining whether the purpose is proper, as the courts attempt to \nbalance the rights of both the shareholders and the corporation. For example, a Minnesota court applied \nDelaware law in finding that a shareholder’s request to view the corporation’s shareholder ledger to \nidentify shareholders and communicate with them about the corporation’s involvement in the Vietnam \nWar was improper. A desire to communicate with the other corporate shareholders was found to be \ninsufficient to compel inspection.

However, when requesting specific records such as minutes from board meetings or accounting records, shareholders must have a 'proper purpose,' such as evaluating the company's dividend policy or assessing its financial status. Improper purposes might involve actions like obtaining trade secrets for competitors or using the information for personal business mailing lists. Courts consider the motivation behind the shareholder's request to determine if the purpose is legitimate, balancing the interests of the shareholders and the corporation. Examples illustrate that a purpose may be deemed improper if it lacks substantial relevance to the shareholder's interest in the corporation, such as identifying shareholders to discuss the company's involvement in the Vietnam War, whereas another case shows a proper purpose in communicating about economic risks related to the firm's activities in Angola."

In regular voting, each shareholder receives a number of votes equal to the number of positions to be elected, and these votes must be distributed among the candidates. Cumulative voting allows shareholders to concentrate all of their votes on a single candidate, giving them more influence over the election of a particular director. This method benefits shareholders who wish to support a single candidate or those who believe in a particular director's qualifications, as it enhances their ability to elect that individual."

The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors.

Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation.

If a director has a personal interest in a contract with the corporation, they must ensure that the contract is fair to the corporation.

The current bylaws contain no restrictions against female members or guests. Even if these bylaws could be interpreted as authorizing such restrictions, they would be invalid due to the requirement under Section 33-459(a) of the General Statutes, which mandates that bylaws must be 'reasonable and germane to the purposes of the corporation.'

Their inherent \nvalue lies in the interest in property or an ongoing enterprise that they represent. This disparity between \nthe tangible property—the stock certificate, for example—and the intangible interest it represents gives \nrise to several reasons for regulation. First, there is need for a mechanism to inform the buyer accurately \nwhat it is he is buying. Second, laws are necessary to prevent and provide remedies for deceptive and \nmanipulative acts designed to defraud buyers and sellers. Third, the evolution of stock trading on a \nmassive scale has led to the development of numerous types of specialists and professionals, in dealings \nwith whom the public can be at a severe disadvantage, and so the law undertakes to ensure that they do \nnot take unfair advantage of their customers. \n \nThe Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are two federal statutes that \nare vitally important, having virtually refashioned the law governing corporations during the past half \ncentury. In fact, it is not too much to say that although they deal with securities, they have become the \ngeneral federal law of corporations. This body of federal law has assumed special importance in recent \nyears as the states have engaged in a race to the bottom in attempting to compete with Delaware’s \npermissive corporation law (see Chapter 14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \nWhat Is a Security? \nSecurities law questions are technical and complex and usually require professional counsel. For the \nnonlawyer, the critical question on which all else turns is whether the particular investment or document \nis a security. If it is, anyone attempting any transaction beyond the routine purchase or sale through a \nbroker should consult legal counsel to avoid the various civil and criminal minefields that the law has \nstrewn about. \n \nThe definition of security, which is set forth in the Securities Act of 1933, is comprehensive, but it does \nnot on its face answer all questions that financiers in a dynamic market can raise.

As part of a movement toward deregulation, several states have recently modified or \neliminated merit provisions. \n \nMany of the blue sky laws are inconsistent with each other, making national uniformity difficult. In 1956, \nthe National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws approved the Uniform Securities Act. \nIt has not been designed to reconcile the conflicting philosophies of state regulation but to take them into \naccount and to make the various forms of regulation as consistent as possible. States adopt various \nportions of the law, depending on their regulatory philosophies. The Uniform Securities Act has antifraud, \nbroker-dealer registration, and securities registration provisions. More recent acts have further increased \nuniformity. These include the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which preempted \ndiffering state philosophies with regard to registration of securities and regulation of brokers and \nadvisors, and the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, which preempted state law \nsecurities fraud claims from being raised in class action lawsuits by investors. \n \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \nIn 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \nwhich is the largest amendment to financial regulation in the United States since the Great Depression. \nThis amendment was enacted in response to the economic recession of the late 2000s for the following \npurposes: (1) to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and \ntransparency in the financial system, (2) to end “too big to fail” institutions, (3) to protect the American \ntaxpayer by ending bailouts, and (4) to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices.

Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however.

There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I.

Second, the successor possesses the capability to assume the original manufacturer's role in spreading risks through insurance, which was originally intended to distribute costs among the public.

This is because the negotiability of the note allows the bank to enforce its claim against the maker of the note, regardless of the fact that the rackets were warped. The bank's good faith purchase ensures that it did not know about the defect in the rackets at the time of the transaction."

                    "answer": "Negotiability in the context of commercial paper means that the paper can be freely and unconditionally transferred from one person to another through delivery or by delivery and indorsement. It is crucial for the business world because without this ability, businesses would face significant challenges in paying and financing their operations. Essentially, negotiability empowers a person to transfer to another more than what the transferor himself possesses, allowing the transferee to convey clear title to a subsequent holder, even when the original transferor does not have clear title. This mechanism is vital for facilitating smooth and efficient financial transactions in the business world."

We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument. It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party. When words of \nguaranty do not specify the type, the law presumes a payment guaranty. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n789 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe modern law of commercial paper is, in general, covered by UCC Article 3. The two basic types of \ncommercial paper are drafts and notes. The note is a two-party instrument whereby one person (maker) \npromises to pay money to a second person (payee). The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "question": "What distinguishes an accommodation party's signature on a negotiable instrument and what is their liability under different conditions?",
                    "answer": "An accommodation party is someone who signs a negotiable instrument to provide their name to another party involved in the transaction. Regardless of the capacity in which they sign, whether as a maker, comaker, drawer, codrawer, or indorser, they assume the role of a surety. A surety is essentially someone who guarantees that the primary obligor will fulfill their payment obligations. The extent of the accommodation party's liability to pay hinges on the specific wording added upon signing. If the accommodation party includes phrases like 'payment guaranteed,' they become primarily liable for the payment, meaning they agree to pay if the main signer defaults on the obligation. Conversely, if the phrase 'collection guaranteed' is used, the holder must first attempt to sue the primary signer and secure a court judgment before pursuing the accommodation party for payment. In the absence of explicit language, the law assumes a 'payment guaranty.' This means the accommodation party is automatically responsible for the debt if the primary signer cannot meet their obligations."

Under UCC Section 1-201(43), a forgery is an “unauthorized \nsignature.” Section 3-403(a) provides that any unauthorized signature on an instrument is “ineffective \nexcept as the signature of the unauthorized signer.” The consequence is that, generally, the loss falls on \nthe first party to take the instrument with a forged or unauthorized signature because that person is in the \nbest position to prevent the loss. \n \nLorna Love writes a check to Steve Supplier on her account at First State Bank, but the check goes astray \nand is found by Carl Crooks.

Love \ncalls First State Bank to stop payment. Too late—the check has been cashed. Who bears the loss—Love, \nSupplier, or the bank? The bank does, and it must recredit Love’s account. The forged indorsement on the \ncheck was ineffective; the bank was not a holder, and the check should not have been allowed into the \nchannels of commerce.

As a result, Wachovia's argument that the fictitious payee defense helps them in this case is weakened, because the court must now consider the bank's own negligence in addition to the fraud committed by the company's employee.

                    "question": "What legal protections can the tavern owner take to mitigate the risk of loss if a check is stolen and cashed by a thief, as in the case of Alphonse's situation described in Exercise 3?",
                    "answer": "The tavern owner can take several legal measures to mitigate the risk of loss if a check is stolen and cashed by a thief. First, the owner can require employees to use restrictive endorsements when cashing checks. A restrictive endorsement limits the authority of the employee to cash the check, making it less likely that a thief can successfully cash it. Additionally, the owner can implement better record-keeping practices to track which checks have been cashed and when. This can help identify discrepancies quickly and potentially prevent losses. Another strategy is to require employees to report cashed checks immediately, allowing the owner to investigate and possibly recover funds. Furthermore, the owner can consider requiring employees to sign a written agreement outlining their responsibilities and the consequences of misusing company funds. This can serve as evidence in case of fraud. Lastly, the owner may want to review and update the tavern's insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage against such incidents. By taking these steps, the tavern owner can significantly reduce the risk of financial loss due to theft of cashed checks."

What a holder in due course is, and why that status is critical to commercial paper \n2. What defenses are good against a holder in due course \n3. How the holder-in-due-course doctrine is modified in consumer transactions \n \n \nIn this chapter, we consider the final two questions that are raised in determining whether a holder \ncan collect: \n1. Is the holder a holder in due course? \n2. What defenses, if any, can be asserted against the holder in due course to prevent collection on the \ninstrument? \n \n \n \n21.1 Holder in Due Course \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand why the concept of holder in due course is important in commercial transactions. \n2. Know what the requirements are for being a holder in due course. \n3. Determine whether a payee may be a holder in due course. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n854 \n4. Know what the shelter rule is and why the rule exists. \n \n \n \nOverview of the Holder-in-Due-Course Concept \nImportance of the Holder-in-Due-Course Concept \nA holder is a person in possession of an instrument payable to bearer or to the identified person \npossessing it. But a holder’s rights are ordinary, as we noted briefly in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of \nCommercial Paper\". If a person to whom an instrument is negotiated becomes nothing more than a \nholder, the law of commercial paper would not be very significant, nor would a negotiable instrument be a \nparticularly useful commercial device. A mere holder is simply an assignee, who acquires the assignor’s \nrights but also his liabilities; an ordinary holder must defend against claims and overcome defenses just as \nhis assignor would. The holder in due course is really the crux of the concept of commercial paper and the \nkey to its success and importance. What the holder in due course gets is an instrument free of claims or \ndefenses by previous possessors. A holder with such a preferred position can then treat the instrument \nalmost as money, free from the worry that someone might show up and prove it defective. \n \nRequirements for Being a Holder in Due Course \nUnder Section 3-302 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), to be a holder in due course (HDC), a \ntransferee must fulfill the following: \n1. Be a holder of a negotiable instrument; \n2. Have taken it: \na) for value, \nb) in good faith, \nc) without notice \n(1) that it is overdue or",

                    "question": "What is the significance of the holder in due course in commercial transactions?",
                    "answer": "The significance of the holder in due course in commercial transactions lies in their ability to obtain an instrument free of claims or defenses by previous possessors. This means that a holder in due course can treat the instrument almost like cash, without worrying about someone proving it to be defective. The concept is crucial because if a person merely becomes a holder, the law of commercial paper would not be particularly significant, and negotiable instruments would not be useful commercial devices. Essentially, the holder in due course provides a shield against past issues, allowing them to act as if they have a clean title to the instrument."

Firstly, the transferee must be a holder of a negotiable instrument. Secondly, the transferee must have taken the instrument for value, meaning they provided something of worth in exchange for the instrument. Additionally, the transferee must have acted in good faith, which means they believed the transaction was legitimate and did not have any reason to suspect any wrongdoing. Lastly, the transferee must have taken the instrument without notice of any potential problems, such as the instrument being overdue or having defects. Meeting these requirements grants the transferee the status of a holder in due course, providing them with a preferred position and protection from claims or defenses by previous possessors."

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable",

(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by judicial proceeding. (3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any person, whether or not the claim is due. (4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. (5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation.

                    "answer": "The text discusses several types of financial ratios that provide insights into various aspects of a company's financial health. Operating efficiency ratios, such as asset turnover ratio and inventory turnover ratio, measure how effectively a company uses its assets to generate sales. Liquidity ratios, including the current ratio and quick ratio, assess a company's ability to meet short-term obligations. Solvency ratios, like the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio, evaluate a company's long-term financial stability. Market value ratios, such as price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio, reflect the market's perception of a company's stock value relative to its earnings and book value. Profitability ratios, including gross margin, operating margin, and net profit margin, indicate how efficiently a company generates profits from its operations. The DuPont method combines these ratios to provide a comprehensive view of a company's overall financial performance. These ratios help investors, analysts, and managers understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, identify potential risks, and make informed decisions regarding investments and strategies."

                    "answer": "The text mentions various investment analysis tools such as regression analysis, statistical analysis, and Excel. These tools are crucial for making informed investment decisions. Regression analysis, for example, helps in understanding the relationship between variables and predicting future outcomes. This is discussed in Chapter 14, where it covers topics like correlation analysis, linear regression analysis, and best-fit linear models. Additionally, regression applications in finance, predictions, and prediction intervals are also explored, providing a comprehensive approach to forecasting financial performance. On the other hand, statistical analysis in finance, covered in Chapter 13, includes measures of center, spread, position, and data visualization. These statistical methods help in understanding the historical performance of markets and bonds, as well as the returns to stocks. Furthermore, Excel is utilized as a tool for making investment decisions, particularly in Chapters 15 and 17, where it is used to assess risk and return, calculate the weighted average cost of capital, and choose between projects. Overall, these tools provide a robust framework for analyzing and making decisions in the complex world of finance."

Each chapter begins with a 'Why It Matters' section that highlights the relevance of the topic to real-world scenarios, followed by detailed explanations and examples. Chapters 16 and 17 then shift to company-level investment analysis, covering methods like payback period, net present value, internal rate of return, and capital structure choices. This organization allows readers to build a comprehensive understanding of investment analysis and decision-making, from market performance to individual asset and company-level assessments. Additionally, each chapter concludes with review questions, problems, and video activities to reinforce learning and ensure retention of key concepts."

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you. Think about\nthe type of people you want to work with, the type of work-related activities you enjoy, and where you\nwould like to live.

The study of historical\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty.

This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows.

In practice, many market locales trade both new and used securities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place among individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of Amazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the information provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by investors of their perceptions of firm's value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations."

They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete.

First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships.

This occurs when the corporation's earnings are first taxed, and then any after-tax earnings distributed as dividends to shareholders are taxed once more as personal income.

S corporations are taxed as if they were proprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. However, there are limitations to its use; S corporations can only have up to 100 stockholders. This makes it particularly suitable for relatively small, privately owned firms but unsuitable for larger, more diverse organizations. Therefore, a C corporation, which is subject to corporate income tax but not double taxation, is often preferred by larger companies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital."

It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. When the managers of an automotive company look at the market\nfor steel and how the price of steel impacts the company’s production costs, they are looking at a\nmicroeconomic issue. Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\na general increase in price levels.\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\nhas risen.\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\n76\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInflation means that the purchasing power of currency falls.

While gains and losses are infrequent in\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the",

A saver who decides to hold\n$1,000 in the form of cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% per year will lose\nor $36.50, in purchasing power by the end of that year.\nOrdinarily, interest rates would rise to compensate for negative real rates, but this might not happen if the\nFederal Reserve takes steps to maintain low interest rates to help stimulate and stabilize the economy. When\ninterest rates are at such low levels, investors are forced out of Treasury and money market investments due\nto their extremely poor returns.\nIt soon becomes obvious that the time value of money is a critical concept because of its tremendous and\ndirect impact on the daily spending, saving, and investment decisions of the people in our society. It is\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\nCompounding Interest\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples",

For instance, holding $1,000 in cash for one year at a negative real interest rate of −3.65% results in a loss of $36.50 in purchasing power. This loss occurs because the nominal interest rate does not fully offset the effects of inflation, reducing the actual value of the saved money over time."

                    "question": "How does compounding interest work, and why is it beneficial for savings over time?",
                    "answer": "Compounding interest is the process where interest is earned on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. For example, starting with $1,000 at a 10% annual interest rate, after one year, the total amount grows to $1,100. In the second year, interest is earned on the new total, which means the interest earned is higher. By the end of five years, the $1,000 would grow to approximately $1,610. This demonstrates that investing money in an account with compounding interest provides a significant advantage over simply keeping the money idle, especially considering that even modest inflation rates over time diminish the value of non-invested funds. Compounding interest thus enhances the time value of money, making it crucial for informed financial decision-making and improving overall personal financial health."

In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year.

This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates.

Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015.

This action not only significantly reduces the total interest paid over the life of the loan but also decreases the overall cost of financing. For instance, in the given scenario, the total interest is reduced from over $56,000 to $55,000, demonstrating the substantial financial benefit of prepaying long-term debts early."

                    "answer": "The concept of effective interest rates differs from stated interest rates in that effective rates take into account the compounding of interest within a one-year period, whereas stated rates do not. When interest is compounded more frequently than annually, the effective annual rate is higher than the stated rate. This is important to understand because it provides a more accurate representation of the true cost of borrowing. For example, a stated rate of 1.5% per month would compound to an effective annual rate of 19.56%, which is significantly higher than the 18% that might be incorrectly assumed by simply multiplying the monthly rate by 12. This difference becomes crucial for both debtors and investors, as it affects the actual amount of interest paid or earned over time."

This process leads to a total of $35,062.27 after seven years, assuming an initial investment of $2,000 for the first four years, $12,000 for the fifth year, $5,000 for the sixth year, and $2,000 for the seventh year, with an assumed interest rate of 7%."

This\npresent value amount will then be added to the present value of a single lump sum payment (the principal or\nface value) that will come to the bondholder at the end of the bond’s term (maturity).\nFixed Income\nBecause standard fixed-rate bonds have their coupon payments and maturity amounts locked in, they are\noften referred to as fixed-income investments. This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

                    "answer": "Adjusting bond variables for semiannual compounding periods involves halving the annual interest rates and doubling the number of periods. For example, if the annual coupon rate is 4%, it becomes 2% per period for semiannual compounding. Similarly, the time to maturity in years needs to be doubled to reflect the number of semiannual periods. This adjustment is crucial because the present value of future cash flows changes due to more frequent compounding, which impacts the bond's price. To calculate the new price, one would input these adjusted variables into a financial calculator or an Excel spreadsheet designed for bond pricing."

When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies.

The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings.

The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and\nessentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,12 and the owners of a private\ncompany going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the\nmonths following an IPO.\nA SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from\nRenaissance Capital reports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89\nhave completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the\ncommon shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares\nwith the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.13\nSequence of Trade Execution\nInvestors who wish to trade stocks (buy or sell) execute trades via a broker.

                    "answer": "A Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) is a unique form of Initial Public Offering (IPO). Unlike a traditional IPO where a firm with a proven product or service and a documented operational and financial history initiates the process to raise capital by going public, a SPAC operates differently. In a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a suitable firm to acquire, essentially putting the cart before the horse. This means that instead of a company being ready to go public, the SPAC is formed to find a target company to merge with. SPACs are sometimes referred to as 'blank check' companies because investors are providing capital to a firm that has no assets, with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment. The formation of a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Since the money raised by the SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is less complex, less expensive, and less time-consuming compared to a traditional IPO. While some SPACs may have a target company in mind when they are formed, this is not a requirement. Once a SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and merge with the target."

Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century.

                    "answer": "The wide range of returns on T-bond portfolios from 1980 to 1999 was primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates. In the late 1970s, high rates of inflation and interest rates led to lower bond prices. However, when these rates began to fall in late 1981, bond prices rose, leading to very large returns on T-bond portfolios. The year 1982 saw the highest annual return of 32.81% in this 20-year period. Conversely, in 1999, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to address the overheating stock market caused by dot-com speculation, bond prices fell, resulting in a -8.25% return on bond portfolios.

                    "answer": "Baa bonds, which are mid-tier corporate bonds that carry some credit risk, performed similarly to T-bonds over the four decades from 1980 to 2020. From 1980 to 1999, Baa bonds outperformed T-bonds by an average annual premium of 1.86%, reflecting the additional risk premium required by investors for holding these bonds. This trend continued into the 2000s, where Baa bonds realized an even larger average annual premium of 2.30% over T-bonds. This difference in performance implies that the risk premium for Baa bonds is necessary to compensate investors for the added credit risk they face compared to the default-risk free T-bonds."

Historically, small company stocks have shown larger average annual returns along with greater variability compared to large companies.

Specifically, the Wilshire US Small-Cap Index has averaged an annual compound return of 12.13%, while the Wilshire US Large Cap Index has averaged 11.82% over the same period. Although there remains a slight premium for small-cap stocks, it is notably smaller than the historical gap, which was around 1.76 percentage points during the 1926-2019 period.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\nStocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets\ndiscussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and\nreceive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for\nportfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.\nThe negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money\nmarket or debt market instruments.\nKey Terms\nbond returns\nsums the periodic interest payments and the change in bond price in a given period and\ndivides by the bond price at the beginning of the period\ncommercial paper (CP)\na short-term, unsecured security issued by corporations and financial institutions to\nmeet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables\ndebenture\na common type of unsecured bond issued by a corporation\nindenture\nlegal term for a bond contract\ninflation",

Figure 13.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.\nFigure 13.2 Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.\nRelationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\nIn the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the\nstandard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nOnce you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n389\nOne disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured in square units, which are different\nfrom the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the\nvariance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\n13.3\nMeasures of Position\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\n•\nDefine and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\n•\nUse quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\nz-Scores",

                    "answer": "To create a frequency distribution table for portfolio values with a class width of 300, you first define the intervals based on the class width. For instance, starting from 0, the first interval would be 0-299, followed by 300-599, 600-899, and so on. Each interval represents a range of portfolio values. Next, you count the number of data points that fall within each interval, which gives you the frequency for each row. Then, to calculate the relative frequency, you divide the frequency of each row by the total number of data points, which is 20 in this case. This results in a table where the first column lists the portfolio value intervals, the second column records the frequency of clients falling into each interval, and the third column shows the relative frequency of those clients. The frequency distribution table for the given data shows that the majority of clients have portfolio values between $300,000 and $599,000, as indicated by the highest frequency in the second row. This distribution also suggests a bell-shaped curve, with fewer clients having portfolios significantly higher or lower than this central range."

For\nexample, we can assign a probability to the outcome of a certain stock increasing in value or decreasing in\nvalue. One application of a probability distribution function is determining expected value.\nIn many financial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. To calculate expected returns, we\nformulate a probability distribution and then use the following formula to calculate expected value:\nwhere P1, P2, P3, ⋯Pn are the probabilities of the various returns and R1, R2, R3, ⋯Rn are the various rates of\nreturn.\nIn essence, expected value is a weighted mean where the probabilities form the weights.

                    "answer": "To calculate the expected return of an investment using a probability distribution, you first need to identify the possible returns and their associated probabilities. These probabilities and returns are used in the expected value formula: Expected Value = Σ (Pn * Rn), where Pn represents the probability of the nth return and Rn represents the nth rate of return. For example, consider the historical returns for United Airlines common stock: a 15% probability of a 12% return, a 35% probability of a 5% return, a 25% probability of a 2% return, a 14% probability of a 5% loss, and an 11% probability of a 10% loss. Organizing this data into a probability distribution table, you can apply the formula to find the expected return. The expected return calculation for United Airlines stock would be: (0.15 * 12%) + (0.35 * 5%) + (0.25 * 2%) + (0.14 * -5%) + (0.11 * -10%) = 2.25%. This method provides a weighted average of the possible returns, taking into account the likelihood of each outcome, thus giving a clearer picture of the anticipated performance of the investment over time."

Correlation measures how closely the returns of two different assets move in relation to each other. If the correlation coefficient between stock funds and bond funds is low, it means that the returns of these two asset classes tend to move independently of each other. This independence is beneficial for portfolio diversification because it reduces overall risk. When one asset class performs poorly, another may perform well, thereby smoothing out the overall portfolio performance. For investors, understanding the correlation between stock funds and bond funds is crucial for designing a balanced portfolio that aligns with their risk tolerance and investment goals.

                    "answer": "The geometric average return is smaller than the arithmetic average return because it accounts for the effects of compounding. For instance, when calculating the average return over multiple periods, the geometric average return takes into consideration the multiplicative nature of returns, whereas the arithmetic average simply adds up the returns and divides by the number of periods. This means that if there are periods with both gains and losses, the geometric average will reflect the true compounded growth, which can be less than the simple average of the individual returns due to the volatility of the investment."

                    "answer": "Reversing the cash flow sequence of Trim Corp.'s project would likely decrease its NPV because the earlier cash inflows are discounted less than those occurring later. This is due to the time value of money principle, which states that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. The NPV calculation for the reversed cash flows at a 25% discount rate can be computed as follows: First, calculate the present value of each cash inflow using the formula PV = CF / (1 + r)^t, where CF is the cash flow, r is the discount rate, and t is the time period. Then, sum these present values and subtract the initial investment. Assuming the initial investment is not specified, we will assume it to be zero for simplicity. The NPV for the reversed cash flows would be: NPV = -150/(1+0.25)^1 - 250/(1+0.25)^2 - 350/(1+0.25)^3. Plugging in the numbers, the NPV would be approximately -351.84. This outcome aligns with the intuition that reversing the cash flows reduces the overall value of the project, as the benefits are realized later when their present value is lower."

In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to",

Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth.

Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change.

A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits.

Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding.

This additional expense, combined with an existing projected cash deficit of $13,000 at the end of the first quarter, could necessitate significant funding.

In personal finance, financial resiliency is the ability to overcome financial difficulties such as sudden\njob loss or significant unexpected expenses—to spring back quickly.\nTo help promote resiliency, personal financial planners advise clients to maintain liquid assets equal to three\nto six months of living expenses, keep debt levels low, manage the household budget, keep insurance in force\n(health, property, and life), establish a solid credit history, and make wise use of credit cards and home equity\nlines of credit.\nIn business finance, financial resiliency is not important only during pandemics but is important through the",

Managing cash, accounts receivable, and\ninventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its\noperating needs and pays its debts when due.\nWorking capital management is also critical during good times. Even though profits might be rising, a business\nwith growing demand for its products and services still needs to have working capital management tools to\npay its bills. Growth in sales and profits do not immediately mean sufficient cash flow, so planning ahead with\ntools such as a cash budget is key.\nThe Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\n19\n19 • Why It Matters\n565\n19.1\nWhat Is Working Capital?\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine working capital.\n•\nCalculate a firm’s operating cycle and cash cycle.\n•\nCompute inventory days, accounts receivable days, and accounts payable days.\nThe concept of business capital is often associated with the cash and assets (such as land and equipment) that\nthe owners contributed to the business. Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified\nthis concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.\nThat general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about\na specific type of capital— working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital\ndescribes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.\nEmployees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise\norders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well\nmanagement plans and controls working capital.\nUnderstanding working capital begins with the concept of current assets—those resources of a business that\nare cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the\nbusiness. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.",

In business finance, financial resiliency is crucial throughout various economic conditions, including seasonal cycles and economic downturns, rather than just during pandemics. It involves managing cash, accounts receivable, and inventory efficiently while taking advantage of trade credit (accounts payable) to ensure that the business can meet its operational needs and pay its debts on time. Even during periods of increasing sales and profits, businesses must plan ahead with tools such as cash budgets to ensure adequate cash flow, as growth in sales and profits does not automatically guarantee sufficient cash flow."

Because exchange rates are volatile, the dollar value of the asset will vary\ndepending on the day on which the translation takes place. If the exchange rate is 500 colones to the dollar,\nthen this coffee plantation is an asset with a value of $240,000. If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance.

                    "answer": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) primarily focuses on regulating the securities industry to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. Key terms associated with SEC include 'Securities Exchange Act of 1934', which outlines the rules and regulations for the issuance and trading of securities; 'SIPC' or Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which provides protection to investors in case their brokerage firm fails; and 'shelf registration', a process that allows companies to file a registration statement for a future offering of securities. Additionally, the SEC oversees various financial instruments like 'SPACs' or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, and manages the 'Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index'."

                    "question": "Which financial concepts and ratios are commonly used in assessing the performance and risk of an investment portfolio, and how are they defined?",
                    "answer": "Several financial concepts and ratios are frequently utilized in evaluating the performance and risk of an investment portfolio. For instance, 'standard deviation' measures the dispersion of returns around the average return, indicating the volatility of an investment. The 'Sharpe ratio' assesses the risk-adjusted return of an investment by comparing the excess return per unit of deviation in the investment. 'Slope' refers to the measure of the steepness of a line, often used in regression analysis to determine the relationship between variables. Another important concept is 'time value of money (TVM)', which recognizes that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. Furthermore, the 'Treynor ratio' evaluates the return of an investment compared to the market risk, specifically beta, making it a useful tool for assessing the performance of mutual funds and other investment vehicles."
