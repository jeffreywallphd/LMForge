This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni. Etzioni was a founder of the \nCommunitarian Network, which is a group of individuals who have come together to bolster the moral, \nsocial, and political environment. It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

                    "answer": "Appellate courts play a crucial role in the legal system by reviewing decisions made by lower courts to ensure that the procedures followed during the trial were correct and that the applicable law was properly applied. Unlike the lower courts where juries decide the facts, appellate courts do not retry the evidence but instead focus on procedural correctness and legal application. The appellant, who is the party that lost in the lower court, can appeal to an intermediate appellate court, usually referred to as a court of appeal, in forty states. The appellee, who won in the lower court, can argue to affirm the lower court's decision. Appellate courts have several options including affirming, modifying, reversing, or remanding the case back to the lower court for retrial. If the case involves significant federal constitutional issues, the losing party can potentially appeal to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, though this is a rare occurrence as the Supreme Court typically selects the cases it wishes to hear."

A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial. \nFor the most part, courts of appeal will not reverse and remand for a new trial unless the trial court \njudge’s errors are “prejudicial,” or “an abuse of discretion.” In short, neither party is entitled to a perfect \ntrial, but only to a fair trial, one in which the trial judge has made only “harmless errors” and not \nprejudicial ones. \n \nAt the end of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant presents his case, following the same procedure just \noutlined. The plaintiff is then entitled to present rebuttal witnesses, if necessary, to deny or argue with the \nevidence the defendant has introduced. The defendant in turn may present “surrebuttal” witnesses. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n114 \n \nWhen all testimony has been introduced, either party may ask the judge for a directed verdict—a \nverdict decided by the judge without advice from the jury. This motion may be granted if the plaintiff has \nfailed to introduce evidence that is legally sufficient to meet her burden of proof or if the defendant has \nfailed to do the same on issues on which she has the burden of proof. (For example, the plaintiff alleges \nthat the defendant owes him money and introduces a signed promissory note. The defendant cannot show \nthat the note is invalid. The defendant must lose the case unless he can show that the debt has been paid \nor otherwise discharged.) \n \nThe defendant can move for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s case, but the judge will usually \nwait to hear the entire case until deciding whether to do so. Directed verdicts are not usually granted, \nsince it is the jury’s job to determine the facts in dispute. \n \nIf the judge refuses to grant a directed verdict, each lawyer will then present a closing argument to the \njury (or, if there is no jury, to the judge alone). The closing argument is used to tie up the loose ends, as \nthe attorney tries to bring together various seemingly unrelated facts into a story that will make sense to \nthe jury. \n \nAfter closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury. The purpose of jury instruction is to explain to \nthe jurors the meaning of the law as it relates to the issues they are considering and to tell the jurors what \nfacts they must determine if they are to give a verdict for one party or the other. Each lawyer will have \nprepared a set of written instructions that she hopes the judge will give to the jury. These will be tailored \nto advance her client’s case. Many a verdict has been overturned on appeal because a trial judge has \nwrongly instructed the jury. The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict. Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is.

The plaintiff then has the opportunity to present rebuttal witnesses to counter the defendant's evidence, followed by the defendant's surrebuttal witnesses.

In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1.

The application of that rule will vary \nwith the quality and nature of the defendant’s activity, but it is essential in each case that there be \nsome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities \nwithin the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. \n \nThis “purposeful availment” requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a jurisdiction \nsolely as a result of “random,” “fortuitous,” or “attenuated” contacts, or of the “unilateral activity of \nanother party or a third person,” [Citations] Jurisdiction is proper, however, where the contacts \nproximately result from actions by the defendant himself that create a “substantial connection” with the \nforum State. [Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities \nwithin a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he \nmanifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are \nshielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to \nrequire him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. \n \nJurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically \nenter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320.

Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has declined to do so. What follows is a \nstatement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant \namounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada. \n \nDealing with Unwelcome Waste \nSenator Carl Levin, January 2003 \nMichigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other \nstates and Canada. \n \nCanada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan. Approximately 65 truckloads of waste \ncome in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from \nCanada each day. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n156 \nThis problem isn’t going to get any better. Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto \narea signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills. At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two \ncountries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement. To protect both countries, the \nagreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that \nthe importing country may withdraw consent for shipments. Both reasons are evidence that these \nshipments were intended to be limited. However, the agreement’s provisions have not been \nenforced by the United States. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n157 \nCanada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not \nimplemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan. Although those of \nus that introduced this legislation believe that the Environmental Protection Agency has the \nauthority to enforce this agreement, they have not done so. Our bill would require the EPA \n[Environmental Protection Agency] to enforce the agreement. \n \nIn order to protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Michigan and our environment, we \nmust consider the impact of the importation of trash on state and local recycling efforts, landfill",

Despite having approximately six times the land mass of Michigan, Ontario's extensive search for a suitable landfill site has proven unsuccessful. As a result, the majority of Toronto's waste is being sent to Michigan for disposal. This situation poses several environmental concerns, such as groundwater contamination, noise pollution, and foul odors. Additionally, the increased use of Michigan's landfills by out-of-state waste significantly reduces the state's available landfill capacity, potentially leading to a shortage of disposal options and exacerbating existing environmental issues."

Ex parte (eks PAR-tay) communications—contacts \nbetween the ALJ and outsiders or one party when both parties are not present—are prohibited. However, \nthe usual burden-of-proof standard followed in a civil proceeding in court does not apply: the ALJ is not \nbound to decide in favor of that party producing the more persuasive evidence. The rule in most \nadministrative proceedings is “substantial evidence,” evidence that is not flimsy or weak, but is not \nnecessarily overwhelming evidence, either. The ALJ in most cases will write an opinion. That opinion is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n217 \nnot the decision of the agency, which can be made only by the commissioners or agency head. In effect, \nthe ALJ’s opinion is appealed to the commission itself. \n \nCertain types of agency actions that have a direct impact on individuals need not be filtered through a full-\nscale hearing. Safety and quality inspections (grading of food, inspection of airplanes) can be made on the \nspot by skilled inspectors. Certain licenses can be administered through tests without a hearing (a test for \na driver’s license), and some decisions can be made by election of those affected (labor union elections). \n \nRulemaking \nTrial-type hearings generally impose on particular parties liabilities based on past or present facts. \nBecause these cases will serve as precedents, they are a partial guide to future conduct by others. But they \ndo not directly apply to nonparties, who may argue in a subsequent case that their conduct does not fit \nwithin the holding announced in the case. Agencies can affect future conduct far more directly by \nannouncing rules that apply to all who come within the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \nThe acts creating most of the major federal agencies expressly grant them authority to engage in \nrulemaking. This means, in essence, authority to legislate. The outpouring of federal regulations has been \nimmense. The APA directs agencies about to engage in rulemaking to give notice in the \nFederal Register of their intent to do so. The Federal Register is published daily, Monday through \nFriday, in Washington, DC, and contains notice of various actions, including announcements of proposed \nrulemaking and regulations as adopted. The notice must specify the time, place, and nature of the \nrulemaking and offer a description of the proposed rule or the issues involved. Any interested person or \norganization is entitled to participate by submitting written “data, views or arguments.” Agencies are not \nlegally required to air debate over proposed rules, though they often do so. \n \nThe procedure just described is known as “informal” rulemaking. A different procedure is required for \n“formal” rulemaking, defined as those instances in which the enabling legislation directs an agency to \nmake rules “on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing.” When engaging in formal rulemaking, \nagencies must hold an adversary hearing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n218 \n \nAdministrative regulations are not legally binding unless they are published.

While it is difficult to show that \nan agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead?

In 1960 defendant \nWinifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and \nreceiving clients who came to the office. \n \nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and \nanother at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar \ndid not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month \nNathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan $5,000 and $4,000 \non the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes \nagain. \n \nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office \nMrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on \nDecember 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for $5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage \nformerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of $3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two \npersonal notes in the sums of $5,250.00 and $4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan. \n \nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did \nnot present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n270 \nthe complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not \nfirst mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two \nvacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a \ncomplaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses. \n \nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the \ninformation. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the \ncrime of theft. Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert \nthat complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security. If he extends credit in reliance upon security which is \nfalsely represented to be adequate, he has been defrauded even if the debtor intends to repay the debt. His \nposition is now that of an unsecured creditor. At the very least, an unreasonable risk of loss has been \nforced upon him by reason of the deceit. This risk which he did not intend to assume has been imposed \nupon him by the intentional act of the debtor, and such action constitutes an intent to defraud. \n \n* * * \n \nThe cases cited by defendants in support of their contention are distinguishable from the instant case in \nthat they involved theft by larceny. Since the crime of larceny is designed to protect a person’s possessory \ninterest in property whereas the crime of false pretenses protects one’s title interest, the requirement of a \npermanent deprivation is appropriate to the former. Accordingly, we hold that an intent to repay a loan \nobtained on the basis of a false representation of the security for the loan is no defense. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n271 \n \n* * * \n \nAffirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. False pretenses is a crime of obtaining ownership of property of another by making untrue representations \nof fact with intent to defraud. What were the untrue representations of fact made by Mills? \n2. Concisely state the defendant’s argument as to why Pivowar has not been deprived of any property. \n3.

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the",

It includes intentional acts, such as willful conduct where the defendant intentionally injures another, which is clearly actionable. However, it also includes negligence, where the conduct is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage, but without the specific intent to harm. Unlike criminal law, tort law does not require a specific intent to commit a wrongful act; instead, it focuses on the injury to the plaintiff. Tort law is less concerned with the reasons behind the defendant's actions and can hold an innocent act or a relatively innocent one liable for damages.

            "chunk": "Determining negligence is not always easy. If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him. Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide. Rarely \nis it a legal question that a judge can settle. \nThe tort of negligence has four elements: (1) a duty of due care that the defendant had, (2) \nthe breach of the duty of due care, (3) connection between cause and injury, and (4) actual damage or \nloss. Even if a plaintiff can prove each of these aspects, the defendant may be able to show that the law \nexcuses the conduct that is the basis for the tort claim. We examine each of these factors below. \n \nStandard of Care \nNot every unintentional act that causes injury is negligent. If you brake to a stop when you see a child dart \nout in front of your car, and if the noise from your tires gives someone in a nearby house a heart attack, \nyou have not acted negligently toward the person in the house. The purpose of the negligence standard is \nto protect others against the risk of injury that foreseeably would ensue from unreasonably dangerous \nconduct. \n \nGiven the infinite variety of human circumstances and conduct, no general statement of a reasonable \nstandard of care is possible. Nevertheless, the law has tried to encapsulate it in the form of the famous \nstandard of “the reasonable man.” This fictitious person “of ordinary prudence” is the model that juries \nare instructed to compare defendants with in assessing whether those defendants have acted negligently. \nAnalysis of this mythical personage has baffled several generations of commentators. How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot? (Answer: in most cases, yes.) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n299 \nDespite the many difficulties, the concept of the reasonable man is one on which most negligence cases \nultimately turn. If a defendant has acted “unreasonably under the circumstances” and his conduct posed \nan unreasonable risk of injury, then he is liable for injury caused by his conduct. Perhaps in most \ninstances, it is not difficult to divine what the reasonable man would do. The reasonable man stops for \ntraffic lights and always drives at reasonable speeds, does not throw baseballs through windows, performs \nsurgical operations according to the average standards of the medical profession, ensures that the floors of \nhis grocery store are kept free of fluids that would cause a patron to slip and fall, takes proper precautions \nto avoid spillage of oil from his supertanker, and so on. The \"reasonable man\" standard imposes hindsight \non the decisions and actions of people in society; the circumstances of life are such that courts may \nsometimes impose a standard of due care that many people might not find reasonable. \n \nDuty of Care and Its Breach \nThe law does not impose on us a duty to care for every person. If the rule were otherwise, we would all, in \nthis interdependent world, be our brothers’ keepers, constantly unsure whether any action we took might \nsubject us to liability for its effect on someone else. The law copes with this difficulty by limiting the \nnumber of people toward whom we owe a duty to be careful. \n \nIn general, the law imposes no obligation to act in a situation to which we are strangers. We may pass the \ndrowning child without risking a lawsuit. But if we do act, then the law requires us to act carefully. The \nlaw of negligence requires us to behave with due regard for the foreseeable consequences of our actions in \norder to avoid unreasonable risks of injury. \n \nDuring the course of the twentieth century, the courts have constantly expanded the notion of \n“foreseeability,” so that today many more people are held to be within the zone of injury than was once the \ncase. For example, it was once believed that a manufacturer or supplier owed a duty of care only to \nimmediate purchasers, not to others who might use the product or to whom the product might be resold.",

University of Denver \n744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n313 \nOn June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while \nattempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline. The injury rendered him a \nquadriplegic. The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated \non the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus. At the time of his injury, \nWhitlock was twenty years old, attended the University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, \nwhere he held the office of acting house manager. The property on which the Beta house was located was \nleased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of \nDenver. \n \nWhitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines. He began using trampolines in junior high \nschool and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip. Whitlock testified that he \nutilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months. He began jumping on \nthe trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977. Whitlock recounted that in the fall and \nspring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily. He testified further that \nprior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between \nseventy-five and one hundred times. \n \nDuring the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta \nhouse, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken \nuntil 2:00 p.m. on June 19. He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 \np.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at \nthe Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of \nthe fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area. \nAs Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his \nhead, causing his neck to break. \n \nWhitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta \nTheta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n314 \nthe Beta Theta Pi organizations. Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except \nthe University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial. The jury returned a \nverdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000. The jury attributed twenty-eight \npercent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to \nthe conduct of the University.

Long Island R.R. \n248 N.Y. 339,162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928) \n \nCARDOZO, Chief Judge \n \nPlaintiff was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach. \nA train stopped at the station, bound for another place. Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men \nreached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving. The other man, \ncarrying a package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall. A guard on the car, \nwho had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed \nhim from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small \nsize, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by a newspaper. In fact it contained fireworks, but there \nwas nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded. The \nshock of· the explosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform many feet away. The \nscales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues. \n \nThe conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a \nwrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. \nNothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus \nremoved. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the \nviolation of a right. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.…If no hazard was apparent to \nthe eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to \nher, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not \none involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to someone else.…The plaintiff sues in her own \nright for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n321 \nA different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions. A guard stumbles over \na package which has been left upon a platform. \n \nIt seems to be a bundle of newspapers. It turns out to be a can of dynamite. To the eye of ordinary \nvigilance, the bundle is abandoned waste, which may be kicked or trod on with impunity. Is a passenger at \nthe other end of the platform protected by the law against the unsuspected hazard concealed beneath the \nwaste? If not, is the result to be any different, so far as the distant passenger is concerned, when the guard \nstumbles over a valise which a truckman or a porter has left upon the walk?…The orbit of the danger as \ndisclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty. One who jostles one’s neighbor \nin a crowd does not invade the rights of others standing at the outer fringe when the unintended contact \ncasts a bomb upon the ground. The wrongdoer as to them is the man who carries the bomb, not the one \nwho explodes it without suspicion of the danger. Life will have to be made over, and human nature \ntransformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the norm of conduct, the customary \nstandard to which behavior must conform. \n \nThe argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings of such words as “wrong” and \n“wrongful” and shares their instability. For what the plaintiff must show is a “wrong” to herself; i.e., a \nviolation of her own right, and not merely a “wrong” to someone else, nor conduct “wrongful” because \nunsocial, but not a “wrong” to anyone. We are told that one who drives at reckless speed through a \ncrowded city street is guilty of a negligent act and therefore of a wrongful one, irrespective of the \nconsequences. \n \nNegligent the act is, and wrongful in the sense that it is unsocial, but wrongful and unsocial in relation to",

The decision to reverse the judgment and remand the case to the trial court for dismissal of Whitlock’s complaint against the University is based on the principle that the imposition of liability could undermine the important value of student autonomy and independence in an educational setting."

Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner \nthat is important to business. The parties create contract duties through a bargaining process. The \nkey element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the \nfreedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Understand some fundamental contract taxonomy and terminology. \n \n \nThe Role of Contract in Society \nContract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to a deeply held \nconviction about the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that",

            "chunk": "other general duties as recognized in agency law. \n2. Recognize that the principal owes the agent duties: contract, tort, and workers’ compensation. \n \n \nAgent’s Duty to Principal \nThe agent owes the principal duties in two categories: the fiduciary duty and a set of general duties \nimposed by agency law. But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course. \n \nBut the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the \nborder of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest. The penalty for \nbreach of fiduciary duty is loss of compensation and profit and possible damages for breach of trust. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n383 \n \nDuty to Preserve Confidential Information \nTo further his objectives, a principal will usually need to reveal a number of secrets to his agent—how \nmuch he is willing to sell or pay for property, marketing strategies, and the like. Such information could \neasily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or \nwere to sell the information to those who do. The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own \npurposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or \nacquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the \nagent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books \nor memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s \nexpense.” [1] Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency. Though he is free, \nin the absence of contract, to compete with his former principal, he may not use information learned in \nthe course of his agency, such as trade secrets and customer lists. Section 9.3.3 \"Breach of Fiduciary \nDuty\", Bacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc., deals with an agent’s breach of the duty of confidentiality. \n \nOther Duties \nIn addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific \ncontract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to \nagents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts. \n \nDuty of Skill and Care \nAn agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. \nThe agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality \nfor the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are \ngreater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community. In short, \nthe agent may not lawfully do a sloppy job. [2] \n \nDuty of Good Conduct \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n384 \nIn the absence of an agreement, a principal may not ordinarily dictate how an agent must live his private \nlife. An overly fastidious florist may not instruct her truck driver to steer clear of the local bar on his way \nhome from delivering flowers at the end of the day. But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars. A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized",

For example, a purchasing agent hired by a broker cannot sell to the principal through a company where the agent or their family has a financial interest. Additionally, an agent must not use confidential information given by the principal for their own benefit or after resigning from the agency.

In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

The suit for damages arose out of an assault, including rape, committed with a knife and \nother weapons upon the plaintiff on May 9, 1972, by Michael Carey, a nineteen-year-old deliveryman for \nPep Line Trucking Company, Inc. Three months after the trial, Judge Parker set aside the verdict and \nrendered judgment for both defendants notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiff appealed.… \n \nAlthough the assault was perhaps at the outer bounds of respondeat superior, the case was properly one \nfor the jury. Whether the assault in this case was the outgrowth of a job-related controversy or simply a \npersonal adventure of the deliveryman, was a question for the jury. This was the import of the trial judge’s \ninstructions. The verdict as to Pep Line should not have been disturbed. \nIrene Lyon bought a mattress and springs for her bed from the defendant George’s Radio and Television \nCompany, Inc. The merchandise was to be delivered on May 9, 1972.

Her description of what happened is sufficiently brief and \nunqualified that it will bear repeating in full.

The fax cover sheet contained the address, telephone \nnumber, and fax number of the business. Listed under this information was “Gary, Reggie, or Mark \nChavers.” Epsco argues that Gary, Reggie, and Mark are all listed on the fax cover sheet, and that this \nindicates that they were holding themselves out to the public as partners of the business. The trial court’s \nfinding that the fax cover sheet indicated that Reggie and Mark were holding themselves out as partners \nof CWC is not clearly erroneous. \n \nThe Epsco Personnel Credit Application \nEpsco introduced Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 9, a personnel credit application, which was received from CWC. \nAdams testified that the exhibit represented a completed credit application that she received from CWC. \nThe type of business checked on the credit application is “partnership.” Adams testified that the \napplication showed the company to be a partnership, and that this information was relied upon in \nextending credit. Clegg testified that he viewed the credit application which indicated that CWC was a \npartnership, and that his decision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was \na partnership. Gary denied filling out the credit application form. \n \nIt was within the trial court’s discretion to find Adams’s and Clegg’s testimony more credible than Gary’s \ntestimony and to determine that Epsco relied on the statement of partnership on the credit application \nbefore extending credit to CWC. The trial court’s finding concerning the credit application is not clearly \nerroneous. \n \n \n \nThe Checks to Epsco \nEpsco argues that Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11, checks written to Epsco showing the \nCWC account to be in the name of “Gary A. or Reggie J. Chavers,” indicates that Reggie was holding \nhimself out to be a partner of CWC. Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 3 was signed by Gary, and Plaintiff’s Exhibit # 11 \nwas signed by Reggie.

Gary testified that \nthe business cards were printed incorrectly, and that Reggie’s name should not have been included as an \nowner. He also testified that some of the cards might have been handed out, and that it was possible that \nhe might have given one of the cards to a business listed as one of CWC’s credit references on Plaintiff’s \nExhibit # 1. \n \nThe business card listing Reggie as an owner indicates that Reggie was holding himself out as a partner. \nAs we stated in [Citation] when a person holds himself out as a member of partnership, any one dealing \nwith the firm on the faith of such representation is entitled to assume the relation continues until notice of \nsome kind is given of its discontinuance.

By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

Initially, corporations were creatures of the state or church, and their operation required a royal grant, which came to be known as the concession theory.

This trend was exemplified by the granting of charters to large foreign trading companies like the Russia Company, the British East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and the South Sea Company. These companies were joint-stock entities, allowing individuals to invest capital, share profits, and limit personal liability. However, the enthusiasm for such ventures often led to speculative bubbles, such as the one in 1720, where the South Sea Company's promise of retiring the national debt and making everyone rich sparked a frenzy that ended in a financial crisis when the bubble burst. This crisis led to the enactment of the Bubble Act, which further restricted corporate formation, and corporate law development stagnated for some time."

[RKO], as seller, entered into an agreement of sale \nwith Jack Jenofsky and Ralph Graziano, as purchasers. This agreement contemplated the sale of the Kent \nTheatre, a parcel of improved commercial real estate located at Cumberland and Kensington Avenues in \nPhiladelphia, for a total purchase price of $70,000. Settlement was originally scheduled for September \n30, 1970, and, at the request of Jenofsky and Graziano, continued twice, first to October 16, 1970, and \nthen to October 21, 1970. However, Jenofsky and Graziano failed to complete settlement on the last \nscheduled date. \n \nSubsequently, on November 13, 1970, RKO filed a complaint in equity seeking judicial enforcement of the \nagreement of sale. Although Jenofsky, in his answer to the complaint, denied personal liability for the \nperformance of the agreement, the chancellor, after a hearing, entered a decree nisi granting the \nrequested relief sought by RKO.…This appeal ensued. \nAt the time of the execution of this agreement, Jenofsky and Graziano were engaged in promoting the \nformation of a corporation to be known as Kent Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting these efforts, Paragraph 19 of \nthe agreement, added by counsel for Jenofsky and Graziano, recited: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n619 \nIt is understood by the parties hereto that it is the intention of the Purchaser to incorporate. Upon \ncondition that such incorporation be completed by closing, all agreements, covenants, and warranties \ncontained herein shall be construed to have been made between Seller and the resultant corporation and \nall documents shall reflect same. \n \nIn fact, Jenofsky and Graziano did file Articles of Incorporation for Kent Enterprises, Inc., with the State \nCorporation Bureau on October 9, 1971, twelve days prior to the scheduled settlement date. Jenofsky now \ncontends the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation \npapers, released him from any personal liability resulting from the non-performance of the agreement. \n \nThe legal relationship of Jenofsky to Kent Enterprises, Inc., at the date of the execution of the agreement \nof sale was that of promoter. As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. \n \n[T]here [are] three possible understandings that parties may have when an agreement is executed by a \npromoter on behalf of a proposed corporation: \nWhen a party is acting for a proposed corporation, he cannot, of course, bind it by anything he does, at the \ntime, but he may (1) take on its behalf an offer from the other which, being accepted after the formation of \nthe company, becomes a contract; (2) make a contract at the time binding himself, with the stipulation or \nunderstanding, that if a company is formed it will take his place and that then he shall be relieved of \nresponsibility; or (3) bind himself personally without more and look to the proposed company, when \nformed, for indemnity. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n620 \n \nBoth RKO and Jenofsky concede the applicability of alternative No. 2 to the instant case. That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date.

What are some similarities and differences between private equity and venture \ncapital? \n \n \n \n \n15.2 Bonds \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Discuss the basics of corporate bonds. \n2. Review the advantages and disadvantages to the corporation of issuing bonds. \n \n \nBasics of Corporate Bonds \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n634 \nCorporations often raise money through debt. This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration. There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Key financial advantages for a corporation when issuing bonds include the fact that bonds do not dilute ownership interests, thus maintaining the current ownership structure. Corporations also benefit from greater flexibility in issuing bonds with different durations, values, payment terms, and convertibility options. Bonds also allow companies to tap into a broader range of investors compared to stock offerings, which might be particularly attractive to risk-averse investors seeking lower-risk returns. Moreover, interest payments on bonds can be tax-deductible, reducing the overall cost of borrowing for the corporation. However, issuing bonds comes with significant drawbacks. Bonds represent a form of debt, meaning the corporation is obligated to make regular interest payments and repay the principal at maturity. If a corporation fails to meet these obligations, it risks bankruptcy, where bondholders have priority over equity holders in asset distribution. Additionally, being heavily indebted can be risky, as high interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing significantly, potentially leading to financial distress if the corporation struggles to generate sufficient cash flow to cover its debt obligations."

Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors. Ordinarily, a director \nmay be removed by a majority vote of the shareholders. Cumulative voting will not aid a given single \ndirector whose ouster is being sought because the majority obviously can win on a straight vote. So \nSection 8.08 provides, “If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of \nvotes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal.” \n \nVoting Arrangements to Concentrate Power \nShareholders use three types of arrangements to concentrate their power: proxies, voting agreements, and \nvoting trusts. \n \nProxies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n676 \nA proxy is the representative of the shareholder. A proxy may be a person who stands in for the \nshareholder or may be a written instrument by which the shareholder casts her votes before the \nshareholder meeting. Modern proxy voting allows shareholders to vote electronically through the \nInternet, such as at http://www.proxyvoting.com. Proxies are usually solicited by and given to \nmanagement, either to vote for proposals or people named in the proxy or to vote however the proxy \nholder wishes. Through the proxy device, management of large companies can maintain control over the \nelection of directors. Proxies must be signed by the shareholder and are valid for eleven months from the \ntime they are received by the corporation unless the proxy explicitly states otherwise. Management may \nuse reasonable corporate funds to solicit proxies if corporate policy issues are involved, but \nmisrepresentations in the solicitation can lead a court to nullify the proxies and to deny reimbursement \nfor the solicitation cost. Only the last proxy given by a particular shareholder can be counted. \n \nProxy solicitations are regulated by the SEC. For instance, SEC rules require companies subject to the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to file proxy materials with the SEC at least ten days before proxies are \nmailed to shareholders. Proxy statements must disclose all material facts, and companies must use a \nproxy form on which shareholders can indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the proposals. \n \nDissident groups opposed to management’s position are entitled to solicit their own proxies at their own \nexpense. The company must either furnish the dissidents with a list of all shareholders and addresses or \nmail the proxies at corporate expense. Since management usually prefers to keep the shareholder list \nprivate, dissidents can frequently count on the corporation to foot the mailing bill. \n \nVoting Agreements \nUnless they intend to commit fraud on a minority of stockholders, shareholders may agree in advance to \nvote in specific ways. Such a voting agreement, often called a shareholder agreement, is generally legal. \nShareholders may agree in advance, for example, to vote for specific directors; they can even agree to vote \nfor the dissolution of the corporation in the event that a predetermined contingency occurs. A voting \nagreement is easier to enter into than a voting trust (discussed next) and can be less expensive, since a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n677 \ntrustee is not paid to administer a voting agreement. A voting agreement also permits shareholders to \nretain their shares rather than turning the shares over to a trust, as would be required in a voting trust. \n \nVoting Trusts \nTo ensure that shareholder agreements will be honored, shareholders in most states can create \na voting trust. By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting",

                    "answer": "Cumulative voting ensures democratic representation among shareholders by allowing them to allocate their votes among the candidates for election. Specifically, if a shareholder owns a significant portion of the stock, they can cast all their votes for a single candidate, ensuring that their preferred candidate has a higher chance of being elected. This system allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock, for example, to elect 40 percent of the board, making the process more democratic and reflective of the ownership structure."

This strategy leverages the fact that management typically prefers to keep the shareholder list private, so dissident groups can count on the corporation to provide them with a list of all shareholders and their addresses. By collecting proxies from these shareholders, dissident groups can present a significant voting bloc that can influence the outcome of elections or other decisions, potentially overriding management's preferred candidates or proposals."

The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting. A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers.

What are the fiduciary duties required of a director? What measuring comparison is used to evaluate \nwhether a director is meeting these fiduciary duties? \n2. How would a staggered board prevent a hostile takeover? \n \n  \n \n[1] “Friction Triggers Iacocca Ouster,” Michigan Daily, July 15, 1978. \n \n \n \n16.4 Liability of Directors and Officers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Examine the fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers. \n2. Consider constituency statutes. \n3. Discuss modern trends in corporate compliance and fiduciary duties. \nNature of the Problem \nNot so long ago, boards of directors of large companies were quiescent bodies, virtual rubber stamps for \ntheir friends among management who put them there. By the late 1970s, with the general increase in the \nclimate of litigiousness, one out of every nine companies on the Fortune 500 list saw its directors or \nofficers hit with claims for violation of their legal responsibilities. [1] In a seminal case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court found that the directors of TransUnion were grossly negligent in accepting a buyout price \nof $55 per share without sufficient inquiry or advice on the adequacy of the price, a breach of their duty of \ncare owed to the shareholders. The directors were held liable for $23.5 million for this breach. [2] Thus \nserving as a director or an officer was never free of business risks. Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty. When there is a conflict between a director’s personal interest and the interest of the \ncorporation, he is legally bound to put the corporation’s interest above his own. This duty was mentioned \nin Exercise 3 of Section 16.2 \"Rights of Shareholders\" when Ted usurped a corporate opportunity and will \nbe discussed later in this section. \n \nFigure 16.3 Common Conflict Situations \n \n \n \nTwo situations commonly give rise to the director or officer’s duty of loyalty: (1) contracts with the \ncorporation and (2) corporate opportunity (see Figure 16.3 \"Common Conflict Situations\"). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n686 \nContracts with the Corporation \nThe law does not bar a director from contracting with the corporation he serves. However, unless the \ncontract or transaction is “fair to the corporation,” Sections 8.61, 8.62, and 8.63 of the Revised Model \nBusiness Corporation Act (RMBCA) impose on him a stringent duty of disclosure. In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the",

However, the act allowed shareholders a 'say on pay,' which means they now have the ability to vote on the compensation packages of the company's executives and directors. This provision aims to ensure that executive compensation aligns with the interests of shareholders and promotes transparency in corporate governance. Shareholders can use this right to voice their opinions and potentially influence the compensation structure, thereby enhancing accountability and fairness in the corporate decision-making process."

So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies. Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal. For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers. In particular, Title III contains corporate responsibility \nprovisions, such as requiring senior executives to vouch for the accuracy and completeness of their \ncorporation’s financial disclosures. While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in",

The Court also explicitly has defined a standard of materiality under the securities \nlaws, see TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438 (1976), concluding in the proxy-solicitation \ncontext that “[a]n omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n738 \nwould consider it important in deciding how to vote.”…We now expressly adopt the TSC Industries \nstandard of materiality for the 5 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context. \n \nThe application of this materiality standard to preliminary merger discussions is not self-evident. Where \nthe impact of the corporate development on the target’s fortune is certain and clear, the TSC Industries \nmateriality definition admits straight-forward application. Where, on the other hand, the event is \ncontingent or speculative in nature, it is difficult to ascertain whether the “reasonable investor” would \nhave considered the omitted information significant at the time. Merger negotiations, because of the ever-\npresent possibility that the contemplated transaction will not be effectuated, fall into the latter category. \n \n* * * \n \nEven before this Court’s decision in TSC Industries, the Second Circuit had explained the role of the \nmateriality requirement of Rule 10b-5, with respect to contingent or speculative information or events, in \na manner that gave that term meaning that is independent of the other provisions of the Rule. Under such \ncircumstances, materiality “will depend at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated \nprobability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of \nthe company activity.” SEC v.

Generally, \nin order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of \ninterest in the transactions at the highest corporate levels. Without attempting to catalog all such possible \nfactors, we note by way of example that board resolutions, instructions to investment bankers, and actual \nnegotiations between principals or their intermediaries may serve as indicia of interest. To assess the \nmagnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities allegedly manipulated, a factfinder will need to \nconsider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n739 \nvalue. No particular event or factor short of closing the transaction need to be either necessary or \nsufficient by itself to render merger discussions material. \n \nAs we clarify today, materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the \nwithheld or misrepresented information. The fact-specific inquiry we endorse here is consistent with the \napproach a number of courts have taken in assessing the materiality of merger negotiations. Because the \nstandard of materiality we have adopted differs from that used by both courts below, we remand the case \nfor reconsideration of the question whether a grant of summary judgment is appropriate on this record. \n \nWe turn to the question of reliance and the fraud on-the-market theory. Succinctly put: \n \nThe fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed \nsecurities market, the price of a company’s stock is determined by the available information \nregarding the company and its business.…Misleading statements will therefore defraud \npurchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.…The causal \nconnection between the defendants’ fraud and the plaintiff’s purchase of stock in such a case is no \nless significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d \n1154, 1160-1161 (CA3 1986). \n \n* * * \nWe agree that reliance is an element of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action.

Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes. A state may tax a foreign corporation as long as it does \nnot burden interstate commerce. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n759 \n \n1.

By the beginning of \nthe sixteenth century, the British common-law courts began to hear cases involving bills of exchange, but \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n779 \nit took a half century before the courts became comfortable with them and accepted them as crucial to the \ngrowing economy. \n \nCourts were also hesitant until the end of the seventeenth century about sanctioning a transferor’s \nassignment of a promissory note if it meant that the transferee would have better title than the transferor. \nOne reason for the courts’ reluctance to sanction assignments stemmed from the law that permitted \ndebtors to be jailed, a law that was not repealed until 1870. The buyer of goods might have been willing \noriginally to give a promissory note because he knew that a particular seller would not attempt to jail him \nfor default, but who could be sure that a transferee, probably a complete stranger, would be so charitable? \n \nThe inability to negotiate promissory notes prevented a banking system from fully developing. During the \nEnglish Civil War in the seventeenth century, merchants began to deposit cash with the goldsmiths, who \nlent it out at interest and issued the depositors promissory notes, the forerunner of bank notes. But a \njudicial decision in 1703 declared that promissory notes were not negotiable, whether they were made \npayable to the order of a specific person or to the bearer. Parliament responded the following year with \nthe Promissory Notes Act, which for the first time permitted an assignee to sue the note’s maker. \n \nThereafter the courts in both England and the United States began to shape the modern law of negotiable \ninstruments. By the late nineteenth century, Parliament had codified the law of negotiable instruments in \nEngland. Codification came later in the United States. In 1896, the National Conference of Commissioners \non Uniform State Laws proposed the Negotiable Instruments Act, which was adopted in all states by 1924. \nThat law eventually was superseded by the adoption of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code \n(UCC), which we study in these chapters. \n \nIn 1990, the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State \nLaws approved revised Article 3, entitled “Negotiable Instruments,” and related amendments in Article 4. \nThe revisions clarified and updated the law. All states except New York and North Carolina have adopted \nArticles 3 and 4. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n780 \nThe Future of Commercial Paper: Federal and International Preemption \nState law governing commercial paper is vulnerable to federal preemption. This preemption could take \ntwo major forms. First, the Federal Reserve Board governs the activities of Federal Reserve Banks. As a \nresult, Federal Reserve regulations provide important guidelines for the check collection process. Second, \nArticle 3 of the UCC can be preempted by federal statutes. An important example is the Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became effective in 1988 (discussed in Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"). \n \nFederal preemption may also become intertwined with international law. In 1988, the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Convention on International Bills of Exchange and International \nPromissory Notes. Progress on the treaty emanating from the convention has been slow, however: the \nUnited States, Canada, and Russia have approved the convention (in 1989 and 1990) but have not ratified \nthe treaty; Gabon, Guinea, Honduras, Liberia, and Mexico are the only countries to have ratified it. \n \nCommercial Paper in Economics and Finance \nEconomics \nTo the economist, one type of commercial paper—the bank check—is the primary component of M1, the \nbasic money supply. It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash. (A \nmore broadly defined money supply, M2, includes savings deposits at commercial banks.) \n \nFinance \nCommercial paper is defined more narrowly in finance than in law. To the corporate treasurer and other \nfinanciers, commercial paper ordinarily means short-term promissory notes sold by finance companies \nand large corporations for a fixed rate of interest. Maturity dates range from a low of three days to a high \nof nine months. It is an easy way for issuers to raise short-term money quickly. And although short-term \nnotes are unsecured, historically they have been almost as safe as obligations of the US government.

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it. A \nmere transferee stands in the transferor’s shoes and takes the instrument subject to all the claims and \ndefenses against paying it that burdened it when the transferor delivered it. Negotiation is a special type of \ntransfer—voluntary or involuntary—to a holder. A holder is a person who has an instrument drawn, issued, or \nindorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank. If the instrument is order paper, negotiation is \naccomplished by indorsement and delivery to the next holder; if it is bearer paper or blank paper, delivery \nalone accomplishes negotiation.

He does remain liable on the warranties, but only to the person who receives the paper, not to \nsubsequent transferees. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n819 \nBecause it is common practice for a depository bank (the bank into which a person makes a deposit) to \nreceive unindorsed checks under so-called lockbox agreements from customers who receive a high volume \nof checks, a customer who is a holder can deposit a check or other instrument for credit to his account \nwithout indorsement. Section 4-205(1) of the UCC provides that a “depositary bank becomes a holder…at \nthe time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder, whether or \nnot the customer indorses the item.” \n \nPartial Indorsement \nTo be effective as negotiation, an indorsement must convey the entire instrument. An indorsement that \npurports to convey only a portion of the sum still due amounts to a partial assignment. If Rackets’ agent \nsigns the check “Rackets, Inc.” together with the words “Pay half to City Water, /s/ Agent” and delivers \nthe check to City Water, that does not operate as an indorsement, and City Water becomes an assignee, \nnot a holder. \n \nBlank Indorsement \nA blank indorsement consists of the indorser’s signature alone (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of \nEndorsement\", left). A blank indorsement converts the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since \nthe indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—\nassuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A \npaper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it \ninto aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the \nindorsement. For example, a check indorsed by the payee (signed on the back) may be passed from one \nperson to another and cashed in by any of them. \n \nFigure 20.4 Forms of Endorsement \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n820 \nA blank indorsement creates conditional contract liability in the indorser: he is liable to pay if the paper is \ndishonored. The blank indorser also has warranty liability toward subsequent holders. \n \nSpecial Indorsement \nA special indorsement, sometimes known as an “indorsement in full,” names the transferee-holder. \nThe payee of a check can indorse it over to a third party by writing “Pay to the order of [name of the third \nparty]” and then signing his name (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", center). Once specially \nindorsed, the check (or other instrument) can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds \nhis own signature. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above \nthe signature of the indorser words of a contractual nature consistent with the character of the \ninstrument. \n \nSo, for example, Lorna Love’s check to Rackets, Inc., indorsed in blank (signed by its agent or stamped \nwith Rackets’ indorsement stamp—its name alone) and handed to City Water, is not very safe: it is bearer \npaper. If the check fell onto the floor, anybody could be a holder and cash it. It can easily be converted into \na check with special indorsement: City Water’s clerk need only add the words “Pay City Water” above \nRackets’ indorsement. (The magic words of negotiability—“pay to order of bearer”—are not required in an \nindorsement.) Before doing so, City Water could have negotiated it simply by giving it to someone (again, \na blank indorsement acts as bearer paper). After converting it to a special indorsement, City Water must \nindorse it in order to transfer it by negotiation to someone else. The liabilities of a special indorser are the \nsame as those of a blank indorser. \n \nThe dichotomy here of indorsement in blank or special indorsement is the indorser’s way of indicating \nhow the instrument can be subsequently negotiated: with or without further indorsing. \n \nRestrictive Indorsement \nA restrictive indorsement attempts to limit payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibit \nfurther transfer or negotiation. We say “attempts to limit” because a restrictive indorsement is generally \ninvalid. Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts.",

Wholesale transactions are the transfers of funds between businesses or \nfinancial institutions. \n \nBackground and Coverage \nIt was in the development of commercial “wholesale wire transfers” of money in the nineteeth and early \ntwentieth centuries that businesses developed the processes enabling the creation of today’s consumer \nelectronic funds transfers. Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A. Consistent with other UCC provisions, the rights and \nobligations under Article 4A may be varied by agreement of the parties.

Although the implication may be \notherwise, the rules in Article 4A apply to any funds transfer, not just electronic ones (i.e., transfers by \nmail are covered, too). Certainly, however, electronic transfers are most common, and—as the Preface to \nArticle 4A notes—a number of characteristics of them influenced the Code’s rules. These transactions are \ncharacterized by large amounts of money—multimillions of dollars; the parties are sophisticated \nbusinesses or financial institutions; funds transfers are completed in one day, they are highly efficient \nsubstitutes for paper delivery; they are usually low cost—a few dollars for the funds transfer charged by \nthe sender’s bank. \n \nOperation of Article 4A \nThe UCC “Prefatory Note” to Article 4A observes that “the funds transfer that is covered by Article 4A is \nnot a complex transaction.” To illustrate the operation of Article 4A, assume that Widgets International \nhas an account with First Bank. In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and",

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn. Although his order with the Lumber Company specifically provided for 4 x 6” runner boards, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n966 \nLumber Company used 2 x 6” boards. The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs. Baker testified that properly laminated two by six-inch boards are just as strong as \nfour by six-inch boards. \n \nMeade filed suit against the Bank in the trial court seeking $5,000 in damages.

However, Meade had already contacted the lumber company about his dissatisfaction and had the barn repaired, incurring additional costs. The bank's actions led to Meade incurring $3,800 in damages as a result of the improper payment. Meade filed suit against the bank in the trial court, and the court ruled in his favor, finding that the bank improperly paid the check. The bank's policy of treating stop payment orders received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday as being received the next business day, coupled with the failure to enter the stop payment order into the computer immediately, contributed to the improper payment."

That is, the Bank may \ntreat, for credit purposes, a woman who dresses like a man differently than a man who dresses like a \nwoman. If so, the Bank concedes, Rosa may have a claim.

The material facts \ndo not seem to be disputed. The parties agree that Ms. Rodgers gave birth to a daughter, Meghan, on May \n4, 2001. Meghan’s father is Raymond Anthony. Barbara McCullough, an attorney, represented Mr. \nAnthony in a child custody suit against Ms. Rodgers in which Mr. Anthony sought to obtain custody and \nchild support from Ms. Rodgers. Ms. McCullough received, reviewed, and used Ms. Rodgers’ consumer \nreport in connection with the child custody case. \n \nOn September 25, 2001, Ms. McCullough instructed Gloria Christian, her secretary, to obtain Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report. Ms. McCullough received the report on September 27 or 28 of 2001. She \nreviewed the report in preparation for her examination of Ms. Rodgers during a hearing to be held in \njuvenile court on October 23, 2001. She also used the report during the hearing, including attempting to \nmove the document into evidence and possibly handing it to the presiding judge. \n \nThe dispute in this case centers around whether Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms. Rodgers’ \nconsumer report for a purpose permitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”). Plaintiff \ncontends that Ms. McCullough, as well as her law firm, Wilkes, McCullough & Wagner, a partnership, and \nher partners, Calvin J. McCullough and John C. Wagner, are liable for the unlawful receipt and use of Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report in violation 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 o(negligent failure to comply with the FCRA) and \n1681n (willful failure to comply with the FCRA or obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses). \nPlaintiff has also sued Defendants for the state law tort of unlawful invasion of privacy.… \n \nAnalysis \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1010 \nPlaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the questions of whether Defendants failed to comply with \nthe FCRA (i.e. whether Defendants had a permissible purpose to obtain Ms. Rodgers’ credit report), \nwhether Defendants’ alleged failure to comply was willful, and whether Defendants’ actions constituted \nunlawful invasion of privacy.

            "chunk": "beginning of this chapter (personal property security, suretyship, real property security)—and a common \none. Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000. Bank says, “Okay, Mr. Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation \nmoney, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the \ndebt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no \nagreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety \nwithout the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1055 \nA guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, \ntherefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much \ninterchangeably. But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

The creditor can demand payment from the surety when the debt is due. On the other hand, a guarantor also guarantees an obligation of another, essentially being synonymous with a surety for practical purposes. However, technically, a surety usually signs the original agreement along with the principal debtor and is bound by the same contract, meaning they are aware of the principal debtor's potential default. Conversely, a guarantor typically enters into a separate agreement with the creditor, requiring different consideration. If the guarantor is not informed about the principal debtor's default, they can claim discharge to the extent that the creditor’s failure to inform prejudiced them. This distinction highlights the importance of understanding the specific terms of the agreement and the potential liabilities involved."

The classes of tangible goods are distinguished \nby the primary use intended. Under [the UCC] the four classes [include] “consumer goods,” “equipment,” \n“farm products” and “inventory.” \n \nThe difficulty is that the code provisions use terms arising in commercial circles which have different \nsemantical values from legal precedents. Does the fact that the purchaser bought the goods as a special \ngift to another person signify that it was not for his own “personal, family or household purposes”? The \ntrustee urges that these special facts control under the express provisions of the commercial code. \n \nBy a process of exclusion, a diamond engagement ring purchased for one’s fiancée is not “equipment” \nbought or used in business, “farm products” used in farming operations, or “inventory” held for sale, lease \nor service contracts. When the [debtor] purchased the ring, therefore, it could only have been “consumer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1064 \ngoods” bought “primarily for personal use.” There could be no judicial purpose to create a special class of \nproperty in derogation of the statutory principles. \n \nAnother problem is implicit, although not covered by the briefs. \n \nBy the foregoing summary analysis, it is apparent that the diamond ring, when the interest of the debtor \nattached, was consumer goods since it could have been no other class of goods. Unless the fiancée had a \nspecial status under the code provision protecting a bona fide buyer, without knowledge, for value, of \nconsumer goods, the failure to file a financing statement is not crucial. No evidence has been adduced \npertinent to the scienter question. \n \nIs a promise, as valid contractual consideration, included under the term “value”? In other words, was the \nring given to his betrothed in consideration of marriage (promise for a promise)? If so, and “value” has \nbeen given, the transferee is a “buyer” under traditional concepts. \nThe Uniform Commercial Code definition of “value”…very definitely covers a promise for a promise. The \ndefinition reads that “a person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them…generally in return for any \nconsideration sufficient to support a simple contract.” \n \nIt would seem unrealistic, nevertheless, to apply contract law concepts historically developed into the law \nof marriage relations in the context of new concepts developed for uniform commercial practices. They \nare not, in reality, the same juristic manifold. The purpose of uniformity of the code should not be \ndefeated by the obsessions of the code drafters to be all inclusive for secured creditors. \n \nEven if the trustee, in behalf of the unsecured creditors, would feel inclined to insert love, romance and \nmorals into commercial law, he is appearing in the wrong era, and possibly the wrong court. \n \nOrdered, that the Rike-Kumler Company holds a perfected security interest in the diamond engagement \nring, and the security interest attached to the proceeds realized from the sale of the goods by the trustee in \nbankruptcy. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1065 \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Plaintiff, a native \nSpanish speaker, negotiated the purchase with a Spanish-speaking salesperson at Webb. Plaintiff signed \nwhat he thought was a contract for the purchase and financing of the vehicle, with monthly installment \npayments to be made to Ford. The contract was in English. Some years later, plaintiff discovered the \ncontract was actually a lease, not a purchase agreement. Plaintiff brought suit against Ford and Webb on \nAugust 22, 2003, alleging fraud.

Understand the terminology used in mortgage transactions, and how mortgages are used as security \ndevices. \n2. Know a bit about the history of mortgages. \n3. Understand how the mortgage is created. \n \n \nHaving discussed in Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" security interests in personal \nproperty and suretyship—two of the three common types of consensual security arrangements—we turn \nnow to the third type of consensual security arrangement, the mortgage. We also discuss briefly various \nforms of nonconsensual liens (see Figure 26.1 \"Security Arrangements\"). \n \nFigure 26.1 Security Arrangements \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1080 \n \n \nDefinitions \nA mortgage is a means of securing a debt with real estate. A long time ago, the mortgage was considered \nan actual transfer of title, to become void if the debt was paid off. The modern view, held in most states, is \nthat the mortgage is but a lien, giving the holder, in the event of default, the right to sell the property and \nrepay the debt from the proceeds. The person giving the mortgage is the mortgagor, or borrower. In the \ntypical home purchase, that’s the buyer. The buyer needs to borrow to finance the purchase; in exchange \nfor the money with which to pay the seller, the buyer “takes out a mortgage” with, say, a bank. The lender \nis the mortgagee, the person or institution holding the mortgage, with the right to foreclose on the \nproperty if the debt is not timely paid. Although the law of real estate mortgages is different from the set \nof rules in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that we examined in Chapter 25 \"Secured \nTransactions and Suretyship\", the circumstances are the same, except that the security is real estate rather \nthan personal property (secured transactions) or the promise of another (suretyship). \n \nThe Uses of Mortgages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1081 \nMost frequently, we think of a mortgage as a device to fund a real estate purchase: for a homeowner to \nbuy her house, or for a commercial entity to buy real estate (e.g., an office building), or for a person to \npurchase farmland. But the value in real estate can be mortgaged for almost any purpose (a home equity \nloan): a person can take out a mortgage on land to fund a vacation. Indeed, during the period leading up \nto the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new \ncars, furniture, and so on. Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was \novervalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the \nmortgage payments. And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that \nthe debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater). They couldn’t \nsell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments. Some debtors just walked away, leaving",

The mortgagor, often the buyer in a home purchase scenario, is the borrower who pledges real estate as collateral for a loan. The mortgagee, typically a bank or financial institution, is the lender that provides the funds and holds the mortgage, which gives them the right to foreclose on the property if the debt is not repaid according to the terms of the mortgage."

Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note. [Citation.] \n \nChase may, therefore, recover the entire amount of the mortgage indebtedness, unless the court finds a \n“limited circumstance” upon which the request may be denied. [Citation.] Although not presented by \nChase in its discussion of this case, the Court may refuse foreclosure, notwithstanding that the defendant \nestablished a foreclosure action, if the acceleration was unconscionable and the “result would be \ninequitable and unjust.” This Court will analyze the inequitable result test and the limited circumstances \nby which the court may deny foreclosure. \n \nFirst, this Court does not find the mortgage acceleration unconscionable by assuming arguendo [for the \npurposes of argument] that the mortgage was valid during the period that the Satisfaction of Mortgage \nwas entered into the public records. Chase did not send the first acceleration warning until November 14, \n2000, the fourth month of non-payment, followed by the second acceleration letter on March 16, 2001, \nthe eighth month of non-payment. Although Cherry could have argued that a foreclosure action was an \n“inequitable” and “unjust” result after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered on his behalf, the result \ndoes not rise to an unconscionable level since Cherry could have properly tendered the mortgage \npayments to the court. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1102 \nSecond, the following “limited circumstances” will justify a court’s denial of foreclosure: 1) waiver of right \nto accelerate; 2) mortgagee estopped from asserting foreclosure because mortgagor reasonably assumed \nthe mortgagee would not foreclose; 3) mortgagee failed to perform a condition precedent for acceleration; \n4) payment made after default but prior to receiving intent to foreclose; or, 5) where there was intent to \nmake to make timely payment, and it was attempted, or steps taken to accomplish it, but nevertheless the \npayment was not made due to a misunderstanding or excusable neglect, coupled with some conduct of the \nmortgagee which in a measure contributed to the failure to pay when due or within the grace period. \n[Citations.] \n \nChase fails to address this fifth circumstance in its motion, an apparent obfuscation of the case law before \nthe court. This Court acknowledges that Cherry’s facts do not satisfy the first four limited circumstances. \nChase at no time advised Cherry that the acceleration right was being waived; nor is Chase estopped from \nasserting foreclosure on the mortgage because of the administrative error, and Cherry has not relied on \nthis error to his detriment; and since Chase sent the acceleration letter to Cherry and a request for \npayment to his attorney, there can be no argument that Cherry believed Chase would not foreclose. Chase \nhas performed all conditions precedent required by the mortgage provisions prior to notice of the \nacceleration; sending acceleration warnings on November 17, 2000, and March 16, 2001. Cherry also has \nno argument for lack of notice of intent to accelerate after default since he has not tendered a payment \nsince July 2000, thus placing him in default of the mortgage provisions, and he admits receiving the \nacceleration notices. \n \nThis Court finds, however, that this claim fails squarely into the final limited circumstance regarding \nintent to make timely payments. Significant factual issues exist as to the intent of Cherry to make or \nattempt to make timely mortgage payments to Chase. Cherry claims that he attempted to make the \npayments, but was told by a representative of Chase that there was no mortgage loan number upon which \nto apply the payments. As a result, the mortgage payments were placed into an account and later into his \ncounsel’s trust account as a mortgage escrow. Although these payments should have, at a minimum, been \nplaced with the court to ensure tender during the resolution of the mortgage dispute, Cherry did take \nsteps to accomplish timely mortgage payments. Although Cherry, through excusable neglect or a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1103 \nmisunderstanding as to what his rights were after the Satisfaction of Mortgage was entered, failed to \ntender the payments, Chase is also not without fault; its conduct in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage \ninto the Pinellas County public records directly contributed to Cherry’s failure to tender timely payments.",

Additionally, Chase contended that Cherry's failure to tender payments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court was more than just a technical breach of the mortgage and note.

He \ntestified the following language granted him the authority to perform the electrical upfit, so that \nhe was not required to submit the plans to BG Holding as required by a provision in the lease: \n“Lessor shall allow Lessee to put Office Trailer in Building. All Utilities necessary to handle \nLessee’s equipment shall be paid for by the Lessee including, but not limited to electricity, water, \nsewer, and gas.” (We note that BG Holding denies this interpretation, but insists it just requires \nthe Lessee to pay for all utility bills.) \n• \nPowder Coaters no longer occupies the property, and BG Holding possibly benefits from the work \ndone. \n \nIn the instant case, there is some evidence of consent. However, it does not rise to the level required under \nthe statute.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1110 \n \nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to F & D, whether BG Holding gave their consent is a \nclose question. However, we agree with the Court of Appeals, that F & D has not presented enough \nevidence to show: (1) BG Holding gave anything more than general consent to make improvements (as the \nlease could be interpreted to allow); or (2) BG Holding had anything more that “mere knowledge” that the \nwork was to be done. Powder Coaters asserted the lease’s addendum evidenced BG Holding’s consent to \nperform the modifications; however, there is no evidence BG Holding expressly or implicitly agreed that it \nmight be liable for the work. In fact, the lease between Powder Coaters and BG Holding expressly \nprovided Powder Coaters was responsible for any alterations made to the property. Even Powder Coaters \nacknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding.…Therefore, it is impossible to see how the very \ngeneral provision requiring Powder Coaters to pay for water, sewer, and gas can be interpreted to \nauthorize Powder Coaters to perform an electrical upgrade. Furthermore, we agree with the Court of \nAppeals that the mere presence of BG Holding’s agent at the work site is not enough to establish consent. \n \nConclusion \nWe hold consent, as required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute, is something more than mere knowledge \nwork will be or could be done on the property. The landlord/owner must do more than grant the tenant \ngeneral permission to make repairs or improvements to the leased premises. The landlord/owner or his \nagent must give either his tenant or the materialman express or implied consent acknowledging he may be \nheld liable for the work. \n \nThe Court of Appeals’ opinion is affirmed as modified. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Eventually, growth slows and unemployment rises. The\neconomy has moved from expansion to contraction when this occurs. The point at which the business cycle\nturns from expansion to contraction is known as the peak. The point at which the contraction ends and the\neconomy begins to expand again is known as the trough. The length of one business cycle is measured by the\ntime from one trough to the trough of the next cycle, as shown in Figure 3.15.\nFigure 3.15 Stages of the Business Cycle\nOften, the contraction is referred to as a recession.

            "chunk": "and when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\n102\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexpense recognition principle (also known as the matching principle).\nThe accrual method is considered to better match revenues and expenses and standardizes reporting\ninformation for comparability purposes. Having comparable information is important to external users of\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\nWho Uses Each Method?\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?",

                    "question": "What is the main difference between cash-basis and accrual-basis accounting, and why is accrual-basis accounting preferred?",
                    "answer": "The main difference between cash-basis and accrual-basis accounting lies in the timing of when transactions are recorded. In cash-basis accounting, transactions are recorded only when cash is exchanged, meaning that revenues are recognized when cash is received and expenses are recognized when cash is paid out. On the other hand, accrual-basis accounting records revenues and expenses in the period in which they are earned or incurred, regardless of when cash is actually received or paid. Accrual-basis accounting is generally preferred because it provides a more accurate picture of a company's financial position and performance, as it matches revenues and expenses to the periods in which they are incurred. This method is required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for most public companies and is also favored by banks for loan applications and by the Internal Revenue Service for tax reporting. Accrual accounting helps in making informed decisions by providing relevant and complete information to stakeholders and assists in improving business performance through analysis of financial data."

The syntax\nfor the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is\n=EFFECT(rate,periods)\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n251\nwhere rate is the nominal rate and periods represents the number of periods within a year.\nEarlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over\n19.56% (see Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7 Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate\nNote several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.\nExcel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization. We’ll revisit our 36-month auto loan for $32,000\nat 6% per year, compounded monthly. A loan amortization table for a fixed interest rate debt is usually\nformatted as follows, with the Interest and Principal columns interchangeable:\nPeriod\nPayment\nInterest\nPrincipal\nBalance\nIn Excel, a table is completed by using the function PMT. The individual steps follow.\n1.\nList the information about the loan in the upper left of the worksheet, and create the column headings for\nthe schedule of amortization. Type “B5” (without the quotation marks) in cell E9 to begin the schedule.\nThen enter 1 for the first month under the Payment # (or Month) column, in cell A10 (see Figure 8.8).\n252\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.8 Step 1 of Creating an Amortization Table\n2.\nNext, in cell B10, the payment is derived from the formula =PMT(rate,periods,pv), with PV representing the\npresent value, or the loan amount. Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate\nand periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The\ndollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t\nattempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as an absolute\nreference (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.9 Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table\n3.\nThe next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this\ncase cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference. The\nremaining balance of the loan should always be multiplied by this monthly percentage (see Figure 8.10).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n253\nFigure 8.10 Step 3 of Creating an Amortization Table\n4.\nBecause this is a fixed-rate loan, whatever is left from each payment after first deducting the interest\nrepresents principal, the amount by which the balance of the outstanding loan balance is reduced.\nTherefore, the contents of cell D10 represent B10, the total payment, minus C10, the interest portion (see\nFigure 8.11). No dollar signs are included because this cell reference can adjust to each row into which this\nformula is replicated, as will be seen in the following examples.\nFigure 8.11 Step 4 of Creating an Amortization Table\n5.\nBecause our principal portion of the last payment has reduced our outstanding balance, it is subtracted\nfrom the preceding balance in cell E9 (see Figure 8.12).

T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\n$75 billion.\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\n354\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\ndeposits.\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable. MMMFs provide smaller firms and investors the\nopportunity to participate in the money market by facilitating smaller individual investment amounts.\nFinancial Instrument Typical Maturity Minimum Amount\nIssuer\nTreasury bills\n4–52 weeks\n$10,000\nFederal government\nCommercial paper\n270 days\n$100,000\nBusinesses\nNegotiable CDs\n6 months\n$100,000\nFinancial institutions\nMMMFs\nInvestment companies\nFederal funds\n1 day\n$1 million\nFinancial institutions\nTable 12.1 Money Market Instrument Characteristics (Selected)\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets the equilibrium interest rate\non federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools.

In December 2020, the gross amount of new T-bills issued was $1,591.1 billion, while $1,570.6 billion of T-bills were retired, resulting in net new borrowing of $20.5 billion. This indicates that even when there is significant retirement of T-bills, the government still manages to maintain or slightly increase its overall borrowing through new issuances."

This figure\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\nmeasure risk with standard deviation.

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n513\nThe same issue with how much historical data should be considered arises when calculating a company’s beta.\nDifferent financial managers can calculate significantly different betas even for well-established, stable\ncompanies. In April 2021, for example, the beta for IBM was reported as 0.97 by MarketWatch and as 1.25 by\nYahoo! Finance.\nThe CAPM estimate of the cost of equity capital for IBM is significantly different depending on what source is\nused for the company’s beta and what value is used for the market risk premium. Using a market risk\npremium of 5%, the beta of 0.97 provided by MarketWatch, and a risk-free rate of 3% results in a cost of capital\nof\nIf, instead, a market risk premium of 8% and the beta of 1.25 provided by Yahoo! Finance are used, the cost of\ncapital is estimated to be\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating the Equity Cost of Capital\nAlthough the calculation of the cost of capital using the CAPM equation is simple and straightforward, there\nis not one definitive equity cost of capital for a company that all financial managers will agree on. Consider\nthe eight companies spotlighted in Table 17.3.\nFour estimates of the equity cost of capital are calculated for each firm. The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%. If you assume instead that the\naverage long-run return on the S&P 500 is 11%, then people who purchase a portfolio of those stocks are\nrewarded by earning 8 percentage points more than the 3% they would earn investing in the risk-free\nsecurity.\nThe last two estimates of the cost of equity capital for each company also use the same risk-free rate of 3%\nand the possible market risk premiums of 5% and 8%.

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the\nbalance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n539\nuse elements of the income statement to assess historical financial performance.

It’s critical that all members of the team take the time and effort to research their\ncustomers and the factors that impact their business in order to effectively assess the impact of these factors\non future sales. Though only two adjustments were made here, it’s likely that a large firm would have to\nconsider many, many factors that would ultimately impact monthly sales figures before arriving at a\nconclusion.\n18.3\nPro Forma Financials\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine pro forma in the context of a financial forecast.\n•\nDescribe the factors that impact the length of a financial forecast.\n•\nExplain the risks associated with a financial forecast.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will move beyond the sales forecast and look at the general nature, length,\nand timeline of forecasts and the risks associated with using them. We’ll look at why we use them, how long\nthey generally are, what the key variables in a forecast are, and how we pair those variables with common-size\nanalysis to develop the forecast.\nPurpose of a Forecast\nAs mentioned earlier in the chapter, forecasts serve different purposes depending on who is using them. Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth. Growing just for the sake of growing doesn’t always yield favorable income for\nthe firm. A larger top-line sales figure that results in lower net income doesn’t make sense in the grand\nscheme of things. The same is true of profitable sales that don’t generate enough cash flows at the right time.\nThe firm may make a profit, but if it doesn’t manage the timing of its cash flows, it could be forced to shut\ndown if it can’t cover the costs of payroll or keep the lights on. Forecasting helps assess both cash flow and the\nprofitability of future growth. Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial\nstatements; this allows them to identify potential gaps in cash and plan ahead in order to either alter collection\nand payment policies or obtain funding to cover the gap in the timing of cash flows.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPro Forma Financial Statements\nReview the video Business Plan and Pro-Forma Financial Statements (https://openstax.org/r/\nBusiness_Plan_and_Pro-Forma_Financial_Statements) to learn about the basics of pro forma financial\nstatements and why they are helpful.\n544\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLength of a Forecast\nForecasts can generally be for any length of time. The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements",

It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months.

Since forecasts already show a cash deficit of $13,000 at the end of the first quarter, the additional $30,000 expense from the ad campaign would significantly increase the need for funding. Moreover, Clear Lake must consider the increased operational costs alongside the advertising costs to determine if the campaign would be profitable.

Managing cash, accounts receivable, and\ninventory while making optimal use of trade credit (accounts payable) makes for a business that meets its\noperating needs and pays its debts when due.\nWorking capital management is also critical during good times. Even though profits might be rising, a business\nwith growing demand for its products and services still needs to have working capital management tools to\npay its bills. Growth in sales and profits do not immediately mean sufficient cash flow, so planning ahead with\ntools such as a cash budget is key.\nThe Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\n19\n19 • Why It Matters\n565\n19.1\nWhat Is Working Capital?\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine working capital.\n•\nCalculate a firm’s operating cycle and cash cycle.\n•\nCompute inventory days, accounts receivable days, and accounts payable days.\nThe concept of business capital is often associated with the cash and assets (such as land and equipment) that\nthe owners contributed to the business. Early political economists like Adam Smith and Karl Marx identified\nthis concept of capital, along with labor and entrepreneurship, to be the factors of production.\nThat general idea of capital is important and critical to a company’s productive capacity. This chapter is about\na specific type of capital— working capital—that is just as important as long-term capital. Working capital\ndescribes the resources that are needed to meet the daily, weekly, and monthly operating cash flow needs.\nEmployees are paid out of working capital as well as cash from operations, the fulfillment of merchandise\norders is possible because of working capital, and the liquidity of a company hinges upon how well\nmanagement plans and controls working capital.\nUnderstanding working capital begins with the concept of current assets—those resources of a business that\nare cash, near cash, or expected to be turned into cash within a year through the normal operations of the\nbusiness. Current assets are necessary for the everyday operation of the firm, and they are synonymous with\nterm gross working capital.\nCash is needed to pay the bills and meet the payroll. Excess cash is invested in cash alternatives such as\nmarketable securities, creating liquidity that can be tapped when operating cash flow needs exceed the\namount of cash on hand (checking account balances). Investment in inventory is necessary to meet the\ndemand for products (sales), and if the firm extends credit to its customers so that a sale can be made, the\nbalance sheet will also show accounts receivable—a very common current asset that derives its value from the\nprobability that customers will pay their bills.\nWorking capital is often spoken about in two versions: gross working capital and net working capital. As was\npreviously stated, gross working capital is equivalent to current assets, particularly those that are cash, cash-\nlike, or will be converted to cash within a short period of time (i.e., in less than one year).\nNet working capital (NWC) is a more refined concept of working capital. It is best understood by examining its\nformula:\nGoal of Working Capital Management\nThe goal of working capital management is to maintain adequate working capital to\n•\nmeet the operational needs of the company;\n•\nsatisfy obligations (current liabilities) as they come due; and\n•\nmaintain an optimal level of current assets such as cash (provides no return), accounts receivable, and\ninventory.\nWorking capital management encompasses all decisions involving a company’s current assets and current\nliabilities.

                    "question": "What are some key aspects of working capital management and how do they help a company maintain financial resilience?",
                    "answer": "Key aspects of working capital management include cash management, credit and receivables management, inventory management, and accounts payable management. Cash management involves ensuring there is enough cash to meet operational needs and obligations as they come due. Credit and receivables management focuses on managing accounts receivable to ensure timely payments from customers. Inventory management aims to maintain an optimal level of inventory to meet demand without tying up too much capital. Accounts payable management involves effectively using trade credit to finance current assets. Together, these components help a company run smoothly and mitigate the risk of illiquidity, ensuring it can meet its operational needs and pay its debts when due, thus maintaining financial resilience through various economic conditions."
