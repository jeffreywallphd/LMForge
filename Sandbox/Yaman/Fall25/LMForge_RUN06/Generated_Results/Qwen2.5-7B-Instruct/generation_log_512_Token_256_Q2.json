This situation can occur frequently, especially over the past fifty years, as seen in instances where the president's party does not hold a majority in the Senate. These conflicts stem from the differing priorities and ideologies of the two parties, leading to disagreements on judicial appointments and other legislative matters."

Additionally, while revolutions are rare, there are ongoing challenges to existing political-legal authorities, often driven by a desire for more democratic governance or greater citizen rights. This interplay between law and political power underscores the dynamic and sometimes contentious relationship between them in various national contexts."

To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states.

Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Firstly, the nature of the legal issue, such as whether the case involves federal law, diversity of citizenship among the parties, or a federal question, plays a significant role. If the case involves a federal statute or constitutional issue, it is more likely to be heard in federal court. Secondly, the amount in controversy, which refers to the monetary value of the claim, can also dictate the choice of court. In federal court, there is typically a higher threshold for the amount in controversy compared to state court. Lastly, the personal jurisdiction over the defendant is crucial, as the court must have the authority to hear the case against the specific defendant. This means that the defendant must have sufficient contacts with the state where the court is located, ensuring that the court's exercise of power is fair and just."

At the \nfirst level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has \none or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, \nTexas, and New York) have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges and fifteen \nmagistrates in this district. The district judges throughout the United States commonly preside over all \nfederal trials, both criminal and civil. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n87 \nCourts of Appeal \nCases from the district courts can then be appealed to the circuit courts of appeal, of which there are \nthirteen (Figure 3.1 \"The Federal Judicial Circuits\"). Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC.

For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with \nGoldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this \nagreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a \nMissouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims \nthat Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the \njudge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs. \n \nOrdinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause. In a choice-of-forum \nclause, the parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in the event of a dispute arising under \nthe terms of contract. For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from Alamo at the Denver \nInternational Airport. He does not look at the fine print on the contract. He also waives all collision and \nother insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental. While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass \nFestival, he has an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado.

Appellate judges focus on whether there were any legal errors made during the trial that might have influenced the outcome of the case. They do this by reviewing the briefs prepared by the parties' lawyers, which detail the facts of the case, the procedural steps taken, and arguments about the application of the law. Based on their review, the appellate court may affirm the lower court's decision, modify it, reverse it, or send it back for further proceedings.

But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional?

[1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918.

Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary).

The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware).

This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week.

Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce \nimposed by Iowa’s law. On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics.

Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v.

By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates.

The permanent staff, or the bureaucracy, is in charge of gathering facts and presenting data and arguments to the commissioners, who ultimately hold the power of the agencies. Most policy-making occurs at the staff level since these employees are in control of collecting information and presenting it to the commissioners."

By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president.

Informal rulemaking, which is the more common form, involves a less formal process where agencies announce their intention to create new rules, provide details about the proposed rules, and invite comments from the public. During this phase, agencies are not legally required to conduct a debate or hearing, although they often do so to gather input. Formal rulemaking, however, requires a more structured process, particularly when the enabling legislation mandates an 'agency hearing' after a thorough review. In formal rulemaking, agencies must hold an adversary hearing, allowing for a more adversarial and formal setting where stakeholders can present evidence and arguments against or in favor of the proposed rules. This process ensures that there is a more rigorous examination of the proposed regulations, with opportunities for cross-examination and legal representation."

Must one always stop at a red light? \nIs proof that the light was red always proof of negligence? Usually, but not always: negligence is an \nabstract concept that must always be applied to concrete and often widely varying sets of circumstances. \nWhether someone was or was not negligent is almost always a question of fact for a jury to decide.

How much \nknowledge must he have of events in the community, of technology, of cause and effect? With what \nphysical attributes, courage, or wisdom is this nonexistent person supposedly endowed? If the defendant \nis a person with specialized knowledge, like a doctor or an automobile designer, must the jury also treat \nthe “reasonable man” as having this knowledge, even though the average person in the community will \nnot?

One important rule goes by the Latin \nphrase res ipsa loquitur, meaning “the thing speaks for itself.” The best evidence is always the most \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n302 \ndirect evidence: an eyewitness account of the acts in question. But eyewitnesses are often unavailable, and \nin any event they frequently cannot testify directly to the reasonableness of someone’s conduct, which \ninevitably can only be inferred from the circumstances. \n \nIn many cases, therefore, circumstantial evidence (evidence that is indirect) will be the only evidence \nor will constitute the bulk of the evidence. Circumstantial evidence can often be quite telling: though no \none saw anyone leave the building, muddy footprints tracing a path along the sidewalk are fairly \nconclusive. Res ipsa loquitur is a rule of circumstantial evidence that permits the jury to draw an inference \nof negligence. A common statement of the rule is the following: “There must be reasonable evidence of \nnegligence but where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, \nand the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the \nmanagement use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the \ndefendants, that the accident arose from want of care.” [2] \n \nIf a barrel of flour rolls out of a factory window and hits someone, or a soda bottle explodes, or an airplane \ncrashes, courts in every state permit juries to conclude, in the absence of contrary explanations by the \ndefendants, that there was negligence. The plaintiff is not put to the impossible task of explaining",

                    "answer": "Res ipsa loquitur is a principle that allows for the inference of negligence when the accident is of a type that does not typically occur without negligence. Essentially, this means that if an incident occurs under the defendant's control, and the circumstances strongly suggest negligence, the plaintiff does not need to provide direct evidence of the defendant's negligence. Instead, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a reasonable explanation for the occurrence. This rule is particularly useful in cases where direct evidence is lacking or hard to obtain, such as in accidents involving machinery or products that are under the defendant's management."

In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law.

Why did the appeals court deny workers’ compensation benefits for Wolfe? \n2. On what reasoning did the New York high court reverse? \n3. There was a dissent in this case (not included here). Judge Breitel noted that the evidence was that Mrs. \nWolfe had a psychological condition such that her trauma “could never have occurred unless she, to begin \nwith, was extraordinarily vulnerable to severe shock at or away from her place of employment or one \nproduced by accident or injury to those close to her in employment or in her private life.” The judge \nworried that “one can easily call up a myriad of commonplace occupational pursuits where employees are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n411 \noften exposed to the misfortunes of others which may in the mentally unstable evoke precisely the \nsymptoms which this claimant suffered.” He concluded, “In an era marked by examples of overburdening of \nsocially desirable programs with resultant curtailment or destruction of such programs, a realistic \nassessment of impact of doctrine is imperative. An overburdening of the compensation system by \ninjudicious and open-ended expansion of compensation benefits, especially for costly, prolonged, and often \nonly ameliorative psychiatric care, cannot but threaten its soundness or that of the enterprises upon which \nit depends.” What is the concern here? \n \n \n \n \n9.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another. The law recognizes several types of agents, including (1) the \ngeneral agent, one who possesses authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name of and \non behalf of the principal; (2) the special agent, one with authority to act only in a specifically designated \ninstance or set of transactions; (3) the agent whose agency is coupled with an interest, one who has a \nproperty interest in addition to authority to act as an agent; (4) the subagent, one appointed by an agent \nwith authority to do so; and (5) the servant (“employee” in modern English), one whose physical conduct \nis subject to control of the principal. \n \nA servant should be distinguished from an independent contractor, whose work is not subject to the \ncontrol of the principal. The difference is important for purposes of taxation, workers’ compensation, and \nliability insurance.",

                    "answer": "The law governing the liability of principals for acts of their agents is well-established, but it often hinges on the specific facts of each case. In the context of sexual misconduct, courts generally apply a strict standard, as seen in the Cockrell case, where the Southern District of Mississippi and the Fifth Circuit, applying Mississippi law, have held that such misconduct falls outside the course and scope of employment. This means that even if an employee is authorized to perform certain duties, actions like 'smoking marijuana and engaging in sexual acts with minor boys' do not further the employer's interests and thus cannot be imputed to the employer. The determination of whether an action falls within the course and scope of employment is crucial because it directly impacts the principal's liability for the agent's actions. In the Cockrell case, once Officer James diverted from his official duties for personal reasons, his subsequent misconduct was deemed to be outside the scope of his employment, thereby absolving the city from liability for his actions."

Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners.

In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows.

The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups.

Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services.

The interactions of the decisions that businesses and customers make will determine the\nprice and quantity of a good or service that is sold in the marketplace. Financial managers need a strong\nfoundation in microeconomics. This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).",

Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States.

Employment expands as businesses produce more;\nconversely, unemployment falls. Other measures of economic growth may include increased new business\nstarts and new home construction. The economy is said to be “heating up.” As the expansion continues,\ninflation often becomes a concern.\n7\nData from US Bureau of Economic Analysis. “Gross Domestic Product (GDP).” FRED. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, accessed\nJuly 7, 2021. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP\n3.3 • Business Cycles and Economic Activity\n83\nFast-paced economic expansion is not sustainable. Eventually, growth slows and unemployment rises. The\neconomy has moved from expansion to contraction when this occurs. The point at which the business cycle\nturns from expansion to contraction is known as the peak. The point at which the contraction ends and the\neconomy begins to expand again is known as the trough. The length of one business cycle is measured by the\ntime from one trough to the trough of the next cycle, as shown in Figure 3.15.\nFigure 3.15 Stages of the Business Cycle\nOften, the contraction is referred to as a recession. A private think tank, the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (NBER), tracks the business cycle in the United States. The NBER is the entity that officially declares\nrecessions in the United States. Historically, a recession was defined as two consecutive quarters of declining\nGDP. Today, the NBER defines a recession in a broader, less precise manner; it will declare a recession when\nthere is a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts for at least a few\nmonths.8 Measures of real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale and retail sales are\nconsidered in addition to real GDP.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research was founded in 1920 to create measures of economic activity\nthat could be used in public policy discussions.

It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable?

We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance.

This is because the amount of remaining debt is higher in the early months, leading to a larger interest payment. As the loan progresses and the remaining balance decreases, the interest portion of the monthly payment decreases, while the principal repayment increases. Consequently, the lender receives more interest income in the initial months when the risk is higher, reflecting the compensation for the risk taken earlier in the loan period."

Money market securities are available in smaller amounts if you choose to invest\nin money market mutual funds (MMMFs) or certain types of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nTreasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, with maturities of 4, 8, 13, or 26 weeks. The Treasury also auctions 52-week T-bills once every four\nweeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities.\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills.

The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured.

In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms.

                    "answer": "Preferred stock stands out from common stock in several aspects of ownership, voting rights, and dividend payment. Firstly, preferred stockholders have a higher claim to cash flows compared to common stockholders, which means they receive dividends before common stockholders do and also have priority in the event of liquidation. This makes preferred stock more secure and less risky. Secondly, while preferred stock typically has fewer voting rights, it does offer some level of control, unlike common stock which grants one vote per share. Lastly, preferred stock dividends are usually fixed and paid after taxes, whereas common stock dividends are also post-tax but may not be guaranteed and can fluctuate based on the company's earnings. Additionally, preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends can be issued, and if the company misses a preferred dividend payment, it is considered in default. On the other hand, common stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation, meaning they own what remains after all other claims are satisfied. They have voting rights and can influence corporate decisions through their votes, typically one vote per share, and elect the board of directors."

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\ndetermined.\nKey Terms\narithmetic average return",

This can be done using Excel charting tools. Beta is calculated as the slope of the regression line that plots the stock's returns against the market's returns over a certain period. A higher beta indicates higher systematic risk, while a lower beta suggests lower systematic risk relative to the market."

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the\nbalance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to",

We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula",

To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement.

The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581",

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book",

Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate.
