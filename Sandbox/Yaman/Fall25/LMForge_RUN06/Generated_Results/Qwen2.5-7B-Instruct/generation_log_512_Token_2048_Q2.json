This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws.",

In studying law, we can most effectively learn by just looking at what the written \nlaw says, or by examining how it has been applied. In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination.

In \nEngland, judges began writing down the facts of a case and the reasons for their decision. They often \nresorted to deciding cases on the basis of prior written decisions. In relying on those prior decisions, the \njudge would reason that since a current case was pretty much like a prior case, it ought to be decided the \nsame way. This is essentially reasoning by analogy.

For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery.

This ruling aligns with the broader freedom of choice rationale, suggesting that employers have the autonomy to manage their workforce as they see fit. Conversely, if the court decides to make an exception to this general rule, it could rule that employers will face legal consequences for dismissing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the company during a court proceeding. This exception is grounded in the belief that maintaining the integrity of the judicial process and ensuring citizens fulfill their civic duties are paramount.

When courts justify their rulings with reasons such as 'freedom of choice' for the general rule or 'efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of citizenship' for the perjury exception, these explanations are often open to interpretation. Different individuals may find certain arguments more compelling than others, leading to varying levels of agreement or disagreement about the persuasiveness of the reasoning presented. This subjectivity means that while a court's decision may provide clarity in specific circumstances, it can also lead to ongoing debate and discussion about the broader implications and fairness of the ruling. Understanding the nuances of judicial reasoning is crucial for effectively analyzing and applying legal precedents, as it helps identify which aspects of a case are considered most significant by the court and which theoretical perspectives (or schools of legal thought) are most influential in shaping the decision."

Additionally, understanding the court's reasoning allows one to discern which facts were deemed most significant and which legal theories influenced the judges' decisions. Since judges may subscribe to different schools of legal thought, their differing perspectives often manifest in divided opinions, especially in appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court. Therefore, analyzing the court's reasoning is crucial for comprehending the nuances of legal arguments and the diversity of judicial interpretations."

                    "answer": "In the civil-law system, cases are typically decided by judges without a jury, and the decision-making process often involves three judges. Unlike common-law systems where judges are bound by precedents set by higher courts, civil-law systems do not strictly adhere to previous judicial decisions. Instead, the primary source of law is the codified statutes, and the interpretation of these laws can vary among individual judges. However, there is a doctrine known as 'jurisprudence constante' which means that if multiple courts interpret a specific provision in the same way, subsequent courts may feel compelled to follow that interpretation. The main driver of legal change in civil-law systems is the legislative body rather than the judiciary."

As we made clear in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. \nVinson, 477 U.S. 57 (1986), this language “is not limited to ‘economic’ or ‘tangible’ discrimination. \nThe phrase ‘terms, conditions, or privileges of employment’ evinces a congressional intent ‘to strike \nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women’ in employment,” which includes \nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.

Shareholders \nelect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. From this structure, some very basic \nrealities follow. Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany.

                    "answer": "The primary ethical challenges faced by corporate cultures revolve around the alignment of various stakeholders' interests and the potential conflicts that arise. One of the key challenges is the 'agency problem,' where the officers and top management hired by the board may prioritize their personal interests over those of the shareholders. This can lead to unethical practices such as insider trading, where a CEO might use inside information to benefit themselves at the expense of the company's shareholders. Additionally, board members might resist hostile takeovers, prioritizing their personal perks over the interests of stockholders. Another challenge is the misalignment of interests among different stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community, which can affect the corporation's ethical decision-making. For instance, a company might prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, leading to environmental degradation or exploitation of workers. These challenges impact decision-making by creating a complex web of interests and values that need to be balanced, often leading to difficult ethical dilemmas.

It posits that companies have a dual mission: to generate profit and to contribute positively to society. Conscious capitalism seeks to align corporate goals with the values and needs of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the environment. In contrast, stakeholder theory, developed by Milton Friedman and later expanded by others, suggests that companies should consider the interests of all stakeholders when making decisions, rather than focusing solely on shareholder value. While both approaches recognize the importance of considering multiple stakeholders, conscious capitalism goes further by advocating for a proactive and intentional integration of social and environmental goals into the business model. This means that companies must actively seek to create shared value, not just avoid harm. Conscious capitalism also emphasizes the role of leadership and culture in driving positive change, whereas stakeholder theory focuses more on the processes and mechanisms through which companies can balance diverse stakeholder interests. In practice, conscious capitalism encourages companies to adopt strategies that not only enhance financial performance but also contribute to broader societal benefits, fostering a more sustainable and equitable economy."

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners.

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na. What does Friedman mean by “ethical custom”? \nb. If the laws of the society are limiting the company’s profitability, would the company be within \nits rights to disobey the law? \nc. \nWhat if the law is “on the books,” but the company could count on a lack of enforcement from \nstate officials who were overworked and underpaid? Should the company limit its profits? \nSuppose that it could save money by discharging a pollutant into a nearby river, adversely \naffecting fish and, potentially, drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities. In \npolluting against laws that aren’t enforced, is it still acting “within the rules of the game”? What \nif almost all other companies in the industry were saving money by doing similar acts? \n2 \nConsider again the Harris v. Forklift case at the end of Chapter 1 \"Introduction to Law and Legal \nSystems\". The Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Harris was entitled to be heard again by the federal \ndistrict court, which means that there would be a trial on her claim that Mr. Hardy, owner of Forklift \nSystems, had created a “hostile working environment” for Ms. Harris. Apart from the legal aspects, \ndid he really do anything unethical? How can you tell? \na. Which of his actions, if any, were contrary to utilitarian thinking?",

                    "answer": "Milton Friedman suggests that 'ethical custom' refers to unwritten societal norms and expectations that guide business behavior beyond strict legal requirements. These customs are often related to maintaining a positive reputation and treating employees fairly, even when it may not be legally mandated. For example, a company might choose to provide fair wages and benefits to its employees, not just because it is required by law, but because it aligns with the broader ethical standards expected of businesses. While Friedman emphasizes that a company's primary responsibility is to maximize shareholder value, he acknowledges that adhering to ethical customs can enhance a company's long-term profitability by building trust and goodwill among customers, employees, and the community."

                    "answer": "If the laws of the society are limiting a company's profitability and state officials are overworked and underpaid, making enforcement unlikely, the company faces a complex ethical dilemma. On one hand, Friedman's perspective would argue that the company should operate within the framework of the law and avoid any actions that could be construed as illegal, regardless of enforcement. However, in practical terms, the company might need to consider the broader implications of its actions. By polluting against unenforced laws, the company might be engaging in activities that harm the environment and public health, which goes against utilitarian principles that prioritize the greatest good for the greatest number. Additionally, such actions could undermine public trust and lead to reputational damage, which could ultimately harm the company's long-term profitability and sustainability. Therefore, while the company must respect the letter of the law, it should also consider the spirit of ethical customs and the potential long-term consequences of its actions."

For example, if Mr. Hardy engaged in behavior that undermined the autonomy, dignity, or respect of female employees, this would violate Kantian principles. Kantian ethics would demand that employees be treated as ends in themselves and that their rights and dignity be respected at all times. Therefore, if Mr. Hardy's actions violated these fundamental principles, Kant would almost certainly disapprove, as they would not align with the categorical imperative to treat others as ends in themselves."

First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

Furthermore, state courts are bound by the full faith and credit clause to recognize the final judgments of courts in other states, preventing relitigation of the same disputes in different jurisdictions.

Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts.

Under this jurisdiction, a citizen of New Jersey could sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, whereas if both parties were from the same state, the suit would have to be filed in state court. The Constitution established this jurisdiction to prevent potential bias or discrimination by local courts against out-of-state parties. This was a concern during the early days of the United States, where it was believed that local courts might be less likely to fairly adjudicate disputes involving non-residents.

Appellate courts have several options: they can affirm the lower court's decision, modify it, reverse it, or reverse and remand the case back to the lower court for retrial.

In 2008, for instance, the Supreme Court received more than 7,000 petitions, yet it only heard arguments in 87 cases. This selective process is crucial because the court cannot possibly hear every case that comes before it. The court's decision to hear a case typically involves a review of the legal significance and the potential impact of the case on broader legal principles or constitutional issues."

For instance, in the case of Anna and Bobby, who collided in Roswell, New Mexico, despite living in Austin, Texas, the court in Austin would apply New Mexico's laws because that was the jurisdiction under which they were operating at the time of the accident. This is because New Mexico has specific regulations regarding motor vehicle laws and accidents, and applying its laws ensures consistency with the legal framework in effect at the time of the incident.

                    "answer": "When multiple individuals are injured in the same incident and wish to pursue a lawsuit together, several key considerations come into play. One significant factor is whether the injuries and damages are sufficiently similar to warrant a single lawsuit. If the injuries and damages are identical, a single lawsuit might be a more efficient method of determining liability and financial responsibility compared to numerous individual lawsuits. However, if the damages and injuries vary significantly, multiple lawsuits might be necessary to address the differences. Another critical aspect is the complexity of managing a large number of plaintiffs. With a group numbering more than a handful of people, it can become overwhelming to manage, as different facts might need to be proven at the trial for each individual. Additionally, the concept of class actions provides a legal procedure to allow one person or a small group of people to act as representatives for all others, which simplifies the process. Class actions are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and state-specific codes of civil procedure. These rules can be complex and vary among jurisdictions, but they generally permit anyone to file a class action in an appropriate case, subject to court approval. Once the class is certified, or deemed a legally adequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs effectively become lawyers for the entire class."

                    "answer": "The class action procedure facilitates legal representation for individuals who have suffered similar injuries or damages in a large-scale incident by allowing a single representative or a small group of representatives to act on behalf of the entire group. This is particularly useful when multiple individuals are injured in the same way and their injuries are identical, making a single lawsuit a more efficient way to determine liability and financial responsibility than numerous individual lawsuits. The class action is governed by specific legal rules, such as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and state-specific codes of civil procedure, which provide the framework for such proceedings. These rules ensure that the class is adequately represented and that the claims of all members are fairly considered. Once the class is certified, meaning the court has determined that it is a legally adequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs effectively become the lawyers for the entire class, streamlining the legal process and ensuring that all members of the class are represented appropriately."

These programs rely on the broad interpretation of the commerce clause to justify their existence and scope, and a more restrictive interpretation could limit their ability to function effectively on a national scale."

The court cited precedents allowing governmental intrusions into 'open fields,' leading to the ruling that the EPA's use of an aerial camera to photograph parts of the plant uncovered by roofs was permissible.

He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce.

In the context of border security, the Supreme Court has upheld certain searches and seizures as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, particularly when they are related to national security or border control. However, routine drug testing of border guards without individual suspicion or probable cause could be seen as an overreach of governmental power and an invasion of personal privacy. The Court might consider the balance between the government's interest in border security and the individual's right to privacy, potentially finding the policy unconstitutional if it is deemed to be an unreasonable search.

The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887.

By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates.

Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency.

Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers \nto an agency. In later decisions, it was made clear that Congress could delegate some of its legislative \npowers, but only if the delegation of authority was not overly broad. \n \nStill, some congressional enabling acts are very broad, such as the enabling legislation for the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is given the authority to make rules to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n212 \nprovide for safe and healthful working conditions in US workplaces.

                    "answer": "The requirement for individuals to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of an agency's order is a fundamental principle in the U.S. legal system. This requirement serves several important purposes. First, it allows the agency to correct any errors or misinterpretations of the law that may have occurred during the initial decision-making process. By giving the agency an opportunity to address these issues internally, the court can ensure that the case is thoroughly vetted and that all relevant facts and arguments are considered. Additionally, this process helps to conserve judicial resources by preventing premature litigation and ensuring that the most appropriate forum for resolving disputes is used. Finally, it promotes the separation of powers by allowing the executive branch to fulfill its role in administering the law before the judiciary becomes involved."

                    "answer": "One example of a successful lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act is Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15 (1953). In this case, the plaintiff, who was a victim of a chemical explosion, sought compensation from the federal government under the FTCA. The government initially argued sovereign immunity, but the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the government could be held liable for its negligence. This case highlights the importance of the Federal Tort Claims Act in allowing individuals to seek redress for injuries caused by the government's actions. Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that generally protects the government from being sued without its consent. However, the FTCA provides a specific exception to this rule, allowing certain claims against the government. While sovereign immunity may seem counterintuitive in some cases, it is often justified on the grounds of protecting the government's ability to function without constant legal challenges and to maintain a stable relationship with foreign governments. However, exceptions like the FTCA demonstrate that the balance between the government's immunity and individual rights can be adjusted when necessary."

By recognizing this distinction, the court allows for more stringent oversight and enforcement in these sectors without necessarily extending the same level of scrutiny to less hazardous industries, thus balancing the need for worker protection with the potential for overreach in less risky environments."

A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize.

Civil actions typically arise when a plaintiff seeks compensation or another form of remedy for harm suffered, such as a breach of contract or personal injury. In contrast, crimes involve 'the state'—which includes federal, state, or local governments—seeking to punish individuals who have caused harm to society, not just to specific individuals. The concept of 'harm to society' is crucial in defining crimes because it encompasses broader societal impacts beyond individual injuries. For instance, a fight between two friends at a party, though harmful to those directly involved, might not be considered a crime if it remains unknown to others. However, if a corporation publicly announces the closure of its operations, leading to significant job losses and economic disruption, this situation clearly represents 'harm to society' and could be prosecuted as a crime."

These statutes aim to provide clear notice to citizens about what constitutes a crime so that they can avoid committing offenses. To ensure fairness in government punishment, the U.S. Constitution prohibits ex post facto laws, which are laws that create punishments for acts that were legal at the time they occurred. Additionally, courts can strike down overly vague statutes under the 'void for vagueness' doctrine. This doctrine ensures that laws are precise enough to give people reasonable notice of what is expected of them and prevent arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.

The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to \ninstigate crime. The distinction is usually made between a person who intends to commit a crime and one \nwho does not. If the police provide the former with an opportunity to commit a criminal act—the sale of \ndrugs to an undercover agent, for example—there is no defense of entrapment. But if the police knock on \nthe door of one not known to be a drug user and persist in a demand that he purchase drugs from them, \nfinally overcoming his will to resist, a conviction for purchase and possession of drugs can be overturned \non the ground of entrapment. \n \nOther Excuses \nA number of other circumstances can limit or excuse criminal liability. These include compulsion (a gun \npointed at one’s head by a masked man who apparently is unafraid to use the weapon and who demands \nthat you help him rob a store), honest consent of the “victim” (the quarterback who is tackled), adherence \nto the requirements of legitimate public authority lawfully exercised (a policeman directs a towing \ncompany to remove a car parked in a tow-away zone), the proper exercise of domestic authority (a parent \nmay spank a child, within limits), and defense of self, others, property, and habitation. Each of these \nexcuses is a complex subject in itself. \n \n \nLack of Capacity \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n261 \nA further defense to criminal prosecution is the lack of mental capacity to commit the crime. Infants and \nchildren are considered incapable of committing a crime; under common law any child under the age of \nseven could not be prosecuted for any act. That age of incapacity varies from state to state and is now \nusually defined by statutes.

                    "answer": "The key distinction between entrapment and providing an opportunity for a criminal to act lies in the intent behind the actions of the police. When the police merely detect criminal activity without instigating it, there is no defense of entrapment. However, if the police actively engage in actions that compel or coerce an individual who was not initially inclined to commit a crime into doing so, this can be considered entrapment. For instance, if a police officer persistently demands that a non-drug user purchase drugs, eventually overcoming their resistance, this would likely be seen as entrapment. Conversely, if the police simply offer an opportunity to someone already predisposed to commit a crime, such as a drug dealer selling drugs to an undercover agent, there is no defense of entrapment."

Infants and children are generally considered incapable of committing crimes, with the specific age varying by jurisdiction, though it is typically defined by statute. Under common law, any child under the age of seven could not be prosecuted for any act. Beyond infancy, mental illness or disease can serve as a complete defense to criminal prosecution, provided the defendant can prove that they lacked the requisite mental state to form the necessary intent to commit the crime. Additionally, intoxication can sometimes be used as a defense, but it must be shown that the intoxication rendered the individual incapable of forming the intent to commit the crime. In summary, the law acknowledges that both age and mental state can mitigate criminal responsibility."

In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law.

Explain the Exclusionary rule and the reason for its existence. \n \n \nSearch and Seizure \nThe rights of those accused of a crime are spelled out in four of the ten constitutional amendments that \nmake up the Bill of Rights (Amendments Four, Five, Six, and Eight). For the most part, these \namendments have been held to apply to both the federal and the state governments. The Fourth \nAmendment says in part that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and \neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” Although there are numerous \nand tricky exceptions to the general rule, ordinarily the police may not break into a person’s house or \nconfiscate his papers or arrest him unless they have a warrant to do so. This means, for instance, that a \npoliceman cannot simply stop you on a street corner and ask to see what is in your pockets (a power the \npolice enjoy in many other countries), nor can your home be raided without probable cause to believe that \nyou have committed a crime. What if the police do search or seize unreasonably? \nThe courts have devised a remedy for the use at trial of the fruits of an unlawful search or seizure. \nEvidence that is unconstitutionally seized is excluded from the trial. This is the so-called exclusionary \nrule, first made applicable in federal cases in 1914 and brought home to the states in 1961. \nThe exclusionary rule is highly controversial, and there are numerous exceptions to it.

(The fruits of \na coerced confession are also excluded.) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n266 \n \nDouble Jeopardy \nThe Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from prosecuting a person twice for the same offense. \nThe amendment says that no person shall be “subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of \nlife or limb.” If a defendant is acquitted, the government may not appeal. If a defendant is convicted and \nhis conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime. \n \nSelf-Incrimination \nThe Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be \ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”). The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not \nfirst advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise \nhim during the questioning. [1] These so-called Miranda warnings have prompted scores of follow-up cases \nthat have made this branch of jurisprudence especially complex. \n \n \nSpeedy Trial \nThe Sixth Amendment tells the government that it must try defendants speedily. How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination",

Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states",

Negligence cases fall into the middle ground where the defendant's conduct is considered careless or poses an unreasonable risk of causing damage.

For a case to go to the jury, the \ncourts required that the mental distress result from some physical injury. In recent years, many courts \nhave overthrown the older rule and now recognize the so-called new tort.

The most difficult hurdle is proving \nthat the conduct was “extreme” or “outrageous.” \n \nIn an early California case, bill collectors came to the debtor’s home repeatedly and threatened the \ndebtor’s pregnant wife. Among other things, they claimed that the wife would have to deliver her child in \nprison. The wife miscarried and had emotional and physical complications. The court found that the \nbehavior of the collection company’s two agents was sufficiently outrageous to prove the tort of \nintentional infliction of emotional distress. In Roche v.

                    "answer": "In the context of tort law, particularly concerning situations where a person's intoxication leads to injury to others, the concept of vicarious liability comes into play. Vicarious liability refers to the legal principle where one party (often referred to as the 'principal') can be held responsible for the actions of another party (the 'agent'), even if the principal did not directly cause the harm. Specifically, when a bartender serves alcohol to an intoxicated individual who subsequently causes injury, the law may hold the bartender (the principal) strictly liable for the injuries caused by the drunk individual (the agent), regardless of whether the bartender was negligent in serving the alcohol. This is a form of strict liability rather than negligence, meaning the bartender can be held liable without needing to prove direct fault or negligence on their part."

This means that if someone causes harm while performing an inherently dangerous act, they can be held liable regardless of whether they were negligent or not. However, the application of strict liability to defective products has expanded more recently in the United States. While strict liability is not an absolute form of liability, it allows plaintiffs to sue manufacturers without proving negligence. Nevertheless, there are various defenses available to defendants, such as comparative negligence and product misuse, which can mitigate or negate the manufacturer's liability. This evolution reflects a shift towards holding manufacturers more accountable for the safety of their products while also recognizing the complexities and challenges in ensuring product safety."

Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages.

The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created.

According to the doctrine of strict liability, the party conducting the abnormally dangerous activity (in this case, the public display of fireworks) is held liable for any resulting damages, irrespective of the actions or negligence of third parties, such as the manufacturer. Even though the Chinese manufacturer's negligence contributed to the accident, it does not absolve Pyrodyne of liability. The court explicitly rejected Pyrodyne's argument that the Chinese manufacturer's negligence could relieve it from strict liability. Therefore, Klein can pursue both the Chinese manufacturer and Pyrodyne for his injuries, as the strict liability doctrine aims to provide comprehensive protection to those harmed by abnormally dangerous activities, ensuring that they have recourse to multiple parties who may be responsible for their injuries."

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

This differs from negligence, where the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions were careless or unreasonable. In strict liability cases, the focus is on the defective nature of the product itself rather than the conduct of the manufacturer or seller. This shift in burden can provide a more straightforward path for injured parties to seek compensation without having to establish fault or negligence on the part of the manufacturer or seller."

                    "answer": "Yes, the defendants would likely be liable for injuries caused to someone who stepped on the rotting floor without warning, as their failure to maintain the property in a safe condition constitutes negligence. The status of the visitor significantly affects liability. If the visitor is an invitee, the defendants owe a higher duty of care and would likely be held fully liable. If the visitor is a licensee or a mere trespasser, the defendants may still be liable, but the extent of their liability could be reduced based on the foreseeability of harm and the reasonableness of their actions to prevent injury. The lack of warning to the visitor about the dangerous condition further supports the defendants' liability."

Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932. A",

Lastly, the law of contracts serves as a learning tool, alerting parties to potential issues that have arisen in previous transactions, allowing them to make more informed decisions and avoid pitfalls. These functions collectively enhance the efficiency and predictability of commercial activities."

The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v.

Sales law is a specialized branch of contract law that applies only to transactions involving the sale of goods, as defined in Section 2-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). According to this definition, goods are 'all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in which the price is to be paid.'

                    "answer": "Courts often face challenges in determining whether a contract involves the sale of goods or services, especially in product liability cases where buyers seek damages due to defects. In these scenarios, the courts must decide if the goods and services can be properly separated. For instance, in a case where a customer experiences a severe scalp rash from a permanent hair treatment, the question becomes whether the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods. The courts' approach varies; some may rule that no sale of goods occurred if the goods were only incidentally used during the service (as seen in Epstein v. Giannattasio). Conversely, other courts might hold that if the goods were intended for home use (as in Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc.), an implied warranty of fitness for that purpose would apply, even if the goods were applied during the service. This split in judicial interpretation underscores the complexity of these cases and highlights the importance of clear contractual terms and definitions to avoid ambiguity."

(A convention is a preliminary agreement that serves as the basis for a \nformal treaty.) The Convention has been adopted by several countries, including the United States. \n \nThe Convention is significant for three reasons. First, the Convention is a uniform law governing the sale \nof goods—in effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code. The major goal of the drafters was to \nproduce a uniform law acceptable to countries with different legal, social and economic systems. Second, \nalthough provisions in the Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are significant \ndifferences. For instance, under the Convention, consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a \ncontract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that some contracts be evidenced by a writing to \nbe enforceable—also discussed below). Finally, the Convention represents the first attempt by the US \nSenate to reform the private law of business through its treaty powers, for the Convention preempts the \nUCC if the parties to a contract elect to use the CISG. \n \nBasic Contract Taxonomy \nContracts are not all cut from the same die. Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement.

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES",

This rule applies when the offeror does not specify a particular mode of acceptance, or if the customary method of communication in the industry is used. The rule is rooted in the historical practice of using the postal service, which has been a common and reliable method of communication for centuries. The rule dates back nearly two hundred years to the English courts, where it was first established. It provides a clear and consistent standard for determining when an acceptance is effective, thereby minimizing disputes over the timing of acceptance and ensuring that contracts are formed as intended. The rule reflects the legal recognition of the moment when a communication is sufficiently dispatched to be considered effective, aligning with the principle that a reasonable person would expect a contract to be formed once the acceptance is properly communicated."

The willingness of state courts to uphold punitive damage awards, especially in cases involving insurance companies' refusal to honor their contracts, highlights another factor. In these situations, courts often take into account the conduct of the company’s agents or employees, as well as the company's history of similar incidents. Additionally, the context of the case, such as whether the defendant engaged in tortious conduct, also influences the award."

                    "answer": "A court may issue an order of specific performance in a contract dispute under specific circumstances. For instance, when one party breaches a contract to sell a unique item, such as real estate or a specific antique like a gold samovar mentioned in the example, the aggrieved party can seek specific performance as a remedy. This remedy is particularly attractive when monetary damages are inadequate or insufficient to compensate for the loss. In the case of Emily and Charlotte, where Emily repudiates the contract to sell the gold samovar, a court would likely grant Charlotte an order of specific performance. However, it is important to note that specific performance is only available for the sale of unique items. For non-unique items, monetary damages would generally be the preferred remedy."

These relationships can be summed up in a simple \ndiagram (see Figure 9.1 \"Agency Relationships\"). \n \nFigure 9.1 Agency Relationships \n \n \nIn this chapter, we will consider the principal-agent side of the triangle. In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

They can significantly impact the principal's legal relationships with third parties due to their broad mandate. However, the principal must clearly define any specific limitations to avoid liability for actions taken beyond the granted authority.

For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

This means that the agent's powers are limited to performing specific tasks as defined by the principal. In the case of Alberta, who was appointed by Sam to find a buyer for his property, her commission was contingent upon the selling price being no less than $150,000. If Alberta located a buyer, Bob, who agreed to purchase the property for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale would not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta had authority only to find a buyer; she did not have the authority to sign the contract.

                    "answer": "An agency coupled with an interest occurs when an agent's reimbursement depends on maintaining the authority to act as an agent, particularly when the agent has a property interest in the business. In the context of a literary agent, this arrangement ensures that the agent's commission is tied to the success of the literary work. By agreeing that the agency is coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent their rights in a particular literary work from being terminated to their detriment. This is beneficial for authors because it provides them with a more secure financial arrangement. For instance, if an author enters into such an agreement, the literary agent can continue to act as a collection agent to ensure that the author receives all due payments from the sale of the work, thereby safeguarding the author's earnings and the agent's commission. This type of arrangement fosters a more stable and reliable relationship between the author and the literary agent."

                    "answer": "The distinction between an employee and an independent contractor lies primarily in the level of control exerted over the individual's work and the nature of the relationship. An employee is subject to specific direction and control by the employer regarding how, when, and where the work is performed. In contrast, an independent contractor has significant autonomy and is responsible for managing their own work. Employees typically receive benefits, have taxes withheld, and are covered by workers' compensation laws, whereas independent contractors are not entitled to these benefits and are responsible for their own taxes. Employers may misclassify employees as independent contractors to avoid liability for payroll taxes, workers' compensation, and other employment-related expenses, leading to complex legal disputes."

The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose.

The cost of purchasing insurance depends on the number and seriousness of claims made, which are influenced by the level of risk associated with the type of work being performed. For instance, industries considered more hazardous, such as shake and shingle mills or asphalt paving, would incur higher insurance costs compared to less risky sectors like lawn care maintenance or supermarkets.

                    "answer": "A prudent driver would likely hesitate to entrust their car to a stranger in a uniform without knowing if the person has authorization from the restaurant due to concerns about liability and trust. The text suggests that without a disclaimer indicating the lack of parking facilities or warning drivers about the risks of entrusting their car to an unauthorized individual, a driver might assume that the person in the uniform is authorized and connected to the restaurant. This assumption is based on the knowledge that restaurateurs typically present the appearance of providing the convenience of free parking and doorman services to attract customers. Additionally, the text implies that drivers might be wary of dealing with an independent operator who may have questionable financial responsibility, making them more cautious about leaving their vehicle unattended."

Microsoft Corp. \n97 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. 1996) \n \nReinhardt, J. \n \nLarge corporations have increasingly adopted the practice of hiring temporary employees or \nindependent contractors as a means of avoiding payment of employee benefits, and thereby increasing \ntheir profits. This practice has understandably led to a number of problems, legal and otherwise. One of \nthe legal issues that sometimes arises is exemplified by this lawsuit. The named plaintiffs, who were \nclassified by Microsoft as independent contractors, seek to strip that label of its protective covering and \nto obtain for themselves certain benefits that the company provided to all of its regular or permanent \nemployees. After certifying the named plaintiffs as representatives of a class of “common-law \nemployees,” the district court granted summary judgment to Microsoft on all counts. The \nplaintiffs…now appeal as to two of their claims: a) the claim…that they are entitled to savings benefits \nunder Microsoft’s Savings Plus Plan (SPP); and b) that…they are entitled to stock-option benefits under \nMicrosoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

The court, however, rejected this argument, stating that the key factor in determining employment status is the degree of control and direction exerted over the worker, not the relationship between the worker and the entity that hired them. Thus, the court found that the similarities between the two cases were sufficient to support the conclusion that the car-parking attendant in this case was also an employee."

What the third party knows about the agency agreement is irrelevant to the agent’s legal \nauthority to act. That authority runs from principal to agent. As long as an agent has authorization, either \nexpress or implied, she may bind the principal legally. Thus the seller of a house may be ignorant of the \nbuyer’s true identity; the person he supposes to be the prospective purchaser might be the agent of an \nundisclosed principal. Nevertheless, if the agent is authorized to make the purchase, the seller’s ignorance \nis not a ground for either seller or principal to void the deal. \nBut if a person has no authority to act as an agent, or an agent has no authority to act in a particular way, \nis the principal free from all consequences? The answer depends on whether or not the agent \nhas apparent authority—that is, on whether or not the third person reasonably believes from the \nprincipal’s words, written or spoken, or from his conduct that he has in fact consented to the agent’s \nactions. Apparent authority is a manifestation of authority communicated to the third person; it runs from \nprincipal to third party, not to the agent. \n \nApparent authority is sometimes said to be based on the principle of estoppel.

By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less).

For instance, in cases involving the use of automobiles, if a personal friend borrows a car without permission and causes harm, the owner might be held liable depending on the state's laws. Two common approaches are legislative owner's consent statutes and the family purpose doctrine. The latter holds the owner responsible if a family member uses the car for family purposes, even if the owner had forbidden it, as long as the use aligns with the family's interests.

This distinction is crucial because the legal principle of respondeat superior applies only to acts committed within the scope of employment, and the court must carefully consider the nature and timing of the assaults to determine liability."

Identify the entity characteristics of partnerships. \n \n \nImportance of Partnership Law \nIt would be difficult to conceive of a complex society that did not operate its businesses through \norganizations. In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership. There are also limited partnerships \nand limited liability partnerships, which are discussed in Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nTable 11.1 Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and Limited Liability \nCompanies \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nTotal number of active partnerships \n2,375,375 \n2,546,877 \n2,763,625 \n2,947,116 \nNumber of partners \n14,108,458 15,556,553 16,211,908 16,727,803 \nNumber of limited partnerships \n378,921 \n402,238 \n413,712 \n432,550 \nNumber of partners \n6,262,103 \n7,023,921 \n6,946,986 \n6,738,737 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n458 \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nNumber of limited liability companies 1,091,502 \n1,270,236 \n1,465,223 \n1,630,161 \nNumber of partners \n4,226,099 \n4,949,808",

This legal definition encompasses various types of business arrangements where multiple individuals collaborate to run a profitable venture. Common professions that often choose to form partnerships in the United States include accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. These individuals frequently opt for partnerships due to the mutual benefits such as shared financial risks, pooled resources, and the ability to attract clients or customers more effectively through collective expertise."

This means that unless partners explicitly agree to different terms in their partnership agreement, the provisions of these acts will apply to their business arrangement. UPA (or RUPA) is particularly important for partnerships that are formed without a written agreement or where the agreement is vague or incomplete, as these acts provide a comprehensive framework for the operation and management of such partnerships."

                    "answer": "There are two primary theories of partnership: the aggregate theory and the entity theory. The aggregate theory views a partnership as a collection of individual assets and liabilities owned by the partners. According to this theory, the partnership itself has no distinct legal identity separate from its partners, and each partner is personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. On the other hand, the entity theory holds that a partnership is a distinct legal entity with its own rights and responsibilities, separate from those of the individual partners. Under this theory, the partnership can enter into contracts and hold property in its own name, and the partners' liability is generally limited to their capital contributions to the partnership. These differing perspectives have implications for how partnerships are structured, managed, and held accountable for their actions."

Understand partnership by estoppel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n464 \n \nCreation of an Express Partnership \nCreation in General \nThe most common way of forming a partnership is expressly—that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a \npartnership is called an express partnership. If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership. Able contributes \n$250,000. Baker contributes the building and space in which the business will operate. Carr contributes \nhis services; he will manage the dealership. \n \nThe first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have a partnership agreement. As should be clear \nfrom the foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the tests of partnership are met. \nHowever, they ought to have an agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among themselves. \n \nThe agreement itself is a contract and should follow the principles and rules spelled out in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" of this book. Because it is intended to govern the relations of the partners toward themselves \nand their business, every partnership contract should set forth clearly the following terms: (1) the name \nunder which the partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3) the nature, scope, and \nlocation of the business; (4) the capital contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to be \ndivided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7) the responsibilities of each partner for \nmanaging the business; (8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm; (9) the method by \nwhich a given partner may withdraw from the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event of a \npartner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs; and (11) method of \ndissolution. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n465 \nSpecific Issues of Concern \nIn forming a partnership, three of these items merit special attention.

First, it's important to define who can be a partner, as this will determine the composition of the partnership. Second, the method by which a given partner may withdraw from the partnership needs to be established to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth operations. Third, the continuation of the firm in the event of a partner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs must be addressed to protect the continuity of the business and the interests of the remaining partners and the deceased partner’s heirs. These matters are crucial because if not provided for in the agreement, the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) will default to these provisions, which might not align with the partners' intentions or wishes."

Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition. Under these circumstances, when there simply was no \nindication that Loomis and Shanahan represented that they were conducting business as the 52 Cattle \nCompany and no reliance by Whitehead that he was doing business with the 52 Cattle Company, NRS \n602.070 does not bar the suit against Whitehead. \n \nWe therefore reverse the district court’s partial summary judgment in this instance and remand for trial",

                    "answer": "Cardozo's description of the duty of care under RUPA Section 404(c) entails that the duty of care is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. This means that while a partner must not engage in such behaviors, minor negligence does not necessarily constitute a breach of duty. For instance, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not well-versed in the firm’s computerized bookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and inadvertently erases a month’s worth of records. Despite her negligence, she did not breach her duty of care because her actions were not grossly negligent under RUPA Section 404(c). This example illustrates that a partner can perform their duties loyally yet negligently without necessarily breaching their duty of care."

                    "answer": "The duty of obedience in a partnership is rooted in the contractual relationship among partners, where each partner is both an agent and principal of the others. This duty obligates partners to adhere to the partnership agreement and follow any properly made partnership decisions. It encompasses the responsibility to act within the authority expressly or impliedly granted in the partnership agreement. Furthermore, a partner is accountable to the other partners for any damages or losses resulting from unauthorized activities. This means that partners must operate within the boundaries set by the partnership agreement, ensuring that all actions taken are consistent with the agreed-upon terms and conditions. Any deviation from these terms could lead to liability for the partner who acted outside their authorized scope."

When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others.

However, as to other grants or limitations of authority, “only a third party who knows or \nhas received a notification of a partner’s lack of authority in an ordinary course transaction is bound.” [4] \n \nSince RUPA is mostly intended to provide the rules for the small, unsophisticated partnership, it is \nquestionable whether these arcane “statements” are very often employed. \n \nPersonal Liability of Partners, in General \nIt is clear that the partnership is liable for contracts by authorized partners, as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs. The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner.

[6] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n508 \nUnder UPA, contract liability is joint only, not also several. This means the partners must be sued in a \njoint action brought against them all. A partner who is not named cannot later be sued by a creditor in a \nseparate proceeding, though the ones who were named could see a proportionate contribution from the \nones who were not. \n \nLiability of Incoming Partners \nUnder RUPA Section 306(b), a new partner has no personal liability to existing creditors of the \npartnership, and only her capital investment in the firm is at risk for the satisfaction of existing \npartnership debts.

If the partnership agreement does not specify the method of distribution, state laws, such as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), generally dictate how assets are divided. In cases where the partnership is dissolved due to illegality or substantial changes in the business, creditors may seek to recover their losses from the liquidated assets. For example, if a creditor obtains a charging order against a partner, and the firm's obligations cannot be met, a court might order dissolution to allow the creditor to be paid from the firm's liquidated assets. This process ensures that partners are held responsible for their share of the partnership's liabilities, and assets are distributed fairly among them.

                    "answer": "In a limited liability company (LLC), general partners are held liable as a partner would be in a general partnership, meaning they could face personal liability for the company’s debts and obligations. In contrast, limited partners enjoy limited liability protection, which means their personal assets are generally protected from claims against the company, except in cases where they engage in active management of the firm and thereby become de facto general partners. This transition to a general partner status would expose them to unlimited liability similar to that of a general partner. Limited partners can leave the company with only six months' notice and are entitled to receive a proportional payout based on their investment. However, if a limited partner exercises significant control over the company, their liability may extend beyond the loss of their investment, potentially making them personally responsible for the company’s debts and obligations. This dual nature of LLCs—offering the flexibility of partnerships and the liability protection of corporations—makes them an attractive option for investors seeking both control and protection."

A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary.

But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks.

Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies.

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

Prior to the Revolution, the number of business corporations in the thirteen colonies was very small, with perhaps fewer than a dozen existing. However, this changed dramatically during the 1790s when two hundred businesses were incorporated, and the trend continued to grow thereafter.

Many states began allowing incorporation by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. By the late nineteenth century, all but three states constitutionally prohibited their legislatures from chartering companies through special enactments.

Creating a corporation is more complicated because formal documents \nmust be placed on file with public authorities. \n \nOwnership and Control \nAll general partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the business. By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over \ncorporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the \nofficers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control \nmay be less pronounced or even nonexistent. \n \nTransferability of Interests \nTransferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member \nunless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership \nagreement.

This contrasts sharply with corporations where ownership and control are theoretically separated. In publicly held corporations, due to the widespread distribution of ownership among millions of shareholders, this separation is practically realized since it is uncommon for any single shareholder to own more than a tiny fraction of the company's stock. Consequently, it becomes challenging for shareholders to exert control over corporate operations. However, in closely held corporations, where the number of shareholders is limited, the officers or senior managers who often hold significant shares may also manage the company, leading to a lesser or virtually non-existent separation between ownership and control."

This process can be mitigated through detailed partnership agreements. Conversely, transferring shares in a corporation is generally simpler and can be achieved through the sale of stock to the public or privately. For small corporations, however, the ease of transferability may be compromised due to the lack of a robust secondary market for their stock, or there could be contractual restrictions that limit the ability to sell shares. Therefore, while partnerships require explicit consent for changes in membership, corporations offer more straightforward mechanisms for altering ownership through share transactions."

One of the primary considerations is the legal framework and tax policies of the state. Delaware remains the state of choice for incorporation, especially for publicly held companies, due to its well-established corporate law, business-friendly environment, and extensive case law that provides clear guidance on corporate governance issues.

Their responsibilities include entering into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, which can expose them to personal liability if the corporation fails to fulfill its obligations. Promoters also prepare the articles of incorporation, which must include the corporation's name and purpose. While these duties are essential, they come with significant risks. For instance, if a promoter signs a contract without proper authority or misrepresents the corporation's intentions, they could face personal legal action. To mitigate these risks, promoters can seek legal advice, ensure they have the necessary authority, and clearly define the corporation's objectives in the articles of incorporation to avoid misunderstandings or misrepresentations."

In appellants’ \nview, the enactment of a graduated personal income tax, as proposed to be authorized by constitutional \namendment, would have a seriously adverse effect on the economy of the State. The importance of the \nreferendum issue to the people and government of Massachusetts is not disputed. Its merits, however, are \nthe subject of sharp disagreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n613 \n \nWe thus find no support in the First or Fourteenth Amendment, or in the decisions of this Court, for the \nproposition that speech that otherwise would be within the protection of the First Amendment loses that \nprotection simply because its source is a corporation that cannot prove, to the satisfaction of a court, a \nmaterial effect on its business or property. The “materially affecting” requirement is not an identification \nof the boundaries of corporate speech etched by the Constitution itself. Rather, it amounts to an \nimpermissible legislative prohibition of speech based on the identity of the interests that spokesmen may \nrepresent in public debate over controversial issues and a requirement that the speaker have a sufficiently \ngreat interest in the subject to justify communication. \n \nSection 8 permits a corporation to communicate to the public its views on certain referendum subjects—\nthose materially affecting its business—but not others. It also singles out one kind of ballot question—\nindividual taxation as a subject about which corporations may never make their ideas public. The \nlegislature has drawn the line between permissible and impermissible speech according to whether there \nis a sufficient nexus, as defined by the legislature, between the issue presented to the voters and the \nbusiness interests of the speaker. \n \nIn the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating the subjects \nabout which persons may speak and the speakers who may address a public issue. If a legislature may \ndirect business corporations to “stick to business,” it also may limit other corporations—religious, \ncharitable, or civic—to their respective “business” when addressing the public.

This is covered \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual \nLiens\". A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration.

Plaintiffs assert the 9000 shares of stock were issued in violation of Article 2.16 Business \nCorporation Act, and prayed that such stock be declared void and cancelled. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n656 \nTrial was before the Court without a jury which, after hearing, entered judgment declaring the 5000 \nshares of stock issued to Hurt, and the 4000 shares issued to Griffitts, issued without valid consideration, \nvoid, and decreeing such stock cancelled. \n* * * \n \nThe trial court found (on ample evidence) that the incorporators of the Corporation made an agreement \nwith Hurt to issue him 5000 shares in consideration of Hurt’s agreement to perform bookkeeping and \naccounting services for the Corporation for the first year of its operation. The Corporation minutes reflect \nthe 5000 shares issued to Hurt “in consideration of labor done, services in the incorporation and \norganization of the Corporation.” The trial court found (on ample evidence) that such minutes do not",

Manhart, the trial court determined that the 5000 shares of stock issued to Hurt and the 4000 shares issued to Griffitts were issued without valid consideration. The court found that there was no substantial evidence of actual performance of the promised services or conveyance of the land, thus declaring these shares void and cancelling them. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented, which indicated that the minutes reflecting the issuance of shares did not accurately represent the true consideration given, and that the agreements with Hurt and Griffitts were not fulfilled as stipulated."

                    "answer": "In the case of Champion v. CIR, the specific issues identified with the issuance of stock to Griffitts were related to the nature of the consideration provided. The stock was issued partly in consideration for legal services to the Corporation and partly in exchange for 5 acres of land. However, the trial court found that the 4000 shares of stock issued to Griffitts were in consideration of his promise to convey the land to the Corporation, but Griffitts never actually conveyed the land. Additionally, the court noted that the issuance of the stock was illegal and void because it did not meet the requirement that the consideration for the stock must be for services already performed, not just promised or to be performed in the future. This aligns with the ruling in Hurt, where the issuance of stock for services to be performed in the future was deemed illegal and void."

                    "answer": "The court ruled in the case of Hurt that the issuance of stock for services to be performed in the future was illegal and void. This ruling had significant implications for the issuance of stock to Griffitts, as the court found that the 4000 shares of stock issued to Griffitts were in consideration of his promise to convey the land to the Corporation, which was not fulfilled. Since the issuance of stock for services to be performed in the future was illegal according to the court's decision in Hurt, the issuance of the stock to Griffitts was similarly deemed illegal and void. This underscores the importance of ensuring that stock is only issued for services that have been or will be performed, rather than merely promised or to be performed in the future."

Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers.

The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3.

Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions.

However, these extreme actions are rarely employed. Instead, more commonly, the individuals within the corporation, including high-level executives, may face legal liability and even imprisonment. This is because modern law allows for the imputation of the criminal acts of an agent to the corporation, provided that the criminal act was within the scope of the agent's job duties. Furthermore, regulatory statutes like the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act now include provisions for legal punishments, though these are often dependent on the priorities of the current administration. State prosecuting attorneys have also become more proactive in pursuing criminal charges against corporate management when workplace accidents result in injury or death."

Section 8.01 of the Revised \nModel Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) states that “all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under \nthe authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, its board \nof directors.” A director is a fiduciary, a person to whom power is entrusted for another’s benefit, and as \nsuch, as the RMBCA puts it, must perform his duties “in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent \nperson in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances” (Section 8.30). A director’s main \nresponsibilities include the following: (1) to protect shareholder investments, (2) to select and remove \nofficers, (3) to delegate operating authority to the managers or other groups, and (4) to supervise the \ncompany as a whole. \n \n \n \nDelegation to Committees \nUnder RMBCA Section 8.25, the board of directors, by majority vote, may delegate its powers to various \ncommittees. This authority is limited to some degree. For example, only the full board can determine \ndividends, approve a merger, and amend the bylaws. The delegation of authority to a committee does not, \nby itself, relieve a director from the duty to exercise due care. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n681 \nDelegation to Officers \n \nFigure 16.2 The Corporate Governance Model \n \n \nThe directors often delegate to officers the day-to-day authority to execute the policies established by the \nboard and to manage the firm (see Figure 16.2 \"The Corporate Governance Model\").

As a consequence of this breach, the directors were held liable for $23.5 million.

                    "answer": "Fiduciary duties for directors and officers are defined by the responsibilities they hold due to their positions within a corporation. Two main types of these duties exist: the duty of loyalty and the duty of care. The duty of loyalty requires directors to prioritize the corporation's interests over their personal interests when conflicts arise. The duty of care involves ensuring that decisions made on behalf of the corporation are made with reasonable care, skill, and diligence, avoiding any gross negligence that could harm the corporation. These duties have evolved over time through court rulings and legislative actions, which have both narrowed and broadened their scope."

Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand.

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation",

This definition is intentionally vague and flexible to ensure it can adapt to various types of instruments that might be sold as investments in the future. On the other hand, the Howey test, which focuses on the nature of the investment contract, requires a more specific set of criteria to be met, including the expectation of profit from the efforts of others.

They are useful devices for allocating the burdens of proof between parties, arising out of considerations of fairness, public policy, and probability, as well as judicial economy. In the context of demonstrating causal connections, presumptions can help manage situations where direct evidence is lacking or hard to obtain."

Furthermore, it is suggested that 'it is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity. Who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game?' This common sense and probability rationale, along with the empirical support, justify the presumption of reliance for purposes of a Rule 10b-5 action."

How a corporation can expand by purchasing assets of another company without purchasing stock or \notherwise merging with the company whose assets are purchased \n2. The benefits of expanding through a purchase of assets rather than stock \n3. Both the benefits and potential detriments of merging with another company \n4.

Corporate dissolution and its various types \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n746 \n \nThis chapter begins with a discussion of the various ways a corporation can expand. We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC.",

The continuation or dissolution of XYZ depends on the extent of the asset purchase. If only a portion of XYZ's assets are acquired, it might retain some assets and continue operating. However, if ABC Corporation buys out nearly all of XYZ's assets, the corporation may cease to exist, leaving only the purchased assets under the control of ABC Corporation."

Suppose BCT paid Flying Truckman $250,000 for its trucks, routes, and name. \nWith that cash, Flying Truckman paid off several of its creditors. Its shareholders then voted to dissolve \nthe corporation, leaving one creditor unsatisfied. The creditor can no longer sue Flying Truckman since it \ndoes not exist. So he sues BCT. Unless certain circumstances exist, as discussed in Ray v. Alad \nCorporation (see Section 18.4.1 \"Successor Liability\"), BCT is not liable for Flying Truckman’s debts. \n \nSeveral states, although not a majority, have adopted the Ray product-line exception approach to \nsuccessor liability. The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability. Other jurisdictions also permit a continuity-of-\nenterprise exception, whereby the court examines how closely the acquiring corporation’s business is to \nthe acquired corporation’s business (e.g., see Turner v. Bituminous Casualty Co.).[2] \n \nMerger \nWhen the assets of a company are purchased, the selling company itself may or may not go out of \nexistence. By contrast, in a merger, the acquired company goes out of existence by being absorbed into the \nacquiring company. In the example in Section 18.1.2 \"Merger\", Flying Truck would merge into BCT, \nresulting in Flying Truckman losing its existence.

                    "answer": "The distribution of Holmes' catalogs in Louisiana reflects a substantial nexus with the state because Holmes had some level of control over the catalogs' distribution, even if not complete. Although Holmes might not have had direct control over how and where the catalogs were distributed in Louisiana, their presence in the state and their role in increasing sales within the state establish a connection that justifies the application of the use tax. A substantial nexus is important for the application of the use tax because it ensures that businesses operating in a state, even if only partially or indirectly, contribute to the state's revenue base through taxes. In this case, the use tax on Holmes' catalogs is related to the advantages provided by the state, such as the services mentioned earlier, which aid Holmes' business. Thus, the substantial nexus supports the application of the use tax without violating the Commerce Clause."

The key to the success of this invention is the concept of negotiability: through \nthis process, a person can pass on—in most cases—better title to receive payment than he had; thus the \ntransferee of such paper will most likely get paid by the obligor and will not be subject to most defenses of \nany prior holders. The law of commercial paper has developed over the past four hundred years. It is now the \nUniform Commercial Code that governs most commercial paper transactions in the United States, but federal \nor international preemption is possible in the future. Commercial paper is important in both economics and \nfinance. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If there were no such thing as commercial paper, real or virtual (electronic funds transfers), how would you \npay your bills? How did merchants have to pay their bills four hundred years ago? \n2.

Documents of title include bills of lading and warehouse \nreceipts and are governed by Article 7 of the UCC. Investment securities are covered by Article 8. \nInstruments that fall within the scope of Article 3 may also be subject to Article 4 (bank deposits and \ncollections), Article 8 (securities), and Article 9 (secured transactions).

                    "answer": "Notes and commercial paper differ in terms of security and duration. Notes are unsecured and can be long-term, whereas commercial paper includes a variety of financial instruments like long-term notes (often secured), drafts, checks, and certificates of deposit. Notes, however, are considered nearly as safe as US government obligations due to their historical stability and low risk profile. This safety stems from the strong creditworthiness of the issuers and the lack of default history, making them a reliable form of debt financing."

[1] \n \nThe drawer directs the funds to be drawn from—pulled from—the drawee, and the drawee pays the person \nentitled to payment as directed. \n \nTypes of Drafts \nDrafts can be divided into two broad subcategories: sight drafts and time drafts. \n \nA sight draft calls for payment “on sight,” that is, when presented. Recall from Section 19.1 \n\"Introduction to Commercial Paper\" that Lorna Love wished to buy tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc. \nSuppose Love had the money to pay but did not want to do so before delivery. Rackets, on the other hand, \ndid not want to ship before Love paid. The solution: a sight draft, drawn on Love, to which would be \nattached an order bill of lading that Rackets received from the trucker when it shipped the rackets. The \nsight draft and bill of lading go to a bank in Love’s city. When the tennis rackets arrive, the carrier notifies \nthe bank, which presents the draft to Love for payment. When she has done so, the bank gives Love the \nbill of lading, entitling her to receive the shipment. The bank forwards the payment to Rackets’ bank, \nwhich credits Rackets’ account with the purchase amount. \n \nA time draft, not surprisingly, calls for payment on a date specified in the draft. Suppose that Love will \nnot have sufficient cash to pay until she has sold the rackets but that Rackets needs to be paid \nimmediately. The solution: a common form of time draft known as a trade acceptance. Rackets, the seller, \ndraws a draft on Love, who thus becomes a drawee. The draft orders Love to pay the purchase price to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n784 \norder of Rackets, as payee, on a fixed date. Rackets presents the draft to Love, who accepts it by signing \nher name. Rackets then can indorse the draft (by signing it) and sell it, at a discount, to its bank or some \nother financial institution. Rackets thus gets its money right away; the bank may collect from Love on the \ndate specified.

Upon delivery, the carrier notifies the bank, which then presents the sight draft to Love for immediate payment. Once Love pays, the bank provides her with the bill of lading, allowing her to take possession of the shipment. The bank subsequently forwards the payment to Rackets, Inc., the seller's bank, crediting their account with the purchase amount. This process ensures that the seller receives payment only after the goods have been delivered, while the buyer has the assurance that the payment will be made upon receiving the goods."

After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786 \nA second type of commercial paper is the common bank check, a special form of draft. Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\". The \nmaker might execute a promissory note in return for a money loan from a bank or other financial \ninstitution or in return for the opportunity to make a purchase on credit. \n \nFigure 19.4 A Promissory Note \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n787 \n \n \nCertificates of Deposit \nA fourth type of commercial paper is the certificate of deposit, commonly called a CD.

The process of certifying a check involves the drawee bank accepting the check and guaranteeing that it will honor the check when presented.

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it.

                    "question": "What distinguishes the negotiation process of bearer paper from that of order paper?",
                    "answer": "The negotiation process of bearer paper is simpler compared to order paper. Bearer paper can be negotiated simply by delivering it to the transferee, as it runs to whoever is in possession of it, regardless of rightful ownership. In contrast, order paper, which specifies a payee and is issued 'to order,' requires an indorsement by the payee to allow further negotiation. This indorsement involves signing the instrument, typically on the back, to authorize the transfer to another party. The indorsement is crucial because it transfers the right to enforce the instrument to the new holder, and without it, the transferee, even if in physical possession, would not be considered a holder."

                    "answer": "Despite the simplicity of bearer paper's negotiation process, a purchaser might still request an indorsement on some bearer paper for increased security. This is because the indorsement increases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. For instance, when a check is made out to 'cash' and the purchaser is asked to indorse it, the indorsement serves as a form of guarantee. In the case of Chung v. New York Racing Association, the court addressed the issue where the check was negotiated without proper indorsement, highlighting the importance of this step in ensuring the validity and enforceability of the instrument. Thus, while bearer paper is negotiable by mere delivery, certain purchasers might insist on an indorsement for added protection."

Under UCC Section 1-201(43), a forgery is an “unauthorized \nsignature.” Section 3-403(a) provides that any unauthorized signature on an instrument is “ineffective \nexcept as the signature of the unauthorized signer.” The consequence is that, generally, the loss falls on \nthe first party to take the instrument with a forged or unauthorized signature because that person is in the \nbest position to prevent the loss. \n \nLorna Love writes a check to Steve Supplier on her account at First State Bank, but the check goes astray \nand is found by Carl Crooks. Crooks indorses the check “Steve Supplier” and presents it for cash to a busy \nteller who fails to request identification. Two days later, Steve Supplier inquires about his check. Love \ncalls First State Bank to stop payment. Too late—the check has been cashed. Who bears the loss—Love, \nSupplier, or the bank? The bank does, and it must recredit Love’s account. The forged indorsement on the \ncheck was ineffective; the bank was not a holder, and the check should not have been allowed into the \nchannels of commerce.

This matter arises out of thefts \nfrom Victory’s commercial checking account by its office manager and bookkeeper, Jeanette Lunny \n(“Lunny”). Lunny was employed by Victory for approximately twenty-four (24) years until she resigned in \nMay 2003. From August 2001 through May 2003, Lunny deposited approximately two hundred (200) \nchecks drawn on Victory’s corporate account totaling $188,273.00 into her personal checking account at \ndefendant Wachovia Bank (“Wachovia”). Lunny’s scheme called for engaging in “double forgeries” \n(discussed infra). Lunny would prepare the checks in the company’s computer system, and make the \nchecks payable to known vendors of Victory (e.g., Adidas, Sean John), to whom no money was actually \nowed. The checks were for dollar amounts that were consistent with the legitimate checks to those \nvendors. She would then forge the signature of Victory’s owner, Mark Rosenfeld (“Rosenfeld”), on the \nfront of the check, and then forge the indorsement of the unintended payee (Victory’s various vendors) on \nthe reverse side of the check. The unauthorized checks were drawn on Victory’s bank account at Hudson",

In the given text, the focus is on the theft of checks from Victory Clothing's account. The concept of order paper relates more to the specifics of negotiable instruments and their handling, rather than the technical setup of a machine.

It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees.

For example, if A contracts with B to buy a car for $5,000, the promise itself constitutes 'value' and supports the HDC status. Conversely, if Lorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Love negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets, but Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets, the promise to deliver the rackets remains executory and thus does not provide 'value' for HDC status."

                    "answer": "The concept of 'good faith' under the UCC is pivotal in determining the validity and enforceability of transfers of negotiable instruments. It encompasses two primary aspects: honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. 'Honesty in fact' is evaluated subjectively, meaning that the individual's intentions and actions must be genuine without deceit or fraudulent intent. In contrast, 'observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing' is assessed objectively, focusing on whether the transaction adheres to typical business practices and norms. For instance, purchasing a promissory note at a significant discount may not inherently indicate a lack of good faith, as it could simply reflect a negotiated transaction within the bounds of commercial reasonableness. However, the overall context and specific circumstances surrounding the transaction would also be considered to ensure that the transfer aligns with fair and customary business practices."

For a check-cashing business to achieve HDC status, it must act in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, even if it is negligent. However, the acceptance of a postdated check without verifying the funds could be seen as not acting in a commercially reasonable manner, potentially leading to the loss of HDC status. Since check cashing is an unregulated business in Ohio, there are no concrete commercial standards that must be followed. The Ohio legislature aimed to impose a duty on these entities to act responsibly to secure HDC status. Thus, a check-cashing business like Buckeye, which failed to verify the funds on a postdated check, would not meet the objective prong of the good faith test and hence would not qualify for HDC status."

Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments.

                    "answer": "According to UCC Section 3-416, a person who receives consideration for transferring an instrument makes five specific warranties: 1) the transferor is entitled to enforce the instrument, 2) all signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized, 3) the instrument has not been altered, 4) the instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment that can be asserted against the warrantor, and 5) the warranty runs with the instrument. These warranties imply that the transferee or any subsequent holder who takes the instrument in good faith can sue the transferor for breach of any of these warranties, provided they are not a holder in due course."

Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it \n(when there was), or that the drawer’s signature was authorized (when it was not), or that there were \nsufficient funds in the drawer’s account to pay it (when there were not), “the drawee may recover the \namount paid…or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.” [6]Except—and it’s a big \nexception—such a recovery of funds does not apply “against a person who took the instrument in good \nfaith and for value.” [7] The drawee in that case would have to go after the forger, the unauthorized signer, \nor, in the case of insufficient funds, the drawer. Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it. Able’s bank cannot get the money back from Baker: it has to go after",

However, this recovery is limited to cases where the person who took the instrument did not act in good faith and did not pay for value.

However, if requiring a thumbprint is not considered 'reasonable,' the bank's refusal might be deemed dishonoring the draft under Section 3-502(b)(2).

                    "answer": "The text covers several types of financial ratios that are used to assess various aspects of a company's financial health. Operating efficiency ratios, such as asset turnover ratio and inventory turnover ratio, measure how effectively a company utilizes its assets and manages its inventory. Liquidity ratios, including current ratio and quick ratio, indicate a company's ability to meet short-term obligations. Solvency ratios, such as debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio, evaluate a company's long-term financial stability. Market value ratios, like price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio, reflect market perceptions of a company's value. Profitability ratios, including return on assets and return on equity, provide insights into a company's earnings performance.

This principle is applied in various financial contexts through the use of single payment value, equal multiple payments, and unequal multiple payment values. The text explains that the timing of cash flows is crucial in calculating present and future values. It introduces methods for solving TVM problems, including the use of financial calculators and spreadsheet software like Excel. Applications of TVM in finance are demonstrated through scenarios involving perpetuities, annuities, loan amortization, and interest rate conversions between stated and effective rates. These concepts help in making informed decisions about investments, loans, and other financial instruments by considering the impact of time on money."

In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment.

First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships.

For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid.

Firstly, corporations offer limited ownership liability, which significantly reduces the risks faced by investors. This means that if the corporation incurs losses or faces legal issues, the personal assets of the shareholders are generally protected. Secondly, corporations can raise substantial funding through issuing stocks, enabling them to undertake significant growth projects, investments, and other opportunities that might not be feasible for smaller entities. Additionally, the liquidity of corporate shares allows for easy transferability and investment attractiveness, as stocks are typically more liquid than other forms of business ownership, such as proprietorships or partnerships, which often carry unlimited liability.

Although it is common for large corporations to incorporate as traditional C corporations, Amazon's decision to use an LLC structure for its subsidiary, Amazon.com Services LLC, highlights specific benefits. LLCs offer pass-through taxation, where profits and losses are reported directly on the personal tax returns of the members, avoiding the double taxation issue that comes with traditional corporations. Furthermore, LLCs provide flexibility in management and ownership, allowing for more fluid changes in the company's structure without the formalities required by corporations. Lastly, LLCs often offer enhanced protection against personal liability for members, similar to corporations but with potentially simpler administrative requirements. These factors, among others, likely influenced Amazon's choice to organize as an LLC, even within a broader corporate framework."

On the other hand, international firms, even if based in the United States, often have diverse and extensive international investments and operations, leading to varying legal and regulatory environments for their non-US subsidiaries. Parent companies of such international firms generally follow GAAP standards, but their non-US subsidiaries might be subject to local laws and regulations that differ significantly from those in the U.S., including potentially different accounting and governance practices."

As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos.

This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort.

A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\nthe room when the peso depreciates.

It increases when revenues (inflows resulting from providing goods and services) occur, as each dollar of revenue generated adds to the overall value of the organization. Conversely, expenses (outflows associated with generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization, with each dollar of expenses incurred reducing the overall value. Gains, which are increases in the value of the organization, also boost equity, while losses, which are decreases in the value of the organization, reduce equity. Investments by owners contribute positively to the equity, whereas distributions to owners have a negative impact.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

Conversely, a customer with terms of net 60 will take approximately 60 days to make payment, leading to a delay in cash receipt. This 50-day difference means the firm must cover its operational costs for a longer period without receiving cash. Thus, managing these terms effectively can enhance cash flow by optimizing the timing of cash receipts from customers."

It is calculated by dividing earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the interest expense. EBIT represents the company's operating profit before accounting for interest and taxes, which provides insight into the core earnings that can be used to cover interest payments. The TIE ratio is crucial because it helps assess the financial stability of a company, particularly its capacity to meet its interest obligations without relying heavily on cash flow from operations. A higher TIE ratio generally indicates a stronger ability to manage debt, whereas a lower ratio may signal potential financial distress and difficulty in meeting interest payments."

Decision-\nmakers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into\nthe future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past\nperiods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving\nforward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to\nvisualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.\nThroughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount. In this chapter,\nwe deal with a stream of payments made periodically—in other words, payments made or received regularly\nover a span of time.

We begin with the illustration of a perpetuity.\nWhat Is a Perpetuity?\nA perpetuity is a series of payments or receipts that continues forever, or perpetually. One of the best ways to\nanalyze the basics of an annuity (the stream of payments to be paid or received in the future) is by starting\nwith a perpetuity. The most common examples of perpetuities in the author’s experience are college chair\nendowments and preferred stock.\nIf you gift $1,500,000 to a college to name a professor’s chair for your family, you might specify that the money\nmust be held in perpetuity and invested by the college to yield a fixed 3%. The college will take those proceeds\nof the investment, leaving your original $1,500,000 intact, and use the annual interest of $45,000 to fund a\nportion of the professor’s salary.\nAnother common example is preferred stock. Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\n228\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org",

The text provides two primary examples of perpetuities: college chair endowments and preferred stock. A college chair endowment is an instance where a donor gifts a large sum of money to a college, stipulating that the money must be held in perpetuity and invested to generate a fixed annual interest, which is used to fund a portion of the professor's salary. Another example is preferred stock, where the dividend is fixed and predetermined, meaning shareholders receive a consistent annual payment, assuming the board of directors declares and pays the dividends."

We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the\nremaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in\ncash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.\nWe modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly\nrate by dividing by 12, resulting in\nBy substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):",

                    "answer": "Each fixed payment in the amortization table consists of both interest and principal repayment. Over time, the monthly interest portion decreases while the amount of principal repayment increases. This is because the amount of remaining debt is decreasing, leading to less interest charged each month and more principal being repaid with each payment."

Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5",

                    "answer": "Prepaying a loan with a windfall, such as a bonus received after three years, can significantly reduce both the total cost of financing and the repayment timeline. In the given scenario, a $2,000 bonus applied to the remaining balance of a mortgage not only reduces the total interest from over $56,000 to $55,000 but also results in the loan being fully paid off approximately six months earlier than originally scheduled. This demonstrates the substantial financial benefits of prepaying a loan with unexpected income, even if the amount seems relatively small compared to the regular monthly payments."

                    "answer": "Stated interest rates are typically the nominal or quoted interest rates that appear on documents like credit card statements, indicating the percentage charged on an outstanding balance each month. However, the effective interest rate takes into account the frequency of compounding within a year, which means it includes the effect of compounding interest on previously accrued interest. For instance, in the case of a credit card with a stated interest rate of 1.5% per month, the effective annual rate would be higher due to the compounding effect. The effective rate provides a more accurate reflection of the true cost of borrowing because it considers the impact of multiple compounding periods within a year, rather than just the stated rate, which assumes simple interest without compounding."

Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks.

This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.

                    "answer": "Reinvestment risk is the risk faced by bond investors when their callable bonds are redeemed by the issuer and they need to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate. When bond issuers offer new bonds with lower coupon rates, it can cause reinvestment risk because investors who have their bonds called may have to invest the returned principal in lower-yielding securities. This situation can lead to a reduction in overall returns for the investor since the new investments will generate less income than the original bond. Additionally, if interest rates have risen since the original bond was issued, the new investments will likely offer even lower yields, exacerbating the reinvestment risk."

                    "answer": "Term risk refers to the additional risk that investors take on when they purchase bonds with longer maturities. It arises from the uncertainty about future interest rate movements and the potential impact on bond prices. Investors typically demand higher returns for longer-term bonds because they are exposed to the risk of rising interest rates over the life of the bond. If interest rates increase, the value of existing bonds falls, and the returns from these bonds become less attractive compared to newly issued bonds paying higher interest rates. The term premium is a measure of this additional risk, representing the extra yield that investors require for committing their capital to a longer-term bond. By demanding higher returns, investors compensate themselves for the increased likelihood of experiencing negative price fluctuations due to rising interest rates."

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\n302\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIt is important to note that investment-grade bonds are among the most popular due to the fact that many\ncommercial banks, as well as several pension funds, are only allowed to trade bonds that are investment\ngrade.\nAny bond that is below investment grade, or rated lower than BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s), is referred to\nas a high-yield bond or a junk bond. Junk bonds have had mixed levels of success for companies wishing to\nissue them to raise capital. In the early 1990s, the market for junk bonds collapsed, due in part to a political\nmovement involving influential people who had been dominating corporate debt markets.

On the other hand, junk bonds, rated below investment grade, have experienced mixed success in the market.

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward.

Solving for the Dividend Growth Rate, we get: Dividend Growth Rate = 0.12 - (10 / 250) = 0.12 - 0.04 = 0.0769 or 7.69%. So, the growth rate is 7.69%."

                    "answer": "To calculate the present value of the stock using the variable growth model, we need to extend the constant growth model to include a separate calculation for each growth period. We determine the present values for each of these periods and then add them together to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. Here's how the calculation would look for Maddox Inc. over five years: For Year 0, the dividend is $2.00. For Year 1, the dividend is $2.00 * 1.05 = $2.10. For Year 2, the dividend is $2.10 * 1.05 = $2.21. For Year 3, the dividend is $2.21 * 1.05 = $2.32. For Year 4, the dividend is $2.32 * 1.05 = $2.43. For Year 5 and onwards, the growth rate changes to 3%. The present value of the dividends for Years 1 to 4 are calculated as follows: Year 1: $2.10 / (1 + 0.08)^1 = $1.9444. Year 2: $2.21 / (1 + 0.08)^2 = $1.8904. Year 3: $2.32 / (1 + 0.08)^3 = $1.8379. Year 4: $2.43 / (1 + 0.08)^4 = $1.7869. For Year 5 and beyond, we calculate the terminal value using the Gordon growth model: Terminal Value = Last Dividend * (1 + Growth Rate) / (Required Rate of Return - Growth Rate) = $2.43 * 1.03 / (0.08 - 0.03) = $50.07886. The present value of the terminal value is $50.07886 / (1 + 0.08)^4 = $35.7870. Adding up all the present values: $1.9444 + $1.8904 + $1.8379 + $1.7869 + $35.7870 = $43.2466.

It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms\nwithin any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The\nDCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and\nthen working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\nThis highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when\nevaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these\nare based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments\nthan revenues or bottom-line earnings.\nThe DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:\nwhere CF1 is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF2 is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the\nterminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale; r is the discount rate or required rate of\nreturn; g is the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; and n is the number of years covered in the model.\nApplying the DCF Model\nWe can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.\nCalculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.\nAssume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the\nterminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.\n11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\n341\nMayweather has a cash flow of $2.0 million in year 1, so its discounted cash flow after one year (CF1) is",

Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future.

                    "answer": "Negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs), also known as jumbo CDs, are significantly different from traditional CDs in terms of size, liquidity, and regulatory treatment. NCDs are issued by financial institutions and are redeemable only at maturity, but they often trade in a secondary market before maturity. This contrasts with traditional CDs, which typically have penalties for early withdrawal. NCDs are much larger, often sold in increments of $100,000 or more, and appeal primarily to institutional investors. Unlike traditional CDs, NCDs are not insured by the FDIC, and their interest rates are generally higher due to the longer period during which the issuing institution can use the funds. Moreover, the Federal Reserve imposes lower reserve requirements on NCDs compared to other types of deposits, allowing financial institutions to offer higher rates. The secondary market for NCDs provides greater liquidity, enabling investors to sell their holdings before maturity without incurring significant penalties."

This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500.

To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\nResult: 0.25249\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\nExponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.

                    "answer": "The normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. When the standard deviation changes, it affects the shape of the normal curve; if the standard deviation increases, the curve becomes fatter and wider, whereas if it decreases, the curve becomes skinnier and taller. This is because the area under the curve must always equal 1, so an increase in standard deviation spreads out the distribution, while a decrease makes it more concentrated around the mean."

To find the probability that an employee earns more than $75,000, you would then calculate 1 - NORM.DIST(75000, 60000, 7500, TRUE). The formula to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value in Excel is =NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE), where XVALUE is the value for which you want the distribution, MEAN is the arithmetic mean of the distribution, and STANDARD_DEV is the standard deviation of the distribution."

One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years.

In contrast, a scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between two different variables, plotting one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.

Many typical applications involve\ndetermining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and\nthe Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is\nobserved, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance. If the correlation coefficient is\nsignificant, a linear model can then be generated and used for predictions.\n14.5 Predictions and Prediction Intervals\nA key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to then use the model for predictions, provided that\nthe correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute\nthe value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\nvariable (y). When making predictions using the linear model, it is generally recommended to only predict\nvalues for y using values of x that are in the original range of the data collection.\n14.6 Use of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry and can be found online\n(https://openstax.org/r/finance_industry).

This process, often referred to as the least squares method, helps in determining the coefficients 'a' and 'b' in the regression equation, which represent the intercept and slope of the line, respectively. By minimizing these differences, the model aims to make the line as close as possible to all the data points, thereby providing the most accurate predictions based on the available data.

Manual calculations can be time-consuming and prone to errors, particularly when dealing with large datasets. These tools provide built-in functions and algorithms that perform the necessary computations efficiently and accurately. For instance, Excel offers the 'LINEST' function, while R provides packages like 'lm()' for fitting linear models. These tools not only save time but also ensure that the results are precise, allowing users to focus on interpreting the model's output and making informed decisions based on the data. Additionally, these technologies offer advanced features such as hypothesis testing, residual analysis, and visualization capabilities, which enhance the overall quality of the regression analysis and provide deeper insights into the relationships between variables."

Investors like to speak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities. This makes it a user-friendly tool for understanding the profitability of potential investments without needing to delve into complex calculations. Additionally, with the advent of modern technology such as financial calculators and spreadsheets, the task of computing the exact IRR has become significantly easier and less time-consuming."

                    "answer": "The IRR method can face challenges when dealing with projects that have multiple IRRs, especially if negative cash flows occur in more than one period. For instance, if a company is considering a project where the initial cost is high, followed by positive cash inflows, and then a significant outflow, the NPV profile might cross the horizontal axis more than once, indicating multiple IRRs. This situation arises because there are two interest rates at which the NPV equals zero. To address this, alternative methods such as Net Present Value (NPV) or Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) might be more appropriate, as they provide a clearer picture of the project's financial viability without the ambiguity of multiple IRRs."

This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.",

Firstly, the manager must understand the historical background from which the cost of capital was derived, including the beta estimate. It's not sufficient to merely know the beta value; the manager must also be able to determine the reasons behind the estimates. Secondly, the manager must be familiar with the company's operations and the economic environment to assess what set of assumptions would likely be reasonable for future projections. While the numbers are based on past data, the primary concern of the financial manager is predicting future outcomes. The equity cost of capital is also influenced by the company's industry, as different sectors exhibit varying levels of volatility. For instance, grocery stores and food product providers often have lower betas due to stable consumer demand during both economic expansions and contractions, leading to a lower range of equity cost of capital. Conversely, industries like airlines and home builders, which experience significant fluctuations in sales during economic cycles, typically have higher betas and consequently higher equity cost of capital to compensate for increased risk."

                    "answer": "The beta of a company plays a crucial role in determining its equity cost of capital. Beta measures the volatility of a company's stock relative to the overall market. Companies with a beta less than 1 are considered less risky compared to the market, while those with a beta greater than 1 are seen as more volatile and thus riskier. As a result, companies with a beta less than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below the average range of 8% to 11%, while companies with a beta greater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that exceeds this range. Examples of industries with low betas include grocery stores and providers of food products. These companies generally maintain stable sales regardless of economic conditions because consumers continue to buy essential items like food even during recessions. In contrast, industries with high betas, such as airlines and home builders, experience significant swings in sales during economic expansions and contractions. During good times, there's increased travel and housing purchases, while during downturns, these discretionary expenses are reduced, leading to higher betas and corresponding equity cost of capital to attract investors willing to take on the associated risks."

In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance.

For example, cash flow from operating activities indicates how much cash is generated from the core business operations, while cash used for investing activities shows the amount of cash spent on investments such as property, plant, and equipment. Similarly, cash used for financing activities reflects the cash impact of financing decisions like issuing or repaying debt and paying dividends.

Additionally, the balance sheet's equity balances provide information for the statement of stockholders' equity. Furthermore, the income statement and balance sheet offer critical data points for the statement of cash flows, including net income and noncash expenses, changes in working capital accounts, and asset and liability balances. Considering these interconnections is crucial because it ensures that the forecast is built on a solid foundation of accurate and consistent financial data.

            "chunk": "An account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581",

This practice is important because it helps in estimating the likelihood of non-payment, thereby aiding in financial planning and risk assessment. By understanding the age distribution of receivables, businesses can identify potential problem areas and take proactive measures to mitigate losses from uncollectible debts.

Each category is assigned an estimated uncollectible percentage based on historical data and the perceived risk associated with the age of the receivables. For instance, accounts within the 0-30 days category might have a lower uncollectible percentage, say 6%, whereas those in the 90+ days category might carry a higher uncollectible percentage, possibly 40%. The schedule involves summing up the estimated uncollectible amounts across all categories to derive a total estimated uncollectible balance. This process allows businesses to make informed decisions about their credit policies, collection strategies, and financial reporting, ensuring that they maintain accurate records of potential bad debts."

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book.

                    "answer": "A Korean company that will need to pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months can use a call option to manage its currency risk. Since its bank account is denominated in Korean won, the company needs to convert its Korean won to US dollars in six months. It can determine the number of Korean won required to purchase $100,000 today using the current exchange rate (spot rate), but it does not know the future exchange rate. By purchasing a call option, the company can lock in the price for the US dollars in six months, which is known as the strike price (exercise price). This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months without being obligated to purchase the dollars at that price if a better price is available when it needs them in six months."

                    "answer": "Transaction risk refers to the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the value of a business's expected receipts or expenses. This means that if a company conducts transactions in foreign currencies, fluctuations in exchange rates can affect the actual value of those transactions when converted into the company's home currency. For example, if a company sells goods in euros but reports its financial results in dollars, a strengthening euro would reduce the dollar value of those sales, thereby increasing the transaction risk."
