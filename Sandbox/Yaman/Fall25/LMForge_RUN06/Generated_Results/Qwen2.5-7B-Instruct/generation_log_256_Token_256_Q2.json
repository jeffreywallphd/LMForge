Alternatively, women faced hostile working environments that jeopardized their chances of promotion or retention, which became known as 'hostile working environment' sexual harassment. Although Title VII did not explicitly mention sexual harassment, it prohibited discrimination 'because of' sex, allowing for the development of specific rules and guidelines through civil litigation."

The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies. It has also given you a brief background in common \nlaw, including contracts, torts, and criminal law. The differences between civil and criminal cases, \nsubstance and procedure, and the various sources of law have also been reviewed.

                    "answer": "Social interests refer to the concerns of stakeholders who are not directly connected to an organization but still have a vested interest in ensuring that the organization operates in a socially responsible manner. This can encompass a wide range of issues such as environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, community welfare, and ethical business conduct. The relationship between these stakeholders and the organization is based on the expectation that the organization will uphold high standards of social responsibility, which can influence its reputation, customer base, and overall success in the market. By addressing the needs and expectations of social interest stakeholders, organizations can enhance their public image and maintain a positive relationship with various segments of society."

Understanding the long-standing \nperspectives on ethics—utilitarianism, deontology, social contract, and virtue ethics—is helpful in sorting \nout the ethical issues that face us as individuals and businesses. Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices. A firm that has purpose and passion \nbeyond profitability is best poised to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders and can best position itself \nfor long-term, sustainable success for shareholders and other stakeholders as well. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nConsider again Milton Friedman’s article. \na.

These factors might include situations where a person was compelled to commit a crime under duress, or they had given their consent to the act that led to the crime. Additionally, certain regulatory requirements for health, safety, or the environment may also be considered if a crime was committed due to non-compliance with such requirements."

                    "answer": "Following a preliminary hearing, the prosecutor has two options: filing an information or asking the grand jury for an indictment. Filing an information involves the prosecutor submitting a document that states the crime of which the person being held is accused. This step essentially formalizes the charges against the individual. On the other hand, the grand jury, consisting of twenty-three members, convenes to assess if there is sufficient evidence to support a prosecution. Their role is not to decide on guilt or innocence, but rather to determine whether the case should proceed to trial. An indictment, issued by the grand jury, serves as their formal declaration of charges against the accused. Once indicted, the accused officially becomes a defendant. In both scenarios, the subsequent steps ensure that the legal process proceeds in a structured manner, with appropriate oversight and due process protections in place."

                    "answer": "After experiencing multiple incidents of housebreaking, including the loss of household items and damage to the property, the defendants took several actions to prevent further intrusions. They first installed No Trespassing signs, likely to deter potential trespassers. Additionally, they boarded up the windows and doors to make unauthorized entry more difficult. Finally, they set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house. This trap involved cleaning and oiling a 20-gauge shotgun, securing it to an iron bed with the barrel pointed at the bedroom door, and wiring the doorknob to the gun's trigger so that it would fire when the door was opened. The angle of the shotgun was carefully adjusted to target an intruder in the legs, ensuring minimal risk to life while still deterring trespassers."

In a sales contract covered by the UCC, if certain terms are left open or unspecified, a court may still find that a contract exists. This is because the UCC considers such open terms less critical to the establishment of a binding agreement. Conversely, in non-sales contracts, courts typically require all terms to be agreed upon by both parties, and the presence of open terms often leads to a determination that no contract was formed. Additionally, the UCC provides special treatment for 'merchants,' defined as individuals with specialized knowledge or expertise in the goods being traded.

The parties stipulated \nthat if he were held to be defendant’s employee, this created a bailment between the parties [and the \n“employer” would have to rebut a presumption of negligence if the customer’s property was not returned \nto the customer]. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n395 \nOn April 20, 1968, at about 10 P.M., plaintiff drove his 1967 Cadillac Coupe de Ville to the door of the \nDirectoire Restaurant at 160 East 48th Street in Manhattan. Standing in front of the door was Buster \nDouglas, dressed in a self-supplied uniform, comprised of a regular doorman’s cap and matching jacket.",

Directoire Restaurant, Inc. was whether the defendant restaurant by permitting an individual named Buster Douglas to park patrons' cars, held him out as its 'employee' for such purposes. Although Buster Douglas was not actually employed by the restaurant in the traditional sense, he was known to be stationed in front of the restaurant wearing a doorman's uniform and parking the restaurant's customers' automobiles. This situation led to a stipulation that if Buster Douglas were deemed an employee of the defendant restaurant, it would create a bailment relationship between the parties, and the restaurant would have to rebut a presumption of negligence if the customer's property was not returned."

                    "answer": "The concept of implied authority is crucial in business because it allows for the reasonable interpretation of actions that a principal might have authorized without explicit instructions. This concept is vital in situations where agents need to make decisions quickly or in emergencies, as it ensures that they can act within the scope of their apparent authority without needing specific permission every time. It fosters efficiency and flexibility in business operations, while also providing a legal basis for holding principals accountable for the actions of their agents under certain circumstances. Implied authority helps maintain the integrity of business relationships and supports the principle of agency law that seeks to protect both principals and third parties who rely on the apparent authority of an agent."

The most obvious scenario is the expiration of a fixed period of time, such as 'agency to terminate at the end of three months' or 'on midnight, December 31.' Another example is when a specified act is accomplished, like 'on the sale of the house.' Additionally, termination can occur following a specific event, such as 'at the conclusion of the last horse race.' Furthermore, mutual consent between the parties can bring about the end of the agency. In cases where the principal wishes to end the agreement, they may revoke it. Similarly, the agent can renounce the agency, both actions constituting express termination. It's important to note that even if a contract explicitly states it is irrevocable, the principal or agent still retains the ability to breach the agreement, though this could lead to legal consequences. However, if the agency is coupled with an interest, meaning the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the agent has in the subject matter of the agency, the principal cannot revoke the agreement."

Furthermore, the passage notes that if the parties do not specify these details in their agreement, the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) will provide defaults for them."

There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states.

                    "answer": "Commercial paper is issued by corporations and financial institutions rather than the government, making it a form of short-term unsecured debt. It has a maturity ranging from one day to 270 days, which allows for reduced Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight. Unlike T-bills, commercial paper does not have a robust secondary market, meaning that once issued, it is not easily traded. This lack of a secondary market means that commercial paper primarily serves the immediate financing needs of issuers without the benefit of liquidity for investors."

You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price.

                    "answer": "The demand curve for pizzas is downward sloping due to two primary reasons. Firstly, the marginal utility principle states that as you consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) gained from consuming each extra unit decreases. So, early pizzas provide more satisfaction and thus can be purchased at higher prices, while later pizzas provide less additional satisfaction and must be sold at lower prices. Secondly, the law of demand considers not just willingness but also the ability to pay. As the price of pizza increases, individuals with limited income find it increasingly difficult to afford the same quantity of pizzas, leading to a decrease in the quantity demanded."

In contrast, corporations are typically more stable and less likely to face sudden financial crises. Additionally, when lending to individuals, there is often no collateral available in case of default, unlike car loans where lenders can repossess the vehicle to recover some of the lost funds.

This assumption is made because land is considered a non-consumable resource that does not wear out or become obsolete over time. As a result, it is not subject to depreciation, and its value remains at the historical cost on the books indefinitely."

                    "answer": "A 2:1 current ratio is considered quite high for most companies and industries, as it suggests the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities. This is generally considered to be more than sufficient to cover short-term obligations. However, when combined with low accounts receivable turnover, an analyst might infer that there could be issues related to management performance. Specifically, the high current ratio could indicate excessive inventory levels, while the low accounts receivable turnover might suggest difficulties in collecting payments from customers, which together could point to potential trouble areas in the company's operations."

This preference is rooted in several factors: first, the ability to save or invest the money immediately can lead to earning interest or returns, thereby increasing the total amount of money available in the future. Second, there's an inherent risk associated with any promise of future payments, which could potentially go unfulfilled if the payer defaults. Lastly, human psychology plays a role, as individuals generally prefer to consume goods and services in the present rather than waiting for them in the future. Given these reasons, TVM underscores the importance of incentivizing people to forego current consumption in favor of future rewards, as a dollar today is indeed more valuable than a dollar promised tomorrow."

It suggests that the nominal interest rate is approximately equal to the sum of the real interest rate and the expected inflation rate. This relationship is crucial because it helps economists and investors understand how changes in inflation expectations affect borrowing and lending costs, influencing monetary policy decisions and overall economic stability."

Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity.

Conversely, as interest rates began to decline in late 1981, bond prices increased, resulting in significant positive returns for investors."

In over 40 years of investing in bonds and other types of fixed-\nincome securities worldwide, Bill Gross earned his moniker “the bond king.”\nIn 1971, Gross cofounded and began his long tenure as managing director and chief investment officer of\nPacific Investment Management Company, better known as Pimco. Gross was not yet 30 years old, but he\nhad already graduated from college, served in the Navy in Vietnam, and even briefly worked as a\nprofessional blackjack player in Las Vegas to bankroll the cost of his MBA from UCLA.\nGross helped change the definition of success for bond investors by focusing on total returns, including\nprice changes, rather than simply bond yields. He used mathematical modeling and invested worldwide\nand in different types of bond markets seeking risk-adjusted returns. Gross made active rather than passive\nmanagement of bond funds a successful investment strategy. In the process, he changed how mangers\noversee fixed-income portfolios today.\nPimco grew into an investment powerhouse under Gross’s direction, eventually managing over $1.5 trillion",

His expertise in managing bond funds and his innovative approach to investing, which included a focus on total returns, active management, and a global perspective, were key factors in his success. Gross's ability to apply mathematical modeling and invest across various bond markets to achieve risk-adjusted returns further solidified his reputation as one of the most successful bond investors ever."

                    "answer": "Bill Gross deviated from traditional passive management strategies by actively managing bond funds to achieve higher returns. Unlike passive managers who merely track and mirror the performance of a specific index, Gross sought to outperform benchmarks through strategic investments. He focused on total returns, which encompass both price changes and interest income, rather than just bond yields. Additionally, Gross expanded his investment scope beyond domestic markets, adopting a global outlook that allowed him to capitalize on opportunities across different bond markets. His use of mathematical modeling and risk-adjusted return analysis set him apart from conventional investment practices."
