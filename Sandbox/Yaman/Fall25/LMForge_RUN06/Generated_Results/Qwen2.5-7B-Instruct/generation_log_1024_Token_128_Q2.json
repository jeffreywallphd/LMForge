The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French \ncourts may feel bound to reach the same result in future cases, under the doctrine of jurisprudence \nconstante. The major agency for growth and change, however, is the legislature, not the courts.” \n \nCivil-law systems are used throughout Europe as well as in Central and South America. Some nations in \nAsia and Africa have also adopted codes based on European civil law. Germany, Holland, Spain, France, \nand Portugal all had colonies outside of Europe, and many of these colonies adopted the legal practices \nthat were imposed on them by colonial rule, much like the original thirteen states of the United States, \nwhich adopted English common-law practices. \n \nOne source of possible confusion at this point is that we have already referred to US civil law in contrast to \ncriminal law. But the European civil law covers both civil and criminal law. \nThere are also legal systems that differ significantly from the common-law and civil-law systems. The \ncommunist and socialist legal systems that remain (e.g., in Cuba and North Korea) operate on very \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n31 \ndifferent assumptions than those of either English common law or European civil law. Islamic and other \nreligion-based systems of law bring different values and assumptions to social and commercial relations. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal systems vary widely in their aims and in the way they process civil and criminal cases. Common-law \nsystems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

                    "question": "What are the key differences between common-law and civil-law systems in how they process civil and criminal cases?",
                    "answer": "Common-law systems use juries, have one judge, and adhere to precedent. In contrast, civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, often use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. This difference arises due to the fact that in common-law systems, judges rely on past judicial decisions to guide current cases, whereas in civil-law systems, the primary source of law is the codified statutes, and judges are less bound by previous rulings."

See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n• \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord with the law \nSection 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act sets out those standards. While it is difficult to show that \nan agency’s action is arbitrary and capricious, there are cases that have so held. For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year.",

            "chunk": "Section 8.03 of the RMBCA provides that there must be one director, but there may be more, the precise \nnumber to be fixed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting. A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers. They must exercise these powers with good faith. Certain decisions \nmay be delegated to a committee or to corporate officers. There must be at least one director, and directors",
