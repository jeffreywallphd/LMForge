                    "answer": "In the context of legal proceedings, 'personal jurisdiction' refers to the authority of a court to hear a case involving specific individuals or entities. It pertains to the question of which defendants can be sued in that court, and whether the court has the necessary connection or relationship with the defendant to assert its power over them. This concept is crucial because it ensures that a defendant is properly before the court, and it prevents a plaintiff from unnecessarily wasting time by filing a lawsuit in an inappropriate forum."
