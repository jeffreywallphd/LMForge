The law establishes a moral minimum and does so especially in the area of criminal laws; if you \nbreak a criminal law, you can lose your freedom (in jail) or your life (if you are convicted of a capital \noffense). In a civil action, you would not be sent to prison; in the worst case, you can lose property \n(usually money or other assets), such as when Ford Motor Company lost a personal injury case and the \njudge awarded $295 million to the plaintiffs or when Pennzoil won a $10.54 billion verdict against Texaco \n(see Chapter 7 \"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nSome of the basic differences between civil law and criminal law cases are illustrated in Table 1.1 \n\"Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases\". \n \n \nTable 1.1 Differences between Civil and Criminal Cases \n \n \nCivil Cases \nCriminal Cases \nParties \nPlaintiff brings case; defendant must answer or lose \nby default \nProsecutor brings case; defendant may \nremain silent \nProof \nPreponderance of evidence \nBeyond a reasonable doubt \nReason \nTo settle disputes peacefully, usually between \nprivate parties \nTo maintain order in society \n \n \nTo punish the most blameworthy \n \n \nTo deter serious wrongdoing \nRemedies Money damages (legal remedy) \nFines, jail, and forfeitures \n \nInjunctions (equitable remedy) \n \n \nSpecific performance (equity) \n \n \nRegarding plaintiffs and prosecutors, you can often tell a civil case from a criminal case by looking at the \ncaption of a case going to trial.

In terms of parties, in a civil case, a plaintiff initiates the case, while in a criminal case, the prosecution (typically the government) brings the case. Regarding proof, a preponderance of evidence is required in civil cases, whereas the standard for criminal cases is 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' The purpose of a civil case is generally to resolve disputes peacefully, usually between private parties, whereas the aim of a criminal case is to maintain societal order, punish the most culpable, and deter serious wrongdoing. In terms of remedies, civil cases typically involve monetary damages or equitable remedies like injunctions or specific performance, while criminal cases may result in fines, imprisonment, or forfeitures."

The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v.

We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies.

These rules dictate how individuals and entities should interact with one another and with the government. Examples of substantive rules include: driving within a posted speed limit, avoiding price-fixing conspiracies, not making false claims about the efficacy of products, obeying traffic signals, prohibiting discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or national origin, and obtaining permits before discharging pollutants into water bodies. On the other hand, procedural rules outline the methods and processes to follow when dealing with substantive legal issues. They guide the steps involved in legal proceedings.

By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country.

This means that even if the conduct does not seriously affect an employee's psychological well-being or lead to a nervous breakdown, it can still be actionable under Title VII if it is so severe or pervasive that it makes the work environment abusive due to the employee's race, gender, religion, or national origin. The conduct must be perceived as hostile or abusive by the victim, which is a subjective factor, and it must also be perceived as such by a reasonable person, making it objectively abusive. The law recognizes that such conduct, even if not psychologically injurious, can still have tangible effects on job performance, job retention, and career advancement, and it offends the principle of workplace equality set forth in Title VII."

At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states.

However, despite their apparent separation, these court systems intersect through various means. State courts are required to adhere to federal law when state laws conflict with federal ones, according to the supremacy clause of the Constitution. Additionally, claims arising from federal statutes can often be heard in state courts if the Constitution or Congress does not mandate exclusive federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, under the full faith and credit clause, state courts must recognize and enforce the judgments of other states, ensuring that legal disputes are not re-litigated in different jurisdictions. State courts also frequently need to consider the laws of other states when dealing with interstate issues, such as traffic accidents occurring in multiple states, thereby necessitating the application of another state's laws to resolve the case."

For instance, state courts must uphold federal law whenever there is a conflict with state legislation, as mandated by the supremacy clause of the Constitution. This ensures that federal laws take precedence over conflicting state laws. In addition, state courts can hear federal law-based claims unless the Constitution or Congress specifically designates exclusive federal jurisdiction. The full faith and credit clause requires state courts to recognize and enforce the judgments of other states, preventing the same legal issue from being re-litigated in different jurisdictions. Moreover, when dealing with interstate matters, such as disputes involving parties from different states or incidents occurring in multiple states, state courts often need to apply the laws of another state to resolve the case. This interplay between state and federal courts highlights the intricate relationship between the two systems in ensuring a cohesive and fair legal framework across the United States."

Federal courts will consider state-law-based claims when a \ncase involves claims using both state and federal law. Claims based on federal laws will permit the \nfederal court to take jurisdiction over the whole case, including any state issues raised. In those \ncases, the federal court is said to exercise “pendent jurisdiction” over the state claims. Also, the \nSupreme Court will occasionally take appeals from a state supreme court where state law raises an \nimportant issue of federal law to be decided. For example, a convict on death row may claim that the \nstate’s chosen method of execution using the injection of drugs is unusually painful and involves \n“cruel and unusual punishment,” raising an Eighth Amendment issue. \nThere is also a broad category of cases heard in federal courts that concern only state legal issues—\nnamely, cases that arise between citizens of different states. The federal courts are permitted to hear \nthese cases under their so-called diversity of citizenship jurisdiction (or diversity jurisdiction). A \ncitizen of New Jersey may sue a citizen of New York over a contract dispute in federal court, but if \nboth were citizens of New Jersey, the plaintiff would be limited to the state courts.

After the American Revolution, state courts \nfunctioned (with some differences) much like they did in colonial times. The big difference after 1789 was \nthat state courts coexisted with federal courts. Federalism was the system devised by the nation’s \nfounders in which power is shared between states and the federal government. This sharing requires a \ndivision of labor between the states and the federal government.

The basic idea is to help the parties determine what the evidence might be, who the potential \nwitnesses are, and what specific issues are relevant. Discovery can proceed by several methods. A party \nmay serve an interrogatory on his adversary—a written request for answers to specific questions. Or a \nparty may depose the other party or a witness. A deposition is a live question-and-answer session at which \nthe witness answers questions put to him by one of the parties’ lawyers. His answers are recorded \nverbatim and may be used at trial. Each party is also entitled to inspect books, documents, records, and \nother physical items in the possession of the other.

Discovery of physical evidence means that a plaintiff may inspect a \ncompany’s accounts, customer lists, assets, profit-and-loss statements, balance sheets, engineering and \nquality-control reports, sales reports, and virtually any other document. \n \nThe lawyers, not the court, run the discovery process.

A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests.

Through this process, parties can obtain information about their opponents' claims and defenses, which helps them prepare for trial more effectively.

                    "answer": "The discovery process ensures fairness and prevents unreasonable demands through a combination of self-regulation by the lawyers and judicial oversight. Lawyers handle the discovery process without direct court intervention, allowing them to manage the exchange of information efficiently. However, if a party unreasonably resists discovery methods like depositions, written interrogatories, or document requests, the opposing party can challenge these actions. Judges step in to address such disputes, ensuring that requests are reasonable and not aimed at harassment. Additionally, the party receiving the discovery request has the right to apply for a protective order if the demand seeks privileged material or is otherwise inappropriate. This system balances the need for thorough investigation with the protection of sensitive information and the prevention of abuse of the discovery process."

The judge will carefully determine which instructions to give and often will \nuse a set of pattern instructions provided by the state bar association or the supreme court of the state. \nThese pattern jury instructions are often safer because they are patterned after language that appellate \ncourts have used previously, and appellate courts are less likely to find reversible error in the instructions. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n115 \nAfter all instructions are given, the jury will retire to a private room and discuss the case and the answers \nrequested by the judge for as long as it takes to reach a unanimous verdict. Some minor cases do not \nrequire a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a decision, this is called a hung jury, and the case \nwill have to be retried. When a jury does reach a verdict, it delivers it in court with both parties and their \nlawyers present. The jury is then discharged, and control over the case returns to the judge. (If there is no \njury, the judge will usually announce in a written opinion his findings of fact and how the law applies to \nthose facts. Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is. If it is favorable to the \nparty the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can \ngrant the motion for judgment n.o.v. This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on \nappeal, a new trial is not necessary. The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury \nverdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case \nmust be presented to a new jury. Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") illustrates the \njudgment n.o.v. process in a case where the judge allowed the case to go to a jury that was overly \nsympathetic to the plaintiffs. \nRule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the authorization for federal judges making a \njudgment contrary to the judgment of the jury.

In contrast, a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) is requested after the jury has reached its decision, challenging the jury's verdict based on the application of the law to the facts. If a judge grants a JNOV, it means the judge believes the jury's verdict was incorrect, and the judge will issue a new ruling in favor of the moving party. A JNOV is generally safer for the judge because if reversed on appeal, a new trial may not be required, while a directed verdict would necessitate a new trial if the appellate court disagrees with the judge's decision."

The court does not hear new evidence or witness testimony but instead relies on the procedural steps taken and the arguments presented in the form of briefs prepared by the parties' lawyers. After reviewing these materials, the appellate court may either resolve the appeal without further argument, issuing a written opinion, or hear oral arguments where each lawyer is given a limited time to present their case, often interrupted by questions from the judges.

Trial courts conduct trials where they hear live testimony, witness statements, and evidence, and then render a verdict based on the facts presented. In contrast, appellate courts do not hear new evidence or witness testimonies. Instead, they review the trial court's proceedings through the record, which consists of the trial transcript, evidence, and other documents. Appellate courts focus on legal errors rather than factual determinations, and their role is to ensure that the legal processes followed during the trial were correct. They do not take specific actions in the case but rather provide guidance to the lower court. If the appellate court finds legal errors, it can affirm the lower court's judgment, modify it, reverse it, or send it back for a retrial (remand). This distinction highlights the fundamental difference between fact-finding in trial courts and the law interpretation and application in appellate courts."

Firstly, arbitration is favored under both federal and state laws, meaning that if one party demands arbitration, the other party cannot bypass this process and must comply.

Secondly, the arbitrator's decision is typically final and binding, with very few exceptions, such as instances of fraud or the arbitrator's manifest disregard of the law. It is crucial to understand that once a final, binding arbitral award is made, it can be enforced through the courts, and subsequent litigation is generally not permitted.

These programs rely on the broad interpretation of the commerce clause to justify their existence and regulate various aspects of economic life. Additionally, other powers granted to Congress under the Constitution, such as the power to tax and spend for the general welfare, would need to be reevaluated and potentially reinterpreted within this narrower framework. This shift would significantly curtail the federal government's ability to intervene in local and intrastate matters, fundamentally altering the balance of power between the states and the federal government."

The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV.

The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States.

Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power.

                    "answer": "The key differences between independent agencies and executive branch agencies lie in their appointment processes and the degree of political control they face. Independent agencies have commissioners who are appointed with staggered terms and often for longer durations than typical four-year presidential terms. These commissioners cannot be removed by the president except for 'good cause,' ensuring that most presidents will not be able to appoint all the commissioners of an independent agency. Furthermore, these agencies typically require bipartisan membership, preventing the president from filling vacancies solely with members of his own political party. On the other hand, members of executive branch agencies serve at the pleasure of the president, making them more susceptible to political influence. This difference impacts the review process of the rules these agencies create; independent agencies' rules can only be directly overruled by Congress, while executive branch agencies' rules can be overseen by the White House or cabinet officials, unless specifically barred by legislation."

                    "answer": "Independent agencies derive their powers primarily from the original statutes that established them. For instance, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was granted licensing authority under the Federal Communications Act, which requires parties to obtain approval before engaging in certain activities, such as operating a nuclear power plant. In recent years, there has been a trend towards deregulation, leading to a reduction in licensing powers for some agencies. However, many still retain significant regulatory functions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, has broad jurisdiction over all businesses in interstate commerce to combat unfair acts and deceptive practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the issuance of corporate securities and monitors stock exchange practices. Both agencies play crucial roles in maintaining market integrity and consumer protection."

Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes.

This burden arises from the extensive record-keeping and reporting requirements that agencies impose on corporations. These requirements can be costly and time-consuming, potentially diverting resources away from core business activities. The text provides an example of the paperwork burden associated with licensing a single nuclear power plant, which can cost upward of $15 million. This high cost underscores the substantial financial impact that regulatory compliance can have on businesses, especially those operating in highly regulated industries. Such burdens can lead to increased operational costs, reduced efficiency, and potential delays in business operations, thereby affecting the overall competitiveness of businesses in the market."

First, government agencies have to review large volumes of documents to determine which ones can be disclosed and which need to be redacted or withheld. This process can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Additionally, agencies may face resource constraints, such as limited staff or funding, which can slow down the processing of requests.

                    "answer": "Barlow's is making the argument that the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures, does not provide an exception for federal agents to conduct warrantless searches of a place of business without justification, such as noncompliance with OSHA standards observed by an employee. This means that even if an employee notices noncompliance with OSHA regulations, it does not automatically grant federal agents the authority to enter a restricted business and perform a warrantless search, especially when the business is not open to the public."

By recognizing this distinction, the court allows for tailored regulatory measures that can address unique risks and hazards present in these industries, while still respecting the Fourth Amendment rights of workers and employers. This approach balances the need for effective regulation with the protection of individual rights, ensuring that the stringent standards of the Fourth Amendment are maintained even in the face of close governmental oversight."

Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal.

For instance, if a person has the intention to commit a crime but does not follow through with the act, they do not commit a crime due to the lack of an actus reus. Similarly, if a person commits a crime under duress or coercion, such as being threatened with a gun, they might not be held criminally responsible because the criminal intent was absent or overridden by the external pressure."

                    "answer": "Felonies and misdemeanors are distinguished primarily based on the severity of the offense and the corresponding punishment. Felonies are serious crimes that typically involve acts punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or even death, depending on the jurisdiction. These crimes often include violent offenses like murder, rape, and kidnapping, as well as non-violent but still serious offenses such as armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. The classification of a crime as a felony is usually established by statute and reflects the gravity of the offense. On the other hand, misdemeanors are less severe crimes, usually carrying penalties of less than one year in jail, fines, or both. Petty offenses and infractions are generally even lesser crimes, often involving minor violations that may result in small fines or warnings. The distinction between these categories helps courts and legal systems determine appropriate sentencing and reflect the societal impact of different types of criminal behavior."

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron.

                    "answer": "Pleading 'nolo contendere' in specific criminal cases allows a defendant to neither affirm nor deny their guilt. While they may still receive a sentence similar to a guilty plea, this option provides a way for defendants to avoid using a criminal conviction or guilty plea as proof of liability in subsequent civil actions. For instance, in antitrust law violations, private plaintiffs can use a criminal conviction or guilty plea to establish liability without needing to present additional evidence, whereas a no contest plea requires the plaintiff to prove both liability and damages in a civil trial."

The right to counsel is much broader in this country, as the \nresult of Supreme Court decisions that require the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in \nmost criminal cases. \n \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \nPunishment under the common law was frequently horrifying. Death was a common punishment for \nrelatively minor crimes. In many places throughout the world, punishments still persist that seem cruel \nand unusual, such as the practice of stoning someone to death. The guillotine, famously in use during and \nafter the French Revolution, is no longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display and \nhumiliation. In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky defendant who found himself convicted could face \nbrutal torture before death. \n \nThe Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the words that “cruel and unusual punishments [shall \nnot be] inflicted.” Virtually all such punishments either never were enacted or have been eliminated from \nthe statute books in the United States. Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of \ncontroversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied \nin the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.

Defendants \nmisconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses. Stated in a different form, their \nargument is that although the complainant has parted with his cash, a bank check, and a second \nmortgage, the defendants intend to repay the loan. \n \nDefendants admit that the proposition of law which they assert is a novel one in this jurisdiction. \nRespectable authority in other states persuades us that their contention is without merit. A creditor has a \nright to determine for himself whether he wishes to be a secured or an unsecured creditor. In the former \ncase, he has a right to know about the security.

                    "answer": "The court rejects the defendants' argument that Pivowar was not deprived of his property permanently because the crime of false pretenses is concerned with protecting one's title interest rather than a possessory interest. The defendants misconceive the elements of the crime of false pretenses by focusing on the intention to repay the loan, which is irrelevant to the definition of the crime. The court distinguishes between theft by larceny and false pretenses by noting that the former aims to protect a person’s possessory interest in property, while the latter focuses on protecting one’s title interest. This distinction is significant because it means that the requirement of a permanent deprivation is more appropriate for larceny, whereas false pretenses do not necessitate such a requirement. The court holds that an intent to repay a loan obtained through false pretenses is not a valid defense, affirming that the intentional act of deception by the debtor constitutes an intent to defraud, regardless of repayment intentions."

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment.

In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country.

For example, if the plaintiff has sustained a $100,000 \ninjury and is 20 percent responsible, the defendant will be liable for $80,000 in damages. \n \nAssumption of Risk \nRisk of injury pervades the modern world, and plaintiffs should not win a lawsuit simply because they \ntook a risk and lost. The law provides, therefore, that when a person knowingly takes a risk, he or she \nmust suffer the consequences. \n \nThe assumption of risk doctrine comes up in three ways. The plaintiff may have formally agreed with the \ndefendant before entering a risky situation that he will relieve the defendant of liability should injury \noccur. (“You can borrow my car if you agree not to sue me if the brakes fail, because they’re worn and I \nhaven’t had a chance to replace them.”) Or the plaintiff may have entered into a relationship with the \ndefendant knowing that the defendant is not in a position to protect him from known risks (the fan who is \nhit by a line drive in a ballpark). Or the plaintiff may act in the face of a risky situation known in advance \nto have been created by the defendant’s negligence (failure to leave, while there was an opportunity to do \nso, such as getting into an automobile when the driver is known to be drunk). \n \nThe difficulty in many cases is to determine the dividing line between subjectivity and objectivity.

It can be formalized through an agreement where the plaintiff accepts liability in exchange for the use of something potentially hazardous, such as borrowing a car with known issues. Alternatively, it applies when the plaintiff knowingly enters a situation with known risks, like attending a baseball game aware of the inherent danger of flying balls. Additionally, it can occur when the plaintiff chooses to engage in a risky activity created by the defendant's negligence, such as entering a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver. The application of this doctrine often hinges on subjective and objective standards; courts may consider community knowledge and whether the plaintiff had actual awareness of the risk. However, in situations where the plaintiff has no real choice, such as when a landlord negligently fails to illuminate an exit, assumption of risk cannot serve as a defense. The key factor is determining the line between subjective perception and objective reality in understanding the risk involved."

If a force of nature caused the harm, \nthen the defendant was not negligent in the first place. A marina, obligated to look after boats moored at \nits dock, is not liable if a sudden and fierce storm against which no precaution was possible destroys \nsomeone’s vessel. However, if it is foreseeable that harm will flow from a negligent condition triggered by \na natural event, then there is liability.

The plaintiff \nrecovered damages against the company because the negligence consisted in the failure to guard against \nany one of a number of chance occurrences that could ignite the gas. [3] \n \nVicarious Liability \nLiability for negligent acts does not always end with the one who was negligent. Under certain \ncircumstances, the liability is imputed to others. For example, an employer is responsible for the \nnegligence of his employees if they were acting in the scope of employment.

So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others.

For instance, if a work crew fails to remove explosive gas from an oil barge, and a lightning strike subsequently causes an explosion, the company may be held liable due to its negligence in failing to prevent potential hazards that could lead to accidents, even though the actual ignition was due to an unforeseeable act of nature."

                    "answer": "In the Pellman v. McDonald's Corp. case, the main argument made by the defense was that high levels of cholesterol, fat, salt, and sugar in McDonald's food were well-known to consumers, and thus, consumers could not blame McDonald's if they chose to consume large amounts of their products despite knowing the potential health risks. The court stated, 'If consumers know (or reasonably should know) the potential ill health effects of eating at McDonald’s, they cannot blame McDonald’s if they, nonetheless, choose to satiate their appetite with a surfeit of supersized McDonald’s products.' This defense relies on the assumption that consumers are knowledgeable and responsible for their own actions regarding health risks."

                    "question": "In the context of negligence, how does the 'risk reasonably to be perceived' influence the duty to be obeyed?",
                    "answer": "The 'risk reasonably to be perceived' plays a crucial role in determining the duty of care that an individual or entity must adhere to. This principle means that the likelihood of harm or damage must be considered in light of what a reasonable person would anticipate under similar circumstances. Essentially, if a person or organization can foresee a potential risk to others, they have a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to prevent that risk from materializing. For example, in the case of operating a speedway or a race course, the inherent risks are widely understood and accepted, thus the duty of care is less stringent compared to situations where unforeseen dangers could arise, such as shooting a missile or launching fireworks. The perception of risk is subjective and depends on the specific context and the actions of those involved. However, once a risk is identified, the duty to mitigate that risk becomes clear, even if the path the destructive force takes is not entirely predictable."

In such scenarios, the person or entity responsible for the act may not always be relieved of liability, even if the path the destructive force took was unexpected. The concept of 'negligence' comes into play here, which is defined in terms of the natural or probable consequences of an act. The key point is that if the harm was not intentional, the injured party must demonstrate that the act posed a significant and obvious danger, making it necessary to protect oneself from it. This means that the injured party must prove that the act had 'possibilities of danger so many and apparent as to entitle him to be protected against the doing of it,' even if the harm was unintended. In other words, the responsible party must have foreseen the potential for harm and taken appropriate precautions to prevent it, thereby fulfilling their duty of care. If these conditions are met, the responsible party may still face legal consequences, even if the exact outcome was unforeseeable."

The rocket exploded near a crowd of onlookers, including Danny Klein. Klein’s clothing was \nset on fire, and he suffered facial burns and serious injury to his eyes. Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages. The public display of fireworks fits this \ndefinition. The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created. That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be \nmisdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence. The \ncourt rejected this argument, stating, “Even if negligence may properly be regarded as an intervening \ncause, it cannot function to relieve Pyrodyne from strict liability.” \n \nThe Washington Supreme Court held that the public display of fireworks is an abnormally dangerous \nactivity that warrants the imposition of strict liability. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Certain activities are deemed ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous because they pose a high risk of causing severe harm or damage to people or property. These activities typically involve the use of highly volatile substances, complex machinery, or situations where human error can lead to catastrophic consequences. For instance, the public display of fireworks, as seen in the case, involves launching rockets into the air with the intent of creating explosions in the presence of large crowds. This creates a substantial risk of serious personal injury or property damage due to potential malfunctions or misdirections. By imposing strict liability, the law aims to ensure that those responsible for these activities have adequate incentives to take all necessary precautions to prevent accidents, thereby protecting the public from the inherent risks associated with such activities."

                    "answer": "Klein's remedy should not be limited to the Chinese manufacturer even if the fireworks were negligently manufactured there. The court's decision in this case highlights that strict liability applies when an abnormally dangerous activity causes harm, regardless of whether the harm was caused by a specific negligent act. In this scenario, the public display of fireworks was considered an abnormally dangerous activity, and the court ruled that Pyrodyne, the entity conducting the display, is strictly liable for the resulting injuries. This means that Klein can seek compensation from Pyrodyne directly, irrespective of the manufacturer's negligence. The court's rejection of Pyrodyne's argument underscores the principle that strict liability does not depend on the existence of an intervening cause of negligence; rather, it focuses on the defendant's role in the abnormally dangerous activity. Therefore, Klein has the right to pursue a claim against Pyrodyne for his injuries, ensuring that he receives the necessary compensation without being restricted to the manufacturer alone."

Briney case had allowed the floor to rot until it became dangerously weak, leading to injury, they would still likely face liability under premises liability law. The fact that they did not actively set a trap but allowed a hazardous condition to exist over a period of time means they could be considered negligent in maintaining safe conditions. The status of the visitor—whether they are a trespasser, licensee, or invitee—would significantly impact the defendant's liability. Trespassers generally have limited protection under tort law, while licensees and invitees are owed a higher duty of care.

First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions.

For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises.

                    "question": "What distinguishes an express contract from other types of contracts mentioned?",
                    "answer": "An express contract stands out because its terms are explicitly stated, either in writing or through direct verbal communication between the parties involved. The parties are fully aware of the terms and understand that this agreement can be legally enforced. For instance, an agreement where you decide to buy your neighbor's car for $500 with the stipulation that the transfer of ownership occurs next Monday is a classic example of an express contract. This clarity in terms sets it apart from implied contracts and quasi-contracts, where the existence of a contract may be inferred from the actions or circumstances of the parties, rather than explicit statements."

The carpenter starts working, and the homeowner, unaware of the mistake, allows the work to continue. Despite the absence of an actual contract, the law imposes a quasi-contract to prevent the carpenter from being unjustly enriched at the homeowner's expense. Essentially, the court infers a contract based on the value of the work performed, ensuring that the carpenter is compensated for his labor. This legal fiction operates to avoid situations where one party could benefit unfairly from another's services without providing compensation, thereby maintaining a fair balance in transactions."

That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard.

The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment.

For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

A common scenario for this type of arrangement is a literary or author's agent, who agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a percentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work.

Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks.

                    "answer": "The classification of an individual as either an independent contractor or a servant can have significant implications for their legal standing and responsibilities. An employee (servant) is considered an agent of the employer and is subject to the employer's control over their work, which includes taxation, workers' compensation, and liability insurance. Employers must withhold income taxes from employees' paychecks and provide them with workers' compensation coverage if they get injured on the job. Additionally, employers are typically responsible for providing health and safety protections and ensuring compliance with labor laws. In contrast, an independent contractor is legally autonomous and is not subject to the same level of control by the hiring party. This means that they are responsible for their own taxes, workers' compensation, and other insurance needs. They may also face different liability considerations, as they are not covered by the employer's insurance policies in the event of accidents or disputes related to their work."

But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home.

Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees.

The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare.

Implied authority implies that an agent has the authority to perform acts that are incidental to or reasonably necessary for carrying out the specific transaction for which they have express authority. This means that while the principal might not have explicitly stated that the agent could perform certain tasks, the nature of their work and the context of their interaction with third parties can imply such authority. This is particularly important in business situations where rapid decision-making and quick actions are often required, and formal authorization cannot always be obtained in time.

The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison.

[2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers.

It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. We consider each situation. \n \nAgent for Undisclosed or Partially Disclosed Principal \nAn agent need not, and frequently will not, inform the person with whom he is negotiating that he is \nacting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a",

This can affect liability in a contract because under these circumstances, the agent might be held liable for the contract if the other party is unaware of the principal's existence or identity. For instance, in the hypothetical example provided, Betty and Clem act as undisclosed and partially disclosed agents respectively, meaning they could potentially be held liable for the contracts they enter into if the landowners later discover the true identity of the principal."

We therefore \nreverse the judgment. \n \nFor approximately ten years prior to 1975, Harold Kanavos and his brother borrowed money on at least \ntwenty occasions from the Hancock Bank & Trust Company (the Bank), and, during that period, the loan \nofficer with whom Kanavos always dealt was James M.

                    "answer": "The partnership act functions as the 'default position' because it provides a set of rules and regulations that govern partnerships in the absence of a specific partnership agreement. This means that if partners do not establish a detailed partnership agreement, the law will automatically apply these default rules. UPA and RUPA are particularly important for general partnerships, as they offer a comprehensive framework for defining the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of partners. These acts cover various aspects such as partnership formation, management, profits and losses, and dissolution, making them indispensable for ensuring clarity and fairness among partners in a general partnership setting."

And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

Moreover, the name is potentially deceptive since it suggests affiliation with an existing business, which could mislead customers and the public. Additionally, the name would likely violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states, as these typically require businesses to register their chosen names along with the names and addresses of the proprietors in some public office. If the business fails to comply with these registration requirements, it might face difficulties in enforcing its contracts or filing lawsuits due to non-compliance with state regulations."

The tenancy by the entirety and community property (in community-property states) forms of \nownership are limited to spouses, and their effects are similar to that of joint tenancy. \n \nSuppose a husband and wife who own their home as tenants by the entirety (or community property) \ndecide to spend the summer at the seashore and rent their home for three months. Is their co-ownership \nsufficient to establish that they are partners? The answer is no. By UPA Section 7(2) and RUPA Section \n202(b)(1), the various forms of joint ownership by themselves do not establish partnership, whether or \nnot the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property. To establish a partnership, the ownership \nmust be of a business, not merely of property. \n \nSharing of Profits \nThere are two aspects to consider with regard to profits: first, whether the business is for-profit, and \nsecond, whether there is a sharing of the profit. \n \nBusiness for Profit \nUnincorporated nonprofit organizations (UNAs) cannot be partnerships. The paucity of coherent law \ngoverning these organizations gave rise in 2005 to the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform \nLaws’ promulgation of the Revised Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (RUUNAA). The \nprefatory note to this act says, “RUUNAA was drafted with small informal associations in mind.

Of the tests used by courts to determine co-ownership, \nperhaps the most important is sharing of profits.

This is because the nature of the ownership must be of a business, rather than merely of property, to qualify as a partnership.

Joint venturers are fiduciaries toward one another. \nAlthough no formality is necessary, the associates will usually sign an agreement. The joint venture need have no \ngroup name, though it may have one. Property may be owned jointly. Profits and losses will be shared, as in a \npartnership, and each associate has the right to participate in management. Liability is unlimited. Sometimes two \nor more businesses will form a joint venture to carry out a specific task—prospecting for oil, building a nuclear \nreactor, doing basic scientific research—and will incorporate the joint venture. In that case, the resulting \nbusiness—known as a “joint venture corporation”—is governed by corporation law, not the law of partnership, \nand is not a joint venture in the sense described here. Increasingly, companies are forming joint ventures to do \nbusiness abroad; foreign investors or governments own significant interests in these joint ventures. For example, \nin 1984 General Motors entered into a joint venture with Toyota to revive GM’s shuttered Fremont, California, \nassembly plant to create New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). For GM the joint venture was an \nopportunity to learn about lean manufacturing from the Japanese company, while Toyota gained its first \nmanufacturing base in North America and a chance to test its production system in an American labor \nenvironment. Until May 2010, when the copartnership ended and the plant closed, NUMMI built an average of six \nthousand vehicles a week, or nearly eight million cars and trucks. These vehicles were the Chevrolet Nova (1984–\n88), the Geo Prizm (1989–97), the Chevrolet Prizm (1998–2002), and the Hilux (1991–95, predecessor of the \nTacoma), as well as the Toyota Voltz, the Japanese right-hand-drive version of the Pontiac Vibe.

However, if two or more businesses form a joint venture to carry out a specific task and incorporate the joint venture, then the resulting business becomes subject to corporation law, and the liability is limited to the assets of the corporation.

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv.

Firstly, it mentions the unusual inclusion of specific working hours and days off in the agreement, which is typically not found in partnership documents. Secondly, it notes that the barbers contributed only the necessary equipment, akin to what all barber shop operators would provide, rather than bringing in unique or specialized assets that would be expected in a true partnership. Lastly, the text points out that the agreement did not establish a shared ownership or profit-sharing arrangement, which is essential for a partnership. These factors collectively suggest an employer-employee relationship rather than a partnership, as the barbers were essentially treated like employees with specific working conditions and no shared business risk or reward."

This doctrine is significant because it can lead to individuals being held liable for debts even if they are not formal partners in a business. In this case, despite the Chavers brothers maintaining that CWC was a sole proprietorship and they were merely employees, the court found that Epsco believed CWC was a partnership due to the actions and representations made by Gary, the father. This belief by Epsco, combined with the brothers' conduct, led to the application of partnership by estoppel, resulting in the brothers being held personally liable for the company's debt.

Partners are fiduciaries as \nto each other and as to the partnership, and as such, they owe a fiduciary duty to each other and the \npartnership. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, in an often-quoted phrase, called the fiduciary duty “something \nstricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most \nsensitive, is then the standard of behavior.” [3]Breach of the fiduciary duty gives rise to a claim for \ncompensatory, consequential, and incidental damages; recoupment of compensation; and—rarely—\npunitive damages. See Section 12.4.1 \"Breach of Partnership Fiduciary Duty\", Gilroy v. Conway, for an \nexample of breach of fiduciary duty. \n \n \nApplication of the Fiduciary Standard to Partnership Law \nUnder UPA, all partners are fiduciaries of each other—they are all principals and agents of each other—\nthough the word fiduciary was not used except in the heading to Section 21. The section reads, “Every \npartner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by \nhim without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, \nconduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property.” \n \nSection 404 of RUPA specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other \npartners. It imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three circumstances: \n \n(1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived \nby the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use \nby the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership \nopportunity; \n \n(2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership \nbusiness as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n494 \n(3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business \nbefore the dissolution of the partnership.",

This duty is stricter than the morals of the market place, and it is often compared to the 'punctilio of an honor the most sensitive.' Breach of this fiduciary duty can lead to claims for compensatory, consequential, and incidental damages, recoupment of compensation, and rarely punitive damages. Under Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), every partner is considered a fiduciary of each other and an agent of each other, though the term 'fiduciary' is only used in the heading to Section 21. Section 21 states that every partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners from any transaction connected with the formation, conduct, or liquidation of the partnership or from any use by him of its property. According to Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), Section 404 specifically provides that a partner has a fiduciary duty to the partnership and other partners, and imposes the fiduciary standard on the duty of loyalty in three specific circumstances: (1) to account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity; (2) to refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and (3) to refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership."

This underscores the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities within the partnership, especially when a partner is absent and unable to perform her duties.

The liability is a loan owing to the \npartner by the firm. \nRight to Return of Capital Contribution \nWhen a partner joins a partnership, she is expected to make a capital contribution to the firm; this may be \ndeducted from her share of the distributed profit and banked by the firm in its capital account. The law \nprovides that “the partnership must reimburse a partner for an advance of funds beyond the amount of \nthe partner’s agreed capital contribution, thereby treating the advance as a loan.” [10] A partner may get a \nreturn of capital under UPA after creditors are paid off if the business is wound down and terminated. [11] \n \nRight to Compensation \nSection 401(d) of RUPA provides that “a partner is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for \nthe partnership, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of \nthe partnership”; UPA Section 18(f) is to the same effect. A partner gets his money from the firm by \nsharing the profits, not by a salary or wages. \n \nRight to Management \nAll partners are entitled to share equally in the management and conduct of the business, unless the \npartnership agreement provides otherwise. [12] The partnership agreement could be structured to delegate \nmore decision-making power to one class of partners (senior partners) than to others (junior partners), or \nit may give more voting weight to certain individuals. For example, perhaps those with the most \nexperience will, for the first four years after a new partner is admitted, have more voting weight than the \nnew partner. \n \nRight to Choose Partners \nA business partnership is often analogized to a marriage partnership.

The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner.

Under this rule, the partners act as guarantors of the partnership's liabilities. On the other hand, UPA, which is Section 13, states that contract liability is joint only, not also several. This implies that partners must be sued together in a single lawsuit, and a partner who was not initially named in the lawsuit cannot be sued separately by a creditor.

This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.)

In his classic textbook Economics, Professor Paul Samuelson observed that unlimited \nliability “reveals why partnerships tend to be confined to small, personal enterprises.…When it becomes a \nquestion of placing their personal fortunes in jeopardy, people are reluctant to put their capital into \ncomplex ventures over which they can exercise little control.…In the field of investment banking, concerns \nlike JPMorgan Chase used to advertise proudly ‘not incorporated’ so that their creditors could have extra \nassurance. But even these concerns have converted themselves into corporate entities.” [8] \n \nPartners’ Personal Liability for Torts \nOf course, a person is always liable for his own torts. All partners are also liable for any partner’s tort \ncommitted in the scope of partnership business under agency law, and this liability is—again—personal \nand unlimited, subject to RUPA’s requirement that the judgment creditor exhaust the partnership’s assets \nbefore going after the separate assets of the partners.

Under this theory, the partnership's income is not taxed at the entity level; instead, it passes through to the partners, who then pay taxes on their share of the income. This means that the partnership itself does not pay any income tax, and the partners only pay tax on their individual shares of the partnership's income. In contrast, corporate income is taxed at both the corporate level and the shareholder level when distributed as dividends, resulting in double taxation. Thus, the partnership form allows for a more efficient flow of income and reduces the overall tax burden on the partners."

Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues.

Statutes typically provide that any obligation of the partnership, whether contractual or tortious, is solely the responsibility of the partnership itself, and individual partners are not personally liable for such obligations. However, the statutes vary in terms of the extent of this protection. Early statutes provided limited liability primarily for negligent acts, but left unlimited liability for other acts such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts. Subsequent statutes expanded this protection to cover all acts except breaches of ordinary contractual obligations, known as partial shield statutes. More recently, some states have adopted full shield statutes, which eliminate all grounds for unlimited liability. Despite these differences, most statutes still require partners to maintain professional malpractice insurance and hold individuals fully accountable for their own negligence or for the wrongful acts of supervised personnel within the LLP."

Additionally, if a member or manager acts after the dissolution of the LLC, they can be held liable for debts if the act is not appropriate for winding up the company's business or causes damage to the company.

                    "answer": "No, if Topel's business had been a corporation, he would not have had the same insulation from liability for post-dissolution contracts. In the context of corporations, shareholders generally have limited liability, meaning they are not personally responsible for the company's debts and obligations after it has been dissolved. This differs from LLCs where members typically have limited liability, but there can be exceptions or specific circumstances that might pierce the corporate veil. Therefore, in the scenario where Topel’s business was a corporation, he would have been liable for any post-dissolution contracts, unlike the situation with the LLC where the court found no personal liability for Topel due to the clear statutory language that protects LLC members from such liabilities."

Although the current LLC act language is similar to the Model Business Corporation Act, which permits piercing, the court was bound by the explicit provisions of the LLC Act. In this case, the court found that the Act does not authorize the piercing of the LLC shield for personal liability to third parties for an LLC’s debts and liabilities. This decision was made even though the plaintiffs argued that the circuit court’s ruling did not provide an equitable result.

The general \npartner controls the firm and is liable like a partner in a general partnership (except under ULPA-2001 \nliability is limited); the limited partners are investors and have little say in the daily operations of the \nfirm. If they get too involved, they lose their status as limited partners (except this is not so under ULPA-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n580 \n2001). The general partner, though, can be a corporation, which finesses the liability problem. A limited \npartnership comes into existence only when a certificate of limited partnership is filed with the state. \n \nIn the mid-twentieth century, Congress was importuned to allow small corporations the benefit of pass-\nthrough taxation.

These laws were crafted with the intention of ensuring transparency and accountability within corporate structures. For instance, corporations were required to provide detailed information about their operations, finances, and management to regulatory bodies. Additionally, the concept of limited liability was introduced to shield individual shareholders from personal financial responsibility beyond their investment in the company. The rationale behind these laws was to foster a stable and predictable business environment, reduce the risk of fraud and exploitation, and promote public trust in corporate entities. By imposing these stringent regulations, lawmakers aimed to balance the benefits of corporate organization against potential risks and ensure that corporations operated ethically and responsibly, thereby contributing positively to the broader economy and society."

In 1881, when Jennie McGraw left a substantial bequest to the university, including a carillon and a residuary estate valued at over $1 million, the university encountered a problem because this sum exceeded the ceiling set in their charter. As a result, the university had to engage in lengthy litigation, ultimately losing the case in the US Supreme Court. This outcome led to the university losing a considerable sum of money that went to McGraw's family instead. This incident highlights the critical challenge in drafting the corporate purpose clause: the clause must be broad enough to allow the corporation to adapt and grow but specific enough to prevent it from engaging in activities that might be deemed undesirable or illegal. The dilemma arises from the need to balance flexibility and specificity, ensuring the corporation has the freedom to pursue various opportunities while maintaining a clear boundary against potential missteps."

                    "answer": "Whether taking out a loan is good advice depends on various factors such as the purpose of the loan, the borrower's financial situation, and the terms of the loan. If the loan is used to finance a profitable venture or to cover essential expenses, it can be beneficial. However, if the loan is taken out without a clear plan to repay it or if the interest rates are high, it can become risky and lead to financial strain. The decision to take out a loan should be based on careful planning and understanding of the potential risks and benefits."

                    "answer": "Before the corporation formally accepts the contract entered into by Laverne, she would typically be personally liable for the obligations under the contract. This is because, prior to the corporation's acceptance, the contract would be considered Laverne's personal obligation. Once the corporation accepts the contract, it becomes the corporation's liability, not Laverne's. This shift in liability means that after acceptance, Laverne is no longer personally liable for the contract unless she acted outside the scope of her authority or there was some other legal reason for her personal liability to persist. The formal acceptance by the corporation is a critical step in establishing the corporation as the party bound by the contract and relieving individual officers like Laverne of personal responsibility for the contract's obligations."

In modern usage, the two terms are used interchangeably, as we will do here. \nShares in closely held corporations are often identical: each share of stock in BCT Bookstore, Inc. carries \nwith it the same right to vote, to receive dividends, and to receive a distribution of the net assets of the \ncompany upon liquidation. Many large corporations do not present so simple a picture. Large \ncorporations may have many different types of stock: different classes of common stock, preferred stock, \nstock with par value and no-par stock, voting and nonvoting stock, outstanding stock, and treasury stock. \nTo find out which types of stock a company has issued, look at the shareholders’ (or stockholders’) equity \nsection of the company’s balance sheet. \n \nAuthorized, Issued, and Outstanding Stock \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n637 \nStocks have different designations depending on who holds them. The articles of incorporation spell out \nhow many shares of stock the corporation may issue: these are its authorized shares. The corporation \nis not obliged to issue all authorized shares, but it may not issue more than the total without amending the \narticles of incorporation. The total of stock sold to investors is the issued stock of the corporation; the \nissued stock in the hands of all shareholders is called outstanding stock. \n \nPar Value and No-Par Stock \nPar value is the face value of stock. Par value, though, is not the market value; it is a value placed on the \nstock by the corporation but has little to do with the buying and selling value of that stock on the open \nmarket. \n \nWhen a value is specified on a stock certificate, it is said to be par value. Par value is established in the \narticles of incorporation and is the floor price of the stock; the corporation may not accept less than par \nvalue for the stock. \n \nCompanies in most states can also issue no-par shares. No-par stock may be sold for whatever price is set \nby the board of directors or by the market—unless the shareholders themselves are empowered to \nestablish the price.

However, preferred stock \nusually has a par value, which is useful in determining dividend and liquidation rights. \n \nThe term stated capital describes the sum of the par value of the issued par value stock and the \nconsideration received (or stated value) for the no-par stock. The excess of net assets of a corporation over \nstated capital is its surplus. Surplus is divided into earned surplus (essentially the company’s retained \nearnings) and capital surplus (all surpluses other than earned surplus). We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock. Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt). Thus corporations issue preferred stock to attract more conservative investors: common \nstock is riskier than preferred stock, so corporations can attract more investors if they have both preferred \nand common stock. \n \nPreference to Dividends \nA dividend is a payment made to stockholders from corporate profits. Assume that one class of preferred \nstock is entitled to a 7 percent dividend. The percentage applies to the par value; if par value is $100, each \nshare of preferred is entitled to a dividend of $7 per year. Assuming the articles of incorporation say so, \nthis 7 percent preferred stock has preference over other classes of shares for dividend payments. \n \nLiquidation Preference \nAn additional right of preferred shareholders is the right to share in the distribution of assets in the event \nof liquidation, after having received assets under a liquidation preference—that is, a preference, according \nto a predetermined formula, to receive the assets of the company on liquidation ahead of other classes of \nshareholders. \n \nConvertible Shares",

Note: The business judgment \nrule, generally summarized, is that the directors are presumed to act in the best interest of the \ncorporation and its shareholders and to fulfill their fiduciary duties of good faith, loyalty, and due care. \nThe burden is on the plaintiff to prove that a transaction was so one sided that no business person of \nordinary judgment would conclude that the transaction was proper and/or fair. \n \n \n \n \n15.8 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nCorporations finance through a variety of mechanisms. One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock.

An advantage of preferred stock is that it provides a fixed dividend payment, which can be beneficial for attracting investors who seek stable income. Preferred stockholders also typically have priority over common stockholders in the event of liquidation, meaning they would receive their investment back before common stockholders. However, there are also disadvantages. Preferred stock often comes with restrictions on voting rights, limiting the influence of preferred stockholders in corporate decisions. Additionally, preferred stock may have a call feature, allowing the company to repurchase the shares at a predetermined price, which could be unfavorable if the company wants to maintain control. Another disadvantage is that preferred stock can be more expensive to issue due to the need to pay fixed dividends, which reduces the net proceeds available to the company.

The corporation itself has powers, although \nwith limitations. There is a division of power between shareholders, directors, and officers. Given \nthis division of power, certain duties are owed amongst the parties. We focus this chapter upon these \npowers and upon the duties owed by shareholders, directors, and officers.

Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow",

A corporation may exercise all express powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation, such as the ability to sue and be sued in the corporate name, to purchase, use, and sell land and dispose of assets, and to make contracts and borrow money. However, unlike a natural person, a corporation cannot be put in prison for its actions. Instead, it is granted certain rights and allowed to conduct specific activities as defined by law and its articles of incorporation."

Furthermore, RMBCA Section 3.04 states that “the validity of corporate action may not be \nchallenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act.” \n \nNonetheless, ultra vires acts are still challenged in courts today. For example, particularly in the area of \nenvironmental law, plaintiffs are challenging corporate environmental actions as ultra vires. Delaware \ncorporation law states that the attorney general shall revoke the charter of a corporation for illegal acts. \nAdditionally, the Court of Chancery of Delaware has jurisdiction to forfeit or revoke a corporate charter \nfor abuse of corporate powers. [1] See Adam Sulkowski’s “Ultra Vires Statutes: Alive, Kicking, and a Means \nof Circumventing the Scalia Standing Gauntlet.” [2] \n \nIn essence, ultra vires retains force in three circumstances: \n \n1. Shareholders may bring suits against the corporation to enjoin it from acting beyond its powers. \n2. The corporation itself, through receivers, trustees, or shareholders, may sue incumbent or former \nofficers or directors for causing the corporation to act ultra vires. \n3.

They raise special problems, to which we now turn. \n \nCriminal, Tortious, and Other Illegal Acts \nThe early common law held that a corporation could not commit a crime because it did not have a mind \nand could not therefore have the requisite intent.

Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions.

It's important to note that while the corporation might be found guilty, company officials who authorized or carried out the illegal act can also be prosecuted and potentially sent to jail.

This assessment often involves examining the context in which the crime occurred, the nature of the employee's role, and whether there was any specific authorization or encouragement from higher-ups within the corporation to engage in illegal activities. The absence of explicit statements of criminal intent from individuals within the corporation makes this determination challenging. Courts must rely on circumstantial evidence and the totality of the circumstances to make such a judgment. If it is determined that the crime was job-related and the corporation had knowledge or should have known about the illegal activities, then the corporation can be held liable. This approach helps ensure that corporations are held accountable for the actions of their employees when those actions are closely tied to their job duties."

Under cumulative voting, \nhowever, each shareholder has as many votes as there are directors to be elected. Hence with cumulative \nvoting Bob and Carol could strategically distribute their 20,000 votes (4,000 votes multiplied by five \ndirectors) among the candidates to ensure representation on the board. By placing 10,000 votes each on \ntwo of their candidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board.

Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors.

Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors.

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female \nto lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff \nwrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either \nletter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected.

                    "answer": "The key facts presented in the Cross v. The Midtown Club, Inc. case included that the plaintiff was a member in good standing of the defendant nonstock Connecticut corporation. Each of the individual defendants was a director of the corporation, and together they constituted the entire board of directors. The certificate of incorporation set forth that the sole purpose of the corporation was 'to provide facilities for the serving of luncheon or other meals to members.' Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the bylaws of the corporation contained any qualifications for membership, nor did either contain any restrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club. The plaintiff sought to bring a female to lunch with him, and both he and his guest were refused seating at the luncheon facility. The plaintiff wrote twice to the president of the corporation to protest the action, but he received no reply to either letter. On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a different female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it then rejected. Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate polls of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative proposals for amending the bylaws of the corporation concerning the admission of women members and guests.

This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized.

The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination. We address separately those two categories and the issues that \nthey generate.… \n \n…[The due care] argument is best understood against the backdrop of the presumptions that cloak \ndirector action being reviewed under the business judgment standard. Our law presumes that “in making \na business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the \nhonest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” Those presumptions can be \nrebutted if the plaintiff shows that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or of loyalty or acted \nin bad faith. If that is shown, the burden then shifts to the director defendants to demonstrate that the \nchallenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders.… \n \nThe appellants’ first claim is that the Chancellor erroneously (i) failed to make a “threshold \ndetermination” of gross negligence, and (ii) “conflated” the appellants’ burden to rebut the business \njudgment presumptions, with an analysis of whether the directors’ conduct fell within the 8 Del. C. § \n102(b)(7) provision that precludes exculpation of directors from monetary liability “for acts or omissions \nnot in good faith.” The argument runs as follows: Emerald Partners v. Berlin required the Chancellor first \nto determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted based upon a showing that \nthe board violated its duty of care, i.e., acted with gross negligence. If gross negligence were established, \nthe burden would shift to the directors to establish that the OEA was entirely fair.

This standard presumes that directors made business decisions on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company. These presumptions can be rebutted if it is shown that the directors breached their fiduciary duty of care or loyalty, or acted in bad faith. If such a breach is demonstrated, the burden shifts to the directors to prove that the challenged act or transaction was entirely fair to the corporation and its shareholders. The case also highlighted that Emerald Partners v. Berlin mandated the Chancellor to first determine whether the business judgment rule presumptions were rebutted through a showing of gross negligence. If gross negligence was established, the burden would then shift to the directors to show that the OEA was entirely fair. Only if the directors failed to meet this burden could the trial court consider the directors' Section 102(b)(7) exculpation defense, which pertains to monetary liability for acts or omissions not in good faith."

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders.

However, these laws often conflict with one another, hindering national uniformity, and several states have recently updated or abolished their merit review provisions."

This situation involves the use of material, nonpublic information. According to federal securities laws, particularly under Rule 10b-5, it is illegal to trade on such information, as it provides an unfair advantage to the trader. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and private parties can bring suit against individuals who engage in such insider trading.

We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC.",

A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target.

First, there must be either an explicit or implicit agreement to assume the liabilities. Second, the transaction may be considered a consolidation or merger of the two corporations. Third, the purchasing corporation might be seen as merely continuing the operations of the sold corporation. Lastly, the transfer of assets to the purchaser might be done with the fraudulent intent of avoiding liability for the sold corporation's debts."

There was no evidence of an express or implied agreement to assume liability for injuries caused by defective products. Additionally, the transaction was not a consolidation or merger since Alad II provided adequate consideration, including cash and a promissory note, rather than simply taking over assets without providing resources to cover potential creditor claims. Furthermore, Alad II was not a mere continuation of Alad I, and there was no fraudulent intent to escape liability for Alad I’s debts."

The key to the success of this invention is the concept of negotiability: through \nthis process, a person can pass on—in most cases—better title to receive payment than he had; thus the \ntransferee of such paper will most likely get paid by the obligor and will not be subject to most defenses of \nany prior holders. The law of commercial paper has developed over the past four hundred years.

Recall from Section 19.1 \n\"Introduction to Commercial Paper\" that Lorna Love wished to buy tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc. \nSuppose Love had the money to pay but did not want to do so before delivery. Rackets, on the other hand, \ndid not want to ship before Love paid. The solution: a sight draft, drawn on Love, to which would be \nattached an order bill of lading that Rackets received from the trucker when it shipped the rackets. The \nsight draft and bill of lading go to a bank in Love’s city. When the tennis rackets arrive, the carrier notifies \nthe bank, which presents the draft to Love for payment. When she has done so, the bank gives Love the \nbill of lading, entitling her to receive the shipment.

This type of draft is beneficial in situations where one party needs to be paid promptly, while the other party requires more time to arrange payment. For example, if Love will not have sufficient cash to pay until after selling the rackets, but Rackets needs to be paid immediately, a time draft known as a trade acceptance can be utilized. In this scenario, Rackets draws a draft on Love, making Love the drawee. The draft instructs Love to pay the purchase price to Rackets on a predetermined date. Rackets then presents the draft to Love, who accepts it by signing her name. After accepting the draft, Rackets can endorse it by signing it and sell it, at a discount, to a bank or another financial institution.

Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\".

They claimed that this constituted a 'complete and total failure of consideration for the said promissory note.' As a result, they believed that Centerre should be estopped from asserting a claim against them on the promissory note because of such total failure of consideration for the same. This argument was based on the principle that when there is a failure of consideration, the party who received the consideration cannot enforce the contract against the other party."

The law regulating \nnegotiability is Article 3 of the Universal Commercial Code. \n \nCommercial paper can be divided into two basic types: the draft and the note. A draft is a document \nprepared by a drawer ordering the drawee to remit a stated sum of money to the payee. Drafts can be \nsubdivided into two categories: sight drafts and time drafts. A note is a written promise to pay a specified \nsum of money on demand or at a definite time. \n \nA special form of draft is the common bank check, a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand. A \nspecial form of note is the certificate of deposit, a written acknowledgment by a bank that it has received \nmoney and agrees to repay it at a time specified in the certificate. \n \nIn addition to drawers, makers, drawees, and payees, one can deal with commercial paper in five other \ncapacities: as indorsers, indorsees, holders, holders in due course, and accommodation parties. \nA holder of a negotiable instrument must be able to ascertain all essential terms from its face. These terms \nare that the instrument (1) be in writing, (2) be signed by the maker or drawer, (3) contain an \nunconditional promise or order to pay (4) a sum certain in money, (5) be payable on demand or at a \ndefinite time, and (6) be payable to order or to bearer. If one of these terms is missing, the document is \nnot negotiable, unless it is filled in before being negotiated according to authority given. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nGolf Inc. manufactures golf balls.

                    "answer": "Handwriting provides a unique signature that can be matched against the signer's known signature, making it easier to verify authenticity and prevent fraud. In contrast, printed or typed signatures can be easily replicated, posing a higher risk of forgery. This is particularly important for negotiable instruments because they are often transferred multiple times, and each recipient needs to ensure the instrument is genuine before accepting it."

This might involve obtaining a power of attorney or a letter from the rightful owner granting permission to sign on their behalf. Additionally, the plaintiff could have required the instrument to be notarized or witnessed, providing further evidence of legitimate authority. Furthermore, maintaining clear records of all transactions and authorizations would help demonstrate due diligence and minimize the risk of legal disputes."

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it.

                    "answer": "Commercial paper can be negotiated through two main types: bearer paper and order paper. Bearer paper is negotiable simply by delivering it to the transferee, as it runs to whoever is in possession of it, even a thief. However, a purchaser of bearer paper might still require an indorsement for increased liability protection. On the other hand, order paper requires the payee to indorse the instrument by signing it on the back, passing it on to the transferee. This process ensures that the instrument continues through the channels of commerce. An example of order paper negotiation involves Rackets, Inc., which indorses Lorna Love's check to an agent who then passes it to a transferee. Without proper indorsement, even if the transferee is in physical possession of the instrument, they do not qualify as a holder."

This practice is beneficial because it increases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Indorsements serve as a form of security for the purchaser, ensuring that the instrument is more likely to be honored and that the indorser will be held accountable if there are any issues with collection. This practice is particularly common when dealing with checks made out to 'cash', where the purchaser often requests their own indorsement to protect themselves against potential fraud or loss of the instrument."

In determining the liability of the parties, the Court considers various factors such as Wachovia’s policies regarding the acceptance of checks, the number of fraudulent checks, the nature of the payees, the number of employees, Lunny's role in managing the company's finances, and her knowledge of the computerized check generation process. These factors are used to allocate responsibility between the parties based on their respective levels of negligence."

For instance, instead of simply naming Chad Gill as the payee, the drawer could have specified 'Chad Gill, not negotiable' or 'Chad Gill, for deposit only.'

This means that the signature was applied by the recipient (Gill) rather than the issuer (the US government). The US government, as the drawer, did not place any conditions or restrictions on the check itself, but rather, those conditions were added by Gill himself. Therefore, the court ruled that since Gill added the restrictive language to the check and signed it, the indorsement belonged to him and not to the US government. This interpretation is crucial for understanding the legal implications of Gill's actions and the bank's responsibilities in handling the check."

Under the objective prong, a check-cashing business must act in a commercially reasonable manner to obtain holder-in-due-course status. This means that simply accepting a check in good faith (i.e., with honest intent) is no longer sufficient; the business must also adhere to reasonable commercial standards. For example, Buckeye's failure to make any attempt to verify the availability of funds on a postdated check led to the rejection of its claim to holder-in-due-course status. Therefore, check-cashing businesses must now ensure they act responsibly and in line with established commercial standards when handling checks to avoid losing their status as holder-in-due-course."

Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents.",

Since a thumbprint does not provide that information at the time presentment and payment are made, he argues that a thumbprint cannot be considered 'reasonable identification' under the statute."

They support their argument by referencing the fact that the form of identification was not defined by the statute, but the Code itself recognizes a thumbprint as a form of signature (§ 1-201(39)). Additionally, they point out that requiring thumbprint or fingerprint identification has been found to be reasonable and not to violate privacy rights in various non-criminal contexts. The intermediate appellate court agreed with this stance, noting that the form of identification was not defined by the statute and observing that such requirements have been deemed reasonable in other situations."

It was enacted in 1988 in response to complaints by \nconsumer groups about long delays before customers were allowed access to funds represented by checks \nthey had deposited. It has nothing to do with electronic transfers, although the increasing use of electronic \ntransfers does speed up the system and make it easier for banks to comply with Regulation CC. \n \nThe Act’s Provisions \nThe act provides that when a customer deposits a cashier’s check, certified check, or a check written on an \naccount in the same bank, the funds must be available by the next business day. Funds from other local \nchecks (drawn on institutions within the same Federal Reserve region) must be available within two \nworking days, while there is a maximum five-day wait for funds from out-of-town checks. In order for \nthese time limits to be effective, the customer must endorse the check in a designated space on the back \nside.

Traditionally this has been a process of physical transfer by air and ground \ntransportation from the depository bank to various intermediary banks to the payor bank where the check is \npresented. Since 2004 the Check 21 Act has encouraged a trend away from the physical transportation of \nchecks to the electronic transportation of the check’s data, which is truncated (stripped) from the paper \ninstrument and transmitted. However, if a paper instrument is required, a “substitute check” will recreate it. \nThe UCC’s Article 4 deals generally with aspects of the bank-customer relationship, including warranties on \npayment or collection of checks, payment of overdrafts, stop orders, and customers’ duties to detect \nirregularities.

For other local checks (within the same Federal Reserve region), the availability period is extended to two working days, while out-of-town checks can take up to five days for fund availability.

                    "answer": "The Expedited Funds Availability Act impacts the handling of different types of checks by establishing varying time frames for when funds from these checks become accessible to customers. Specifically, cashier's checks, certified checks, and checks drawn on the same bank must have funds available by the next business day. Local checks (drawn on institutions within the same Federal Reserve region) must be available within two working days. Conversely, out-of-town checks may require up to five days for funds to become available. This legislation ensures that banks provide timely access to funds, subject to proper endorsement of the checks in a designated area on the back side. Additionally, the act outlines the requirement for customers to endorse checks to facilitate the quicker release of funds, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized transactions and ensuring compliance with the law."

Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows.",

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking.

Further, it provides a framework for estimating value through an assessment of the timing,\nmagnitude, and risk of cash flows for long-term projects. Finance is important for more immediate activities as\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\npaychecks.\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\nof both new and old financial products.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJob Information\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you.

Financial technology has introduced innovative platforms and tools that facilitate more efficient and accessible trading. Derivative securities, such as futures, options, and swaps, allow investors to hedge risks or speculate on price movements of underlying assets. Cryptocurrencies represent a novel form of digital money that operates independently of central banks and governments. Understanding these areas is crucial because they offer both new opportunities and challenges. Investors need to be aware of the risks and benefits associated with these products to make informed decisions, ensuring that they can take advantage of potential returns while mitigating losses.

It was originally created as a quick way for stock traders to assess if the stock market had gone up or down each day and by how much. According to Table 1.1, it took from 1906 to 1972, or a little over 66 years, for the Dow 30 to increase tenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a little under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. The table also shows that the DJIA reached 20,000 on January 25, 2017, and 30,000 on November 24, 2020."

If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management.

The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors.

They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services.

It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors.

The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\nthe quality of goods changes over time.

Through this academic initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, prices are\ncollected daily from online retailers around the world.

Setting up short meetings to discuss these aspects and physically inspecting the equipment can help in collecting detailed information. Additionally, asking specific questions about the asset's performance and maintenance needs can ensure that all relevant data is captured. This collaborative approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the asset and its integration into the company's operations, facilitating accurate record-keeping and proper depreciation calculations."

The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings",

Net income is derived from the income statement and is used to update the retained earnings account on the balance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts, including revenue and expense accounts, are closed to the income summary account. This results in either a net profit or net loss being recorded. Subsequently, the income summary account is closed to the retained earnings account, reflecting the net income or loss for the period. The retained earnings account is a measure of all earnings since the company's inception minus any dividends paid to shareholders. This account is crucial in maintaining the link between the income statement and the balance sheet, ensuring that the financial statements are consistent and accurate."

Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\nof inflation. Of course, it is important to remember that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed\nwith every option you decide on and every choice you make.\nKey Terms\nBureau of Labor Statistics\na group within the United States Department of Labor that is the primary fact-",

                    "answer": "The time value of money principle can be applied to financial decision-making when choosing between saving and investing by considering the potential growth of money through investments versus the opportunity cost of not using that money elsewhere. For instance, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an opportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. On the other hand, if you have high-interest debt, such as a 24% APR credit card, the cost of this debt might be higher than the potential earnings from an investment. Therefore, using the concept of TVM, you might determine that it is better to pay down the credit card debt rather than investing, as the interest savings would outweigh the potential gains from the investment. This principle helps individuals prioritize their financial decisions, balancing immediate needs against long-term goals and potential returns."
