With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen. \n \nLaw and Politics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n5 \nIn the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Philosophy of law is also \ncalled jurisprudence, and the two main schools are legal positivism and natural law. Although \nthere are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory.

The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald.

On the other hand, positive law theorists view law as simply the command of a sovereign, accepting that the legitimacy of the law is derived from the authority of the ruler or the state, rather than any inherent moral or ethical principles.

They observe that judges are part of a social context and their decisions are often influenced by their personal beliefs and the social environment they operate within. In contrast, the CLS school of thought emphasizes that the social order and law are dominated by the powerful, wealthy, and influential classes who use law to maintain their dominance and perpetuate an unjust distribution of rights and resources. CLS advocates seek to use law to challenge and dismantle these hierarchical structures of power, viewing law as inherently political and not neutral or value-free."

Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme \nCourt), a petition that is granted less than one out of every fifty times.

(1988 ed., Supp. III). \n \n \n \nI \n \nTeresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from \nApril 1985 until October 1987. Charles Hardy was Forklift’s president. \nThe Magistrate found that, throughout Harris’ time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of \nher gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendoes. Hardy told Harris on \nseveral occasions, in the presence of other employees, “You’re a woman, what do you know” and “We \nneed a man as the rental manager”; at least once, he told her she was “a dumbass woman.” Again in \nfront of others, he suggested that the two of them “go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris’s] \nraise.” Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants \npocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick \nthe objects up. He made sexual innuendoes about Harris’ and other women’s clothing. \n \nIn mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised \nthat Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would \nstop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job. But in early September, Hardy began \nanew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift’s customers, he asked her, again in \nfront of other employees, “What did you do, promise the guy…some [sex] Saturday night?” On \nOctober 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n34 \nHarris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy’s conduct had created an abusive work environment \nfor her because of her gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, \nadopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be “a close case,” but held \nthat Hardy’s conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy’s \ncomments “offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman,” but that they were not “so \nsevere as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris’s] psychological well-being. A reasonable woman \nmanager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not \nhave risen to the level of interfering with that person’s work performance. \n \n“Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.…Although \nHardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working \nenvironment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris].” \n \nIn focusing on the employee’s psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit \nprecedent. See Rabidue v. Osceola Refining Co., 805 F.2d 611, 620 (CA6 1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. \n1041, 95 L. Ed. 2d 823, 107 S. Ct. 1983 (1987). The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit affirmed in a brief unpublished decision…reported at 976 F.2d 733 (1992). \n \nWe granted certiorari, 507 U.S. 959 (1993), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on whether \nconduct, to be actionable as “abusive work environment” harassment (no quid pro quo harassment \nissue is present here), must “seriously affect [an employee’s] psychological well-being” or lead the \nplaintiff to “suffer injury.” Compare Rabidue (requiring serious effect on psychological well-being);",

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a \nperson or company is ethical. \n \nHere is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a \nclear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n45 \nright. All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale.

Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior.

                    "answer": "The goodwill of an organization is significantly influenced by the actions it takes and how those actions are perceived by various stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, investors, employees, and government officials. This perception plays a crucial role in the sale value of the business. Goodwill is typically considered an asset during the sale of a business and can command a higher price due to the positive reputation of the firm. Conversely, legal troubles or a reputation for legal issues can substantially decrease the business's sale value, affecting both the final accounting and the company’s stock price. Therefore, maintaining a good reputation is essential for maximizing the sale value of a business."

For instance, prohibitions against cheating Medicare or assisting suicide reflect collective moral judgments. Understanding these moral perspectives is vital for comprehending public policy debates. Issues like stem-cell research, medical marijuana, and abortion are contentious because they involve fundamental moral disagreements. Recognizing different ethical perspectives—such as rights, social utility, virtue, or social justice—helps clarify these debates and facilitates more informed discussions. This understanding is particularly useful for individuals and businesses engaging in or following these important societal discussions."

Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making. \n2. Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business. \n \n \nThere are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues. Some of them have been around for \ncenturies. It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held \nbeliefs about which perspective is best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems from a \nvariety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social \njustice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out some important perspectives, \nsuch as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy. \n \nUtilitarianism \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n50 \nUtilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the \nfree-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and \neconomics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each. The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the",

                    "answer": "After the shredding incident, Arthur Andersen faced severe consequences that ultimately led to the downfall of the company. Initially, a criminal case was brought against the firm based on the evidence of the shredding activities, which appeared to indicate an attempt to cover up information related to Enron's financial irregularities. This case resulted in a conviction for the company, although the Supreme Court later overturned the verdict. However, the damage had already been done. Before the conviction, many clients had already switched to other accounting firms that were not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court's reversal came too late to salvage the company's reputation. Even without the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share due to the public scrutiny and loss of trust among its clients."

                    "answer": "The text suggests that merely maximizing profits while staying within legal boundaries is insufficient for a business because it fails to address broader ethical considerations. The author argues that organizations need a higher standard of excellence to strive for, such as integrity and ethical behavior. The text posits that focusing solely on legal compliance can lead to short-term gains at the expense of long-term satisfaction of stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the community. Instead, the text advocates for acting ethically, which, while harder to measure quantitatively, can protect a company's reputation and goodwill. The author emphasizes that a company's reputation is shaped by how others perceive its actions, and ethical behavior is crucial for maintaining this positive perception over time."

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities? Only people can have \nresponsibilities. A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n67 \nresponsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this \nvague sense.… \n \nPresumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual \nproprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate \nexecutive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes. If these are “social responsibilities,” \nthey are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business. \n \nWhat does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity \nas businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation.

The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod. New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs. California’s \ndepartment of consumer affairs found that Sears had systematically overcharged by an average \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n74 \nof $223 for repairs and routinely billed for work that was not done. Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992. Sears also agreed to pay $3.5 million to cover the costs of various government \ninvestigations and to contribute $1.5 million annually to conduct auto mechanic training \nprograms. It also agreed to abandon its repair service quotas. The entire settlement cost Sears \n$30 million. Sears Auto Center sales also dropped about 15 to 20 percent after news of the \nscandal broke. \n \n \nNote that in boosting sales by performing unnecessary services, Sears suffered very bad publicity. Losses \nwere incalculable. The short-term gains were easy to measure; long-term consequences seldom are. The \ncase illustrates a number of important lessons: \n \n• \nPeople generally choose short-term gains over potential long-term losses. \n• \nPeople often justify the harm to others as being minimal or “necessary” to achieve the desired \nsales quota or financial goal. \n• \nIn working as a group, we often form an “us versus them” mentality. In the Sears case, it is likely \nthat Sears “insiders” looked at customers as “outsiders,” effectively treating them (in Kantian \nterms) as means rather than ends in themselves. In short, outsiders were used for the benefit of \ninsiders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n75 \n• \nThe long-term losses to Sears are difficult to quantify, while the short-term gains were easy to \nmeasure and (at least for a brief while) quite satisfying financially. \n• \nSears’ ongoing rip-offs were possible only because individual consumers lacked the relevant \ninformation about the service being offered. This lack of information is a market failure, since \nmany consumers were demanding more of Sears Auto Center services than they would have (and \nat a higher price) if relevant information had been available to them earlier. Sears, like other \nsellers of goods and services, took advantage of a market system, which, in its ideal form, would \nnot permit such information distortions. \n• \nPeople in the organization probably thought that the actions they took were necessary. \n \nNoting this last point, we can assume that these key people were motivated by maximizing profits and had \nlost sight of other goals for the organization. \n \nThe emphasis on doing whatever is necessary to win is entirely understandable, but it is not ethical. The \ntemptation will always exist—for individuals, companies, and nations—to dominate or to win and to write \nthe history of their actions in a way that justifies or overlooks the harm that has been done. In a way, this \nfits with the notion that “might makes right,” or that power is the ultimate measure of right and wrong. \n \nConscious Capitalism \nOne effort to integrate the two viewpoints of stakeholder theory and shareholder primacy is the conscious \ncapitalism movement. Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7]",

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed. The appellate court has quite a few choices: it can \naffirm, modify, reverse, or reverse and remand the lower court (return the case to the lower court for \nretrial). \n \nThe last type of appeal within the state courts system is to the highest court, the state supreme court, \nwhich is composed of a single panel of between five and nine judges and is usually located in the state \ncapital. (The intermediate appellate courts are usually composed of panels of three judges and are situated \nin various locations around the state.) In a few states, the highest court goes by a different name: in New \nYork, it is known as the court of appeals. In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels.

                    "answer": "An appellate court does not retry the evidence presented in the trial court; instead, it reviews the procedural correctness of the trial and the application of the appropriate law. The appellate court examines if the judge provided proper instructions to the jury, admitted or excluded evidence appropriately, and correctly interpreted the relevant laws. If the appellate court finds no legal errors, it will affirm the lower court's decision. Otherwise, it can modify, reverse, or remand the case back to the lower court for retrial."

General jurisdiction courts, on the other hand, deal with more serious civil and criminal cases, including family matters, commercial disputes, and serious crimes. Additionally, some states have specialized courts for specific types of cases, such as landlord-tenant disputes or probate. The highest court in each state is the supreme court, while in some states, it is called the court of appeals. Furthermore, the federal court system consists of three levels: district courts, circuit courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court, ensuring uniformity across the country."

There is no federal question presented here (the claim is \nbased on state common law), and the United States is not a party, so the only basis for federal court \njurisdiction would be diversity jurisdiction.

The \nfederal judge would decide the case using federal civil procedure but would have to make the appropriate \nchoice of state law.

Unless the defendant had some significant contact with the plaintiff’s state, the plaintiff may \nindeed have to. For instance, suppose a traveler from Maine stopped at a roadside diner in Montana and \nordered a slice of homemade pie that was tainted and caused him to be sick. The traveler may not simply \nreturn home and mail the diner a notice that he is suing it in a Maine court. But if out-of-state defendants \nhave some contact with the plaintiff’s state of residence, there might be grounds to bring them within the \njurisdiction of the plaintiff’s state courts. In Burger King v. Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 \"Cases\", the federal \ncourt in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee. \n \nAgain, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction \nover each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made. Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness—and the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from \ntheir home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and \nthe state where a lawsuit is brought. \n \nSummary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction \n1. \nOnce a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant \nover which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction. \n2. If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3. Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction \nover a particular defendant (see rule 4). \n1. \nIn order to get a judgment in a civil action, the plaintiff must serve a copy of the \ncomplaint and a summons on the defendant. \n2. There are many ways to do this. \n• \nThe process server personally serves a complaint on the defendant. \n• \nThe process server leaves a copy of the summons and complaint at the residence \nof the defendant, in the hands of a competent person. \n• \nThe process server sends the summons and complaint by certified mail, return \nreceipt requested. \n• \nThe process server, if all other means are not possible, notifies the defendant by \npublication in a newspaper having a minimum number of readers (as may be \nspecified by law). \n4. In addition to successfully serving the defendant with process, a plaintiff must convince the court \nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process and any \nstatutes in that state that prescribe the jurisdictional reach of that state (the so-called long-arm \nstatutes). The Supreme Court has long recognized various bases for judging whether such process \nis fair. \n1. \nConsent. The defendant agrees to the court’s jurisdiction by coming to court, answering \nthe complaint, and having the matter litigated there. \n2. Domicile. The defendant is a permanent resident of that state. \n3. Event. The defendant did something in that state, related to the lawsuit, that makes it fair \nfor the state to say, “Come back and defend!” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n104 \n4. Service of process within the state will effectively provide personal jurisdiction over the \nnonresident. \n \nAgain, let’s consider Mrs. Robinson and her children in the Audi accident.

But \nwhile the Arizona court would have subject matter jurisdiction over any products-liability claim (or any \nclaim that was not required to be heard in a federal court), the Arizona court would face an issue of “in \npersonam jurisdiction,” or personal jurisdiction: under the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, each state must extend due process to citizens of all of the other states. Because fairness is \nessential to due process, the court must consider whether it is fair to require an out-of-state defendant to \nappear and defend against a lawsuit that could result in a judgment against that defendant. \nAlmost every state in the United States has a statute regarding personal jurisdiction, instructing judges \nwhen it is permissible to assert personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state resident. These are called long-\narm statutes. But no state can reach out beyond the limits of what is constitutionally permissible under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the states with its proviso to guarantee the due process rights of \nthe citizens of every state in the union. The “minimum contacts” test in Burger King v. \nRudzewicz (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") tries to make the fairness mandate of the due process clause more \nspecific. So do other tests articulated in the case (such as “does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice”). These tests are posed by the Supreme Court and heeded by all lower courts in \norder to honor the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process guarantees. These tests are in \naddition to any state long-arm statute’s instructions to courts regarding the assertion of personal \njurisdiction over nonresidents. \n \nChoice of Law and Choice of Forum Clauses \nIn a series of cases, the Supreme Court has made clear that it will honor contractual choices of parties in a \nlawsuit. Suppose the parties to a contract wind up in court arguing over the application of the contract’s \nterms. If the parties are from two different states, the judge may have difficulty determining which law to \napply (see Table 3.1 \"Sample Conflict-of-Law Principles\"). But if the contract says that a particular state’s \nlaw will be applied if there is a dispute, then ordinarily the judge will apply that state’s law as a rule of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n105 \ndecision in the case. For example, Kumar Patel (a Missouri resident) opens a brokerage account with \nGoldman, Sachs and Co., and the contractual agreement calls for “any disputes arising under this \nagreement” to be determined “according to the laws of the state of New York.” When Kumar claims in a \nMissouri court that his broker is “churning” his account, and, on the other hand, Goldman, Sachs claims \nthat Kumar has failed to meet his margin call and owes $38,568.25 (plus interest and attorney’s fees), the \njudge in Missouri will apply New York law based on the contract between Kumar and Goldman, Sachs. \n \nOrdinarily, a choice-of-law clause will be accompanied by a choice-of-forum clause. In a choice-of-forum \nclause, the parties in the contract specify which court they will go to in the event of a dispute arising under \nthe terms of contract. For example, Harold (a resident of Virginia) rents a car from Alamo at the Denver \nInternational Airport. He does not look at the fine print on the contract. He also waives all collision and \nother insurance that Alamo offers at the time of his rental. While driving back from Telluride Bluegrass \nFestival, he has an accident in Idaho Springs, Colorado. His rented Nissan Altima is badly damaged. On \nreturning to Virginia, he would like to settle up with Alamo, but his insurance company and Alamo cannot \ncome to terms. He realizes, however, that he has agreed to hear the dispute with Alamo in a specific court \nin San Antonio, Texas. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, any court in the United States is likely to \nuphold the choice-of-form clause and require Harold (or his insurance company) to litigate in San \nAntonio, Texas. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are two court systems in the United States.

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings.

                    "answer": "The principle that prevents a state court from hearing a Title VII claim without federal court's exclusive jurisdiction being established, despite the plaintiff and defendant both being from the same state, is the doctrine of diversity jurisdiction. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress did not specify that federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over these claims. However, if the plaintiff and defendant are from different states and meet certain financial criteria, a federal court could exercise diversity jurisdiction. If Mrs. Harris, a resident of Tennessee, wishes to sue Forklift Systems, Inc., which is also incorporated in Tennessee, she would need to show that the case meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction, such as having a substantial amount in controversy. Otherwise, she could file her complaint in a state court, provided she has exhausted the administrative remedies as required by Title VII."

For example, one party simply makes a written \ndemand, stating the time at which the deposition will take place or the type of documents it wishes to \ninspect and make copies of. A party unreasonably resisting discovery methods (whether depositions, \nwritten interrogatories, or requests for documents) can be challenged, however, and judges are often \nbrought into the process to push reluctant parties to make more disclosure or to protect a party from \nirrelevant or unreasonable discovery requests. For example, the party receiving the discovery request can \napply to the court for a protective order if it can show that the demand is for privileged material (e.g., a \nparty’s lawyers’ records are not open for inspection) or that the demand was made to harass the opponent. \nIn complex cases between companies, the discovery of documents can run into tens of millions of pages \nand can take years.

If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

[Citations] Thus where the defendant “deliberately” has engaged in significant activities \nwithin a State, or has created “continuing obligations” between himself and residents of the forum, he \nmanifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are \nshielded by “the benefits and protections” of the forum’s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to \nrequire him to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum as well. \n \nJurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physically \nenter the forum State. Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320.

The trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made and draw from that evidence all reasonable inferences in their favor.

If after reviewing the evidence, the court is of the opinion that reasonable minds could not come to the result reached by the jury, then the motion for JNOV should be granted. In a 'failure to warn' product liability action, a plaintiff must prove four elements of negligence: (1) that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, (2) that the defendant violated that duty, (3) that the defendant's breach of that duty was a proximate cause of the damages suffered by the plaintiff, and (4) that the plaintiff suffered damages. Additionally, to establish a prima facie case that a manufacturer's breach of its duty to warn was a proximate cause of an injury sustained, a plaintiff must present evidence that the product would have been used differently had the proffered warnings been given. The text also highlights that a manufacturer has a duty to warn the purchasers or users of its product about dangers associated with intended use, but not of a danger arising from an unforeseeable misuse of its product.

                    "answer": "The court found that the plaintiffs' failure to warn claim was fatally flawed due to the lack of evidence showing that a flammability warning on JJP's cotton batting would have dissuaded the plaintiffs from using the product in the manner they did. Specifically, the plaintiffs repeatedly claimed in their response brief that Susan Ferlito testified she would never use cotton batting again. However, the trial transcript revealed that she never made such a statement. Furthermore, the transcript contained no statement by Susan Ferlito or her husband, Frank J. Ferlito, indicating that a flammability warning on the product's package would have changed their behavior. During oral argument, plaintiffs' counsel conceded that there was no testimony during the trial suggesting that the plaintiffs would have acted differently if there had been a flammability warning. This absence of evidence directly impacts the proximate cause element of the negligence claim, which is crucial for establishing a failure to warn claim. Consequently, the plaintiffs' failure to provide evidence supporting that a warning would have altered their conduct led to the rejection of their case."

Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution. \n2. Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers. \n3. Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant. \n \n \nThe Constitution as Reflecting American Values \nIn the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving \nallegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution \n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this \noath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n141 \ntime—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; \nthe fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes \nclear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the \nidea of rights is particularly strong. \n \nThe Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various \nrights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is",

Under this system, certain powers are reserved exclusively to the states, while others are granted to the federal government. The Tenth Amendment explicitly states that powers not delegated to the federal government nor prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or the people. The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in interpreting the extent of these powers and resolving disputes over federalism. When state and federal laws conflict, the Supreme Court, under the Supremacy Clause, determines which law takes precedence. This role allows the Court to ensure that both levels of government operate within their constitutional boundaries and to maintain a coherent legal framework for business and commerce."

Describe both the wider use of the commerce clause from World War II through the 1990s and the \nlimitations the Supreme Court imposed in Lopez and other cases. \n \n \nFirst, turn to Article I, Section 8. The commerce clause gives Congress the exclusive power to make \nlaws relating to foreign trade and commerce and to commerce among the various states. Most of the \nfederally created legal environment springs from this one clause: if Congress is not authorized in the \nConstitution to make certain laws, then it acts unconstitutionally and its actions may be ruled \nunconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Lately, the Supreme Court has not been shy about ruling acts of \nCongress unconstitutional. \n \nHere are the first five parts of Article I, Section 8, which sets forth the powers of the federal legislature. \nThe commerce clause is in boldface. It is short, but most federal legislation affecting business depends on \nthis very clause: \n \nSection 8 \n[Clause 1] The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, \nto pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; \nbut all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; \n[Clause 2] To borrow Money on the credit of the United States; \n \n[Clause 3] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes; \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n147 \n[Clause 4] To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of \nBankruptcies throughout the United States; \n \n[Clause 5] To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of \nWeights and Measures; \n \nEarly Commerce Clause Cases \nFor many years, the Supreme Court was very strict in applying the commerce clause: Congress could only \nuse it to legislate aspects of the movement of goods from one state to another. Anything else was deemed \nlocal rather than national. For example, In Hammer v. Dagenhart, decided in 1918, a 1916 federal statute \nhad barred transportation in interstate commerce of goods produced in mines or factories employing \nchildren under fourteen or employing children fourteen and above for more than eight hours a day. A \ncomplaint was filed in the US District Court for the Western District of North Carolina by a father in his \nown behalf and on behalf of his two minor sons, one under the age of fourteen years and the other \nbetween fourteen and sixteen years, who were employees in a cotton mill in Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThe father’s lawsuit asked the court to enjoin (block) the enforcement of the act of Congress intended to \nprevent interstate commerce in the products of child labor. \n \nThe Supreme Court saw the issue as whether Congress had the power under the commerce clause to \ncontrol interstate shipment of goods made by children under the age of fourteen. The court found that \nCongress did not. The court cited several cases that had considered what interstate commerce could be \nconstitutionally regulated by Congress. In Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of",

This decision is significant because it upheld slavery and denied African Americans their basic rights, which is now widely recognized as unjust. Roe v. Wade, on the other hand, is a landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide. While it remains a highly debated topic, some argue that societal views and legal standards have evolved since the 1970s, making these decisions less relevant today. The text suggests that the court does not need to wait one hundred years to overturn its prior case precedents, indicating that such decisions can be re-evaluated based on changing societal norms and values."

Under the Supreme Court’s rulings, anything \nthat moves in channels of interstate commerce is “commerce,” even if someone is paying to get rid of \nsomething instead of buying something. \n \nThus the states are bound by Supreme Court decisions under the dormant commerce clause to do nothing \nthat differentiates between articles of commerce that originate from within the state from those that \noriginate elsewhere. If Michigan were to let counties decide for themselves whether to take garbage from \noutside of the county or not, this could also be a discrimination based on a place of origin outside the \nstate. (Suppose, for instance, each county were to decide not to take waste from outside the county; then \nall Michigan counties would effectively be excluding waste from outside of Michigan, which is \ndiscriminatory.) [3] \n \nThe Supreme Court probably would uphold any solid waste requirements that did not differentiate on the \nbasis of origin. If, for example, all waste had to be inspected for specific hazards, then the law would apply \nequally to in-state and out-of-state garbage. Because this is the dormant commerce clause, Congress could \nstill act (i.e., it could use its broad commerce clause powers) to say that states are free to keep out-of-state \nwaste from coming into their own borders. But Congress has declined to do so. What follows is a \nstatement from one of the US senators from Michigan, Carl Levin, in 2003, regarding the significant \namounts of waste that were coming into Michigan from Toronto, Canada. \n \nDealing with Unwelcome Waste \nSenator Carl Levin, January 2003 \nMichigan is facing an intolerable situation with regard to the importation of waste from other \nstates and Canada. \n \nCanada is the largest source of waste imports to Michigan. Approximately 65 truckloads of waste \ncome in to Michigan per day from Toronto alone, and an estimated 110–130 trucks come in from \nCanada each day. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n156 \nThis problem isn’t going to get any better. Ontario’s waste shipments are growing as the Toronto \narea signs new contracts for waste disposal here and closes its two remaining landfills. At the \nbeginning of 1999, the Toronto area was generating about 2.8 million tons of waste annually, \nabout 700,000 tons of which were shipped to Michigan. By early this year, barring unforeseen \ndevelopments, the entire 2.8 million tons will be shipped to Michigan for disposal. \nWhy can’t Canada dispose of its trash in Canada? They say that after 20 years of searching they \nhave not been able to find a suitable Ontario site for Toronto’s garbage. Ontario has about \n345,000 square miles compared to Michigan’s 57,000 square miles. With six times the land mass, \nthat argument is laughable. \n \nThe Michigan Department of Environmental Quality estimates that, for every five years of \ndisposal of Canadian waste at the current usage volume, Michigan is losing a full year of landfill \ncapacity. The environmental impacts on landfills, including groundwater contamination, noise \npollution and foul odors, are exacerbated by the significant increase in the use of our landfills \nfrom sources outside of Michigan. \n \nI have teamed up with Senator Stabenow and Congressman Dingell to introduce legislation that \nwould strengthen our ability to stop shipments of waste from Canada. \n \nWe have protections contained in a 17 year-old international agreement between the U.S. and \nCanada called the Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste. \nThe U.S. and Canada entered into this agreement in 1986 to allow the shipment of hazardous \nwaste across the U.S./Canadian border for treatment, storage or disposal. In 1992, the two \ncountries decided to add municipal solid waste to the agreement. To protect both countries, the \nagreement requires notification of shipments to the importing country and it also provides that \nthe importing country may withdraw consent for shipments. Both reasons are evidence that these \nshipments were intended to be limited. However, the agreement’s provisions have not been \nenforced by the United States. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n157 \nCanada could not export waste to Michigan without the 1986 agreement, but the U.S. has not \nimplemented the provisions that are designed to protect the people of Michigan.

                    "answer": "The dormant commerce clause affects state laws concerning solid waste disposal by prohibiting states from enacting laws that discriminate against interstate commerce. For instance, if a state law allows counties to decide individually whether to accept garbage from outside the county, it could be seen as discriminatory based on the place of origin. However, the Supreme Court would likely uphold any solid waste requirements that do not differentiate on the basis of origin. An example would be a law requiring all waste to be inspected for specific hazards, which would apply equally to in-state and out-of-state garbage."

Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express \npreemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s. The case was a wrongful death action \nbrought against tobacco companies on behalf of Rose Cipollone, a lung cancer victim who had started \nsmoking cigarette in the 1940s. The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that \nstated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to \nthe advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions \nwere preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of \nthe supremacy clause. Preemption can be express or implied. In cases where preemption is implied, the court \nusually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory \nscheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

At the same time, concern over oil \nspills in Puget Sound led the state of Washington to impose fairly strict standards on oil tankers and \nrequirements for the training of oil tanker pilots. In addition, Washington’s state law imposed many other \nrequirements that went above and beyond agreed-upon requirements in the international agreements \nnegotiated by the federal government.

The legislation does preserve the right of \nconsumers to litigate in the event of a dispute arising with the product or service provider; that is, with this \nlegislation, consumers will not unknowingly waive their right to a trial at common law.

Even if the \nstate’s long-arm statute would seem to allow such a judgment, other states should not give it full faith and \ncredit (see Article V of the Constitution).

            "chunk": "in an Alabama court not too long ago. [5] \nThe plaintiff, Dr. Ira Gore, bought a new BMW for $40,000 from a dealer in Alabama. He later discovered \nthat the vehicle’s exterior had been slightly damaged in transit from Europe and had therefore been \nrepainted by the North American distributor prior to his purchase. The vehicle was, by best estimates, \nworth about 10 percent less than he paid for it. The distributor, BMW of North America, had routinely \nsold slightly damaged cars as brand new if the damage could be fixed for less than 3 percent of the cost of \nthe car. In the trial, Dr. Gore sought $4,000 in compensatory damages and also punitive damages. The \nAlabama trial jury considered that BMW was engaging in a fraudulent practice and wanted to punish the \ndefendant for a number of frauds it estimated at somewhere around a thousand nationwide. The jury \nawarded not only the $4,000 in compensatory damages but also $4 million in punitive damages, which \nwas later reduced to $2 million by the Alabama Supreme Court. On appeal to the US Supreme Court, the \ncourt found that punitive damages may not be “grossly excessive.” If they are, then they violate \nsubstantive due process. Whatever damages a state awards must be limited to what is reasonably \nnecessary to vindicate the state’s legitimate interest in punishment and deterrence. \n \n“Equal protection of the laws” is a phrase that originates in the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868. \nThe amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal \nprotection of the laws.” This is the equal protection clause. It means that, generally speaking, \ngovernments must treat people equally. Unfair classifications among people or corporations will not be \npermitted. A well-known example of unfair classification would be race discrimination: requiring white \nchildren and black children to attend different public schools or requiring “separate but equal” public \nservices, such as water fountains or restrooms. Yet despite the clear intent of the 1868 amendment, \n“separate but equal” was the law of the land until Brown v. Board of Education (1954). [6] \n \nGovernments make classifications every day, so not all classifications can be illegal under the equal \nprotection clause. People with more income generally pay a greater percentage of their income in taxes. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n171 \nPeople with proper medical training are licensed to become doctors; people without that training cannot \nbe licensed and commit a criminal offense if they do practice medicine. To know what classifications are \npermissible under the Fourteenth Amendment, we need to know what is being classified. The court has \ncreated three classifications, and the outcome of any equal protection case can usually be predicted by \nknowing how the court is likely to classify the case: \n \n• \nMinimal scrutiny: economic and social relations. Government actions are usually upheld if there \nis a rational basis for them. \n• \nIntermediate scrutiny: gender. Government classifications are sometimes upheld. \n• \nStrict scrutiny: race, ethnicity, and fundamental rights. Classifications based on any of these are \nalmost never upheld. \n \nUnder minimal scrutiny for economic and social regulation, laws that regulate economic or social issues \nare presumed valid and will be upheld if they are rationally related to legitimate goals of government. So, \nfor example, if the city of New Orleans limits the number of street vendors to some rational number (more \nthan one but fewer than the total number that could possibly fit on the sidewalks), the local ordinance \nwould not be overturned as a violation of equal protection. \n \nUnder intermediate scrutiny, the city of New Orleans might limit the number of street vendors who are \nmen. For example, suppose that the city council decreed that all street vendors must be women, thinking \nthat would attract even more tourism. A classification like this, based on sex, will have to meet a sterner \ntest than a classification resulting from economic or social regulation. A law like this would have to \nsubstantially relate to important government objectives. Increasingly, courts have nullified government \nsex classifications as societal concern with gender equality has grown. (See Shannon Faulkner’s case \nagainst The Citadel, an all-male state school.) [7] \n \nSuppose, however, that the city of New Orleans decided that no one of Middle Eastern heritage could \ndrive a taxicab or be a street vendor. That kind of classification would be examined with strict scrutiny to \nsee if there was any compelling justification for it. As noted, classifications such as this one are almost \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n172 \nnever upheld.

The [Connecticut] law, however, operates \ndirectly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation. \n \n[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by \nemanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create \nzones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The \nThird Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace \nwithout the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.  \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n175 \nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-\nIncrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force \nhim to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the \nConstitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” \n \nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of \nthe sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the \nFourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and \nparticularly reserved to the people.” \n \n[The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their \nmanufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] \nrelationship. Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of \nmarital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of \nprivacy surrounding the marital relationship. \n \nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than \nour school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate \nto the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in \nliving, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for \nas noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. \n \nMr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting. \n \nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I \nthink this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in \nthe oblique context of the present case.

Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment \nmeant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n177 \npassed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James \nMadison no little wonder. \n \nWhat provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of \nprivacy “created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.” With all deference, I can find no such \ngeneral right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever \nbefore decided by this Court. \n \nAt the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not “conform to current \ncommunity standards.” But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community \nstandards. We are here to decide cases “agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.” It is \nthe essence of judicial duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is \nwise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the \npeople of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth \nAmendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to \ntake this law off the books. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Which opinion is the strict constructionist opinion here—Justice Douglas’s or that of Justices Stewart and \nBlack? \n2. What would have happened if the Supreme Court had allowed the Connecticut Supreme Court decision to \nstand and followed Justice Black’s reasoning? Is it likely that the citizens of Connecticut would have \npersuaded their elected representatives to repeal the law challenged here? \n \n \nWickard v. Filburn \nWickard v.

The dissenting opinion specifically criticizes the majority for finding a 'right of privacy' in the Constitution without any explicit textual basis, asserting that such a general right cannot be found in the Bill of Rights or any other part of the Constitution. Furthermore, the dissenting opinion suggests that the majority's interpretation turns somersaults with history, as the Ninth Amendment was intended to affirm that powers not delegated to the federal government remain with the states and the people. The dissenting opinion believes that if the law in question does not align with community standards, the people of Connecticut can exercise their rights under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it, rather than having the Supreme Court invalidate the law through judicial activism."

Consolidated Freightways Corp. \n450 U.S. 662 (U.S. Supreme Court 1981) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n179 \n \nJUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE \nWHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS joined. \n \nThe question is whether an Iowa statute that prohibits the use of certain large trucks within the State \nunconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \n \nI \nAppellee Consolidated Freightways Corporation of Delaware (Consolidated) is one of the largest common \ncarriers in the country: it offers service in 48 States under a certificate of public convenience and necessity \nissued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180 \nBecause of Iowa’s statutory scheme, Consolidated cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move commodities \nthrough the State. Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power.

This excess wheat harvest of 239 bushels was subject to a penalty under the terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, because it was considered farm marketing excess, which was against the Act's objective to control the volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce to prevent surpluses and shortages."

On the question of safety, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” 475 F.Supp. 544, 549 (SD Iowa 1979). For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests. \nThe total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and \nproblematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from \ninterferences that seriously impede it.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n181 \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 612 F.2d 1064 (1979). It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980). We now affirm. \n \n \n \nII \nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication. The \nClause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the \nstate[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949). The Clause permits \nCongress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent \nactions of the States. It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power \neven without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333 at 350 (1977). The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure.

Similarly, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' decision, emphasizing that the safety benefits of the law were minimal and did not outweigh the national interest in maintaining free interstate commerce.

            "chunk": "the 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections. The concern over backing \ncapability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate. In any event, no \nevidence suggested any difference in backing capability between the 60-foot doubles that Iowa permits \nand the 65-foot doubles that it bans. Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles. Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the \nrequest of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been \nshown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer \ncombinations or conventional tractor-semitrailers.” \n \nIn sum, although Iowa introduced more evidence on the question of safety than did Wisconsin \nin Raymond, the record as a whole was not more favorable to the State. \n \nB \nConsolidated, meanwhile, demonstrated that Iowa’s law substantially burdens interstate commerce. \nTrucking companies that wish to continue to use 65-foot doubles must route them around Iowa or detach \nthe trailers of the doubles and ship them through separately. Alternatively, trucking companies must use \nthe smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law. Each of these options engenders \ninefficiency and added expense. The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV. Omitted] \nV \nIn sum, the statutory exemptions, their history, and the arguments Iowa has advanced in support of its \nlaw in this litigation all suggest that the deference traditionally accorded a State’s safety judgment is not \nwarranted. See Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 444-447. The controlling factors thus are the findings of \nthe District Court, accepted by the Court of Appeals, with respect to the relative safety of the types of \ntrucks at issue, and the substantiality of the burden on interstate commerce. \n \nBecause Iowa has imposed this burden without any significant countervailing safety interest, its statute \nviolates the Commerce Clause.

                    "answer": "The case demonstrates that Iowa's regulation of truck size significantly impacts interstate commerce and transportation efficiency. Companies that wish to use 65-foot doubles must either reroute their trucks around Iowa or detach the trailers and ship them separately, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. For instance, Consolidated Truck Lines faced an additional $2 million annually due to these regulations. Moreover, the requirement to use smaller trucks like 55-foot singles or longer distances for 65-foot doubles increases the total distance driven to transport the same amount of goods, thereby potentially increasing the number of accidents. This outcome shifts the burden of safety and economic costs from Iowa to other states, as the increased mileage drives up the likelihood of accidents. Overall, the case underscores how such state-level regulations can disrupt efficient interstate transportation and increase costs for businesses and consumers alike."

                    "answer": "The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA) restricted corporations and unions from using their general treasury funds to make direct contributions to candidates or independent expenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, through any form of media, in connection with certain qualified federal elections. Specifically, BCRA §203 amended §441b to prohibit 'electioneering communications,' which are defined as any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. Furthermore, the regulation states that an electioneering communication is publicly distributed if it can be received by 50,000 or more persons in a state where a primary election is being held within 30 days. To circumvent these restrictions, corporations and unions can establish a 'separate segregated fund' (known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes, with the funds limited to donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions, members of the union."

Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970). See Note 5.4 \"Ideal Conditions for a Free Market\" in the \nsidebar. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n210 \nBy contrast, members of executive branch agencies serve at the pleasure of the president and are therefore \nfar more amenable to political control. One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president.

Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate.

Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

The APA also addressed the conduct of hearings, prohibiting ex parte communications between the administrative law judge and outsiders or one party when both parties are not present.

But the Supreme Court ruled that the areas photographed were “open fields” and \nnot subject to the protections of the Fourth Amendment. [4] \n \nAccess to Business Information in Government Files \nIn 1966, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), opening up to the citizenry many of \nthe files of the government. (The act was amended in 1974 and again in 1976 to overcome a tendency of \nmany agencies to stall or refuse access to their files.) Under the FOIA, any person has a legally enforceable \nright of access to all government documents, with nine specific exceptions, such as classified military \nintelligence, medical files, and trade secrets and commercial or financial information if “obtained from a \nperson and privileged or confidential.” Without the trade-secret and financial-information exemptions, \nbusiness competitors could, merely by requesting it, obtain highly sensitive competitive information \nsitting in government files. \n \nA federal agency is required under the FOIA to respond to a document request within ten days.

Moreover, not all documents are \navailable for public inspection.

For these \ncompanies, submitting such information presents a danger under the FOIA of disclosure to competitors. \nTo protect information from disclosure, the company is well advised to mark each document as privileged \nand confidential so that government officials reviewing it for a FOIA request will not automatically \ndisclose it.

Explain under what circumstances it is possible to sue the government. \n \n \nNeither an administrative agency’s adjudication nor its issuance of a regulation is necessarily final. Most \nfederal agency decisions are appealable to the federal circuit courts. To get to court, the appellant must \novercome numerous complex hurdles. He or she must have standing—that is, be in some sense directly \naffected by the decision or regulation. The case must be ripe for review; administrative remedies such as \nfurther appeal within the agency must have been exhausted. \n \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n224 \nBefore you can complain to court about an agency’s action, you must first try to get the agency to \nreconsider its action. Generally, you must have asked for a hearing at the hearing examiner level, there \nmust have been a decision reached that was unfavorable to you, and you must have appealed the decision \nto the full board. The full board must rule against you, and only then will you be heard by a court. The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose. See Section 5.6 \n\"Cases\", American Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan. \n \nIn summary, then, an individual or a company may (after exhaustion of administrative remedies) \nchallenge agency action where such action is the following: \n \n• \nnot in accordance with the agency’s scope of authority \n• \nnot in accordance with the US Constitution or the Administrative Procedure Act \n• \nnot in accordance with the substantial evidence test \n• \nunwarranted by the facts \n•",

The rationale behind allowing warrantless searches in these industries is to swiftly address potential safety hazards and prevent the distribution of harmful products.

                    "answer": "FOIA requests can often take months or years to be fulfilled due to the volume of requests received by government agencies and the time-consuming process of reviewing and redacting sensitive information. Agencies must carefully examine each request to determine which documents can be released, which need to be redacted, and which are exempt from disclosure. Additionally, the complexity of the documents and the need for interagency coordination can significantly delay the response time. Furthermore, the sheer number of requests can overwhelm agency resources, leading to backlogs and extended processing times."

This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job. A few years \nlater, Congress changed the law, making him ineligible if he earned more than 80 percent in anyone year. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n227 \nFor many years, Charles earned considerably less than the ceiling amount. But then one year he got the \nopportunity to make some extra money. Not wishing to lose his pension, he called an employee relations \nspecialist in the US Navy and asked how much he could earn and still keep his pension. The specialist \ngave him erroneous information over the telephone and then sent him an out-of-date form that said \nCharles could safely take on the extra work. Unfortunately, as it turned out, Charles did exceed the salary \nlimit, and so the government cut off his pension during the time he earned too much. Charles sues to \nrecover his lost pension. He argues that he relied to his detriment on false information supplied by the \nnavy and that in fairness the government should be estopped from denying his claim. \n \nUnfortunately for Charles, he will lose his case. In Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, the \nSupreme Court reasoned that it would be unconstitutional to permit recovery. [4] The appropriations \nclause of Article I says that federal money can be paid out only through an appropriation made by law. \nThe law prevented this particular payment to be made. If the court were to make an exception, it would \npermit executive officials in effect to make binding payments, even though unauthorized, simply by \nmisrepresenting the facts. The harsh reality, therefore, is that mistakes of the government are generally \nheld against the individual, not the government, unless the law specifically provides for recompense (as, \nfor example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act just discussed). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAfter exhausting administrative remedies, there are numerous grounds for seeking judicial review of an \nagency’s order or of a final rule. While courts defer to agencies to some degree, an agency must follow its own \nrules, comply with the Administrative Procedure Act, act within the scope of its delegated authority, avoid \nacting in an arbitrary manner, and make final rules that are supported by substantial evidence. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve? \n2. Why is ignorance of the law no excuse? Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be \ncomplicated and sometimes ambiguous? \n \n \n \n \n6.2 Types of Crimes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

                    "answer": "Under the law, murder stands out as the most severely punished form of homicide due to the presence of 'malice aforethought', which signifies the intent to kill. Unlike justifiable or excusable homicides, where killings occur in circumstances sanctioned by law or due to accidents without fault, murder involves a deliberate intent to take a life. This intent can be immediate or arise swiftly in situations like a heated altercation, but it must be present. Additionally, a killing during the commission of a felony, regardless of the perpetrator's intent, can also be classified as murder under the felony murder rule. These distinctions highlight the gravity of the act of taking a life intentionally and underscore the legal penalties associated with such actions."

                    "answer": "The felony murder rule significantly impacts accomplices in a crime by holding them responsible for the unintended death that occurs during the commission of a felony, even if they did not directly cause the death or have the intent to kill. This rule extends liability beyond the principal offender to those involved in the crime. For instance, consider a scenario where a group of robbers plan a heist, and during the robbery, a gun accidentally discharges, resulting in the death of an innocent bystander. Under the felony murder rule, the driver of the getaway car, who was stationed a block away and had no direct involvement in the shooting, could still be convicted of murder. This demonstrates the broad scope of the felony murder rule and the potential for accomplices to face severe consequences for unintended deaths that occur during criminal activities."

Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law.

Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison). States are divided on this, but thirty-seven states have ruled out factual impossibility as a defense \nto the crime of attempt. \n \nLegal impossibility is different, and is usually acknowledged as a valid defense. If the defendant completes \nall of his intended acts, but those acts do not fulfill all the required elements of a crime, there could be a \nsuccessful “impossibility” defense.

                    "question": "How does the legal concept of 'attempt' apply in criminal law, and what factors influence whether an individual's actions constitute an attempt to commit a crime?",
                    "answer": "In criminal law, the concept of 'attempt' refers to the act of making a substantial step towards committing a crime with the intent to do so. Unlike the completion of the crime itself, attempting to commit a crime can lead to legal consequences. However, for an attempt to be considered, the individual must have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the crime, indicating a clear intent to commit it. The determination of whether an individual's actions constitute an attempt is often complex and left to the discretion of the jury. Factors influencing this decision include the proximity to the completion of the crime, the nature of the steps taken, and the level of intent demonstrated. Courts typically require evidence showing that the individual was close to completing the crime and that their actions were a significant step towards its fulfillment. For instance, in the case where Brett points a gun at Ashley, intending to shoot her, and misses by four feet, he may be considered guilty of an attempt to murder. Conversely, if he was merely preparing to shoot and was interrupted before taking a substantial step, he might not be found guilty of an attempt."

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nWe granted certiorari to consider whether the jury instructions in the prosecution of a corporate officer \nunder § 301 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1042, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 331 \n(k), were appropriate under United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 (1943). Acme Markets, Inc., is a \nnational retail food chain with approximately 36,000 employees, 874 retail outlets, 12 general \nwarehouses, and four special warehouses. Its headquarters, including the office of the president, \nrespondent Park, who is chief executive officer of the corporation, are located in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania. In a five-count information filed in the United States District Court for the District of \nMaryland, the Government charged Acme and respondent with violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. Each count of the information alleged that the defendants had received food that had been \nshipped in interstate commerce and that, while the food was being held for sale in Acme’s Baltimore \nwarehouse following shipment in interstate commerce, they caused it to be held in a building accessible to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n272 \nrodents and to be exposed to contamination by rodents. These acts were alleged to have resulted in the \nfood’s being adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. §§ 342 (a)(3) and (4), in violation of 21 U.S.C. § \n331 (k). \n \nAcme pleaded guilty to each count of the information. Respondent pleaded not guilty. The evidence at \ntrial demonstrated that in April 1970 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised respondent by \nletter of insanitary conditions in Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. In 1971 the FDA found that similar \nconditions existed in the firm’s Baltimore warehouse. An FDA consumer safety officer testified concerning \nevidence of rodent infestation and other insanitary conditions discovered during a 12-day inspection of \nthe Baltimore warehouse in November and December 1971. He also related that a second inspection of the \nwarehouse had been conducted in March 1972. On that occasion the inspectors found that there had been \nimprovement in the sanitary conditions, but that “there was still evidence of rodent activity in the building \nand in the warehouses and we found some rodent-contaminated lots of food items.” \n \nThe Government also presented testimony by the Chief of Compliance of the FDA’s Baltimore office, who \ninformed respondent by letter of the conditions at the Baltimore warehouse after the first inspection. \nThere was testimony by Acme’s Baltimore division vice president, who had responded to the letter on \nbehalf of Acme and respondent and who described the steps taken to remedy the insanitary conditions \ndiscovered by both inspections. The Government’s final witness, Acme’s vice president for legal affairs \nand assistant secretary, identified respondent as the president and chief executive officer of the company \nand read a bylaw prescribing the duties of the chief executive officer. He testified that respondent \nfunctioned by delegating “normal operating duties” including sanitation, but that he retained “certain \nthings, which are the big, broad, principles of the operation of the company and had “the responsibility of \nseeing that they all work together.” \n \nAt the close of the Government’s case in chief, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \nground that “the evidence in chief has shown that Mr. Park is not personally concerned in this Food and \nDrug violation.” The trial judge denied the motion, stating that United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277 \n(1943), was controlling. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n273 \n \nRespondent was the only defense witness. He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating",

The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system.

Hurting \nsomeone’s feelings may be more devastating than saying something untrue about him behind his back; yet \nthe law will not provide a remedy for saying something cruel to someone directly, while it may provide a \nremedy for \"defaming\" someone, orally or in writing, to others. \n \nAlthough the word is no longer in general use, tort suits are the stuff of everyday headlines. More and \nmore people injured by exposure to a variety of risks now seek redress (some sort of remedy through the \ncourts). Headlines boast of multimillion-dollar jury awards against doctors who bungled operations, \nagainst newspapers that libeled subjects of stories, and against oil companies that devastate entire \necosystems. All are examples of tort suits. \n \nThe law of torts developed almost entirely in the common-law courts; that is, statutes passed by \nlegislatures were not the source of law that plaintiffs usually relied on. Usually, plaintiffs would rely on the \ncommon law (judicial decisions). Through thousands of cases, the courts have fashioned a series of rules \nthat govern the conduct of individuals in their noncontractual dealings with each other. Through \ncontracts, individuals can craft their own rights and responsibilities toward each other. In the absence of \ncontracts, tort law holds individuals legally accountable for the consequences of their actions. Those who \nsuffer losses at the hands of others can be compensated. \n \nMany acts (like homicide) are both criminal and tortious. But torts and crimes are different, and the \ndifference is worth noting. A crime is an act against the people as a whole. Society punishes the murderer; \nit does not usually compensate the family of the victim. Tort law, on the other hand, views the death as a \nprivate wrong for which damages are owed. In a civil case, the tort victim or his family, not the state, \nbrings the action. The judgment against a defendant in a civil tort suit is usually expressed in monetary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n283 \nterms, not in terms of prison times or fines, and is the legal system’s way of trying to make up for the \nvictim’s loss. \n \nKinds of Torts \nThere are three kinds of torts: intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts. Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions. One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than",

                    "answer": "Intentional torts arise from deliberate actions taken by the defendant, while negligent torts occur due to the defendant's lack of care or attention. In intentional torts, the defendant's fault is clear as they acted with purpose to cause harm. Conversely, negligent torts imply some fault on the defendant's part, but it stems from carelessness or a breach of duty of care, rather than a deliberate intention to cause harm. Strict liability torts, however, differ significantly because they hold the defendant responsible for the victim's losses even in the absence of fault or negligence. This means that the defendant might be held liable for causing harm without needing to prove that they were careless or had intended to cause harm. These three categories—intentional torts, negligent torts, and strict liability torts—form the primary structure of tort law, each addressing different types of harm and the circumstances under which the defendant can be held legally accountable."

Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations. The law in most states permits recovery of punitive damages only when the \ndefendant has deliberately committed a wrong with malicious intent or has otherwise done something \noutrageous. \n \nPunitive damages are rarely allowed in negligence cases for that reason. But if someone sets out \nintentionally and maliciously to hurt another person, punitive damages may well be appropriate. Punitive \ndamages are intended not only to punish the wrongdoer, by exacting an additional and sometimes heavy \npayment (the exact amount is left to the discretion of jury and judge), but also to deter others from similar \nconduct. The punitive damage award has been subject to heavy criticism in recent years in cases in which \nit has been awarded against manufacturers. One fear is that huge damage awards on behalf of a multitude \nof victims could swiftly bankrupt the defendant. Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are \ntaxable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are three kinds of torts, and in two of them (negligent torts and strict liability torts), damages are \nusually limited to making the victim whole through an enforceable judgment for money damages. These \ncompensatory damages awarded by a court accomplish only approximate justice for the injuries or property \ndamage caused by a tortfeasor. Tort laws go a step further toward deterrence, beyond compensation to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n287 \nplaintiff, in occasionally awarding punitive damages against a defendant. These are almost always in cases \nwhere an intentional tort has been committed. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is deterrence needed for intentional torts (where punitive damages are awarded) rather than \nnegligent torts? \n2. Why are costs imposed on others without their consent problematic for a market economy? What if the \nlaw did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor? What would a totally nonlitigious society \nbe like? \n \n \n \n \n7.2 Intentional Torts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Distinguish intentional torts from other kinds of torts. \n2. Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

                    "answer": "Compensatory damages are monetary awards given by a court to make the victim whole for injuries or property damage caused by a tortfeasor. These damages aim to compensate for the losses suffered by the injured party, such as replacement of destroyed property, lost wages, medical expenses, and pain. They are meant to provide approximate justice for the injuries or property damage caused. On the other hand, punitive damages are awarded to punish the defendant for particularly egregious behavior and to deter similar conduct in the future. Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are not strictly tied to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff and are typically only awarded in cases where the defendant has acted with deliberate malice or outrageous conduct. Therefore, while compensatory damages focus on restitution and compensation, punitive damages aim to serve as a deterrent and exact a heavier payment from the defendant."

Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n294 \nAbsolute Privilege \nStatements made during the course of judicial proceedings are absolutely privileged, meaning that they \ncannot serve as the basis for a defamation suit. Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find \nthemselves the objects of public scrutiny. Whether a private person is or is not a public figure is a difficult \nquestion that has so far eluded rigorous definition and has been answered only from case to case. A CEO \nof a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private figure unless he puts himself in the public \neye—for example, by starring in the company’s television commercials. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n295 \n \nInvasion of Privacy \nThe right of privacy—the right “to be let alone”—did not receive judicial recognition until the twentieth \ncentury, and its legal formulation is still evolving. In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country. Deciding what “commercial” or \n“trade” purposes are is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its",

Sullivan that under the First Amendment, a libel lawsuit brought against a newspaper by a public official cannot succeed unless the plaintiff demonstrates 'actual malice.' This term was defined as either knowing that the statement was false or acting with reckless disregard regarding its truthfulness. Subsequent cases extended this constitutional principle to cover public figures, individuals who have placed themselves in the public spotlight through voluntary actions or involuntary exposure to public scrutiny. Determining whether a private individual qualifies as a public figure remains a complex issue without a definitive legal standard, often decided on a case-by-case basis. For example, the CEO of a private corporation would typically be considered a private figure unless they actively engaged in public activities, such as appearing in the company's television advertisements."

The general rule is that if the facts are truly private \nand of no “legitimate” concern to the public, then their disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy. But \na person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection. \n \nFalse Light \nA final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false, it might \nnot be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication \nmight even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is.

[Citations] \n“The court determines, as a matter of law, the existence and scope of the duty—that is, whether the \nplaintiff’s interest that has been infringed by the conduct of the defendant is entitled to legal protection.” \n[Citations] In Smith v. City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to \nbe considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n315 \nWhether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for \nexample, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the \nsocial utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or \nharm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor. \n \n…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those \nconsiderations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” \n… \nWe believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent \naffirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University \nunder the facts of this case. In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties.

By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading \nbranches of the common law. Disturbed by the profusion of cases and the resulting uncertainty of the law, \na group of prominent American judges, lawyers, and teachers founded the American law Institute in 1923 \nto attempt to clarify, simplify, and improve the law. One of its first projects, and ultimately one of its most \nsuccessful, was the drafting of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts, completed in 1932. A \nrevision—the Restatement (Second) of Contracts—was undertaken in 1946 and finally completed in 1979. \nThe Restatements (others exist in the fields of torts, agency, conflicts of laws, judgments, property, \nrestitution, security, and trusts) are detailed analyses of the decided cases in the field. These analyses are \nmade with an eye to discerning the various principles that have emerged from the courts, and to the \nmaximum extent possible, the Restatements declare the law as the courts have determined it to be. The \nRestatements, guided by a Reporter (the director of the project) and a staff of legal scholars, go through \nseveral so-called “tentative” drafts—sometimes as many as fifteen or twenty—and are screened by various \ncommittees within the American Law Institute before they are eventually published as final documents. \n \nThe Restatement of Contracts won prompt respect in the courts and has been cited in innumerable cases. \nThe Restatements are not authoritative, in the sense that they are not actual judicial precedents, but they \nare nevertheless weighty interpretive texts, and judges frequently look to them for guidance. They are as \nclose to “black letter” rules of law as exist anywhere in the American legal system for judge-made \n(common) law. \n \nStatutory Law: The Uniform Commercial Code \nCommon law contract principles govern contracts for real estate and for services, obviously very \nimportant areas of law. But in one area the common law has been superseded by an important statute: the \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC), especially Article 2, which deals with the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n332 \nA Brief History \nThe UCC is a model law developed by the American law Institute and the National Conference of \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws; it has been adopted in one form or another in all fifty states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the American territories. It is the only “national” law not enacted by Congress. \n \nBefore the UCC was written, commercial law varied, sometimes greatly, from state to state. This first \nproved a nuisance and then a serious impediment to business as the American economy became \nnationwide during the twentieth century. Although there had been some uniform laws concerned with \ncommercial deals—including the Uniform Sales Act, first published in 1906—few were widely adopted and \nnone nationally. As a result, the law governing sales of goods, negotiable instruments, warehouse receipts, \nsecurities, and other matters crucial to doing business in an industrial, market economy was a crazy quilt \nof untidy provisions that did not mesh well from state to state. \n \nInitial drafting of the UCC began in 1942 and was ten years in the making, involving the efforts of \nhundreds of practicing lawyers, law teachers, and judges. A final draft, promulgated by the Institute and \nthe Conference, was endorsed by the American Bar Association and published in 1951. \n \nPennsylvania enacted the code in its entirety in 1953. It was the only state to enact the original version, \nbecause the Law Revision Commission of the New York State legislature began to examine it line by line \nand had serious objections. Three years later, in 1956, a revised code was issued. This version, known as \nthe 1957 Official Text, was enacted in Massachusetts and Kentucky. In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted",

UCC Section 2·314(1) states that any seller who is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n335 \nregularly a merchant of the goods sold impliedly warrants their merchantability in a contract for their \nsale. This section explicitly declares that serving food or drink is a sale, whether they are to be consumed \non or off the premises. \n \nThe second type of case involves blood transfusions, which can give a patient hepatitis, a serious and \nsometimes fatal disease. Hospitals and blood banks obviously face large potential liability under the UCC \nprovision just referred to on implied warranty of merchantability. Because medical techniques cannot \ndetect the hepatitis virus in any form of blood used, hospitals and blood banks would be in constant \njeopardy, without being able to take effective action to minimize the danger. Most states have enacted \nlegislation specifically providing that blood supplies to be used in transfusions are a service, not goods, \nthus relieving the suppliers and hospitals of an onerous burden. \n \nThree Basic Contract Types: Sources of Law \nWith this brief description of the UCC, it should now be clear that the primary sources of law for the three \nbasic types of contracts are: \n \n• \nReal estate: common law; \n• \nServices: common law; \n• \nSale of goods: UCC (as interpreted by the courts). \n \nCommon law and UCC rules are often similar. For example, both require good faith in the performance of \na contract. However, there are two general differences worth noting between the common law of contracts \nand the UCC’s rules governing the sales of goods. First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in \nupholding the existence of a contract. For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” \nterms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was \nmade. However, open terms in a nonsales contract will frequently result in a ruling that there is no \ncontract. Second, although the common law of contracts applies to every person equally, under the UCC \n“merchants” occasionally receive special treatment. By “merchants” the UCC means persons who have \nspecial knowledge or skill who deal in the goods involved in the transaction. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n336 \n \nThe Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods \nA Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) was approved in 1980 at \na diplomatic conference in Vienna. (A convention is a preliminary agreement that serves as the basis for a \nformal treaty.) The Convention has been adopted by several countries, including the United States. \n \nThe Convention is significant for three reasons. First, the Convention is a uniform law governing the sale \nof goods—in effect, an international Uniform Commercial Code. The major goal of the drafters was to \nproduce a uniform law acceptable to countries with different legal, social and economic systems. Second, \nalthough provisions in the Convention are generally consistent with the UCC, there are significant \ndifferences. For instance, under the Convention, consideration (discussed below) is not required to form a \ncontract and there is no Statute of Frauds (a requirement that some contracts be evidenced by a writing to \nbe enforceable—also discussed below). Finally, the Convention represents the first attempt by the US \nSenate to reform the private law of business through its treaty powers, for the Convention preempts the \nUCC if the parties to a contract elect to use the CISG. \n \nBasic Contract Taxonomy \nContracts are not all cut from the same die. Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only",

This suggests that when cosmetics like permanent wave lotion are sold for personal use, they come with an inherent guarantee that they will perform as intended for such purposes. However, the case also clarifies that even if a service provider uses these products during a service (such as applying them to a customer’s hair), the provider still carries the liability for any harm caused, as opposed to merely selling the product without application."

                    "answer": "State legislatures address the distinction between goods and services in restaurant cases and blood transfusions by enacting specific legislation rather than leaving it to judicial interpretation. For restaurant cases, UCC Section 2·314(1) explicitly declares that serving food or drink, whether for on-premises or off-premises consumption, constitutes a sale and thus implies a warranty of merchantability. This means that restaurants are considered merchants and must ensure the food they serve is fit for consumption. In the case of blood transfusions, most states have enacted laws to classify blood supplies for transfusions as services rather than goods, thereby shielding blood banks and hospitals from the onerous burden of implied warranties of merchantability that could arise from the use of potentially contaminated blood. This legislative approach aims to protect healthcare providers from excessive liability while ensuring patient safety."

            "chunk": "the adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you. \nA voidable contract remains a valid contract until it is voided. Thus, a contract with a minor remains in \nforce unless the minor decides he does not wish to be bound by it. When the minor reaches his majority, \nhe may “ratify” the contract—that is, agree to be bound by it-in which case the contract will no longer be \nvoidable and will thereafter be fully enforceable. \n \nAn unenforceable contract is one that some rule of law bars a court from enforcing. For example, Tom \nowes Pete money, but Pete has waited too long to collect it and the statute of limitations has run out. The \ncontract for repayment is unenforceable and Pete is out of luck, unless Tom makes a new promise to pay \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n339 \nor actually pays part of the debt. (However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n340 \n1.

However, if the creditor receives a new promise from the debtor to pay, or if the debtor makes partial payment, the contract can potentially become enforceable again. Additionally, if the creditor holds collateral as security for the debt, they are generally entitled to retain it even if the contract itself is unenforceable, as the collateral serves as a separate form of security that is not extinguished by the unenforceability of the contract."

The parties entered into the contract with capacity to make a contract; and \n5. The agreement is in the proper form (something in writing, if required). \n \nThe Agreement: Offer and Acceptance \nThe core of a legal contract is the agreement between the parties. That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment. The company refused, claiming that the statement was made \nin jest (the audience before the commission had laughed when the offer was made). The court disagreed, \nholding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: \n \n(I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, \nthen the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended. It is the objective \nmanifestations of the offeror that count and not secret, unexpressed intentions. If a party’s words \nor acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree in regard to the matter \nin question, that agreement is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real but \nunexpressed state of the party’s mind on the subject. [1] \n \nAn offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain such that it would be reasonable for \nanother individual to conclude that assent to the offer would complete the bargain. Offers must be \ncommunicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent. \n \nTo constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance of the offer. The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the",

For example, the use of the postal \nservice was so customary that acceptances are considered effective when mailed, regardless of the method \nused to transmit the offer. Indeed, the so-called “mailbox rule” (the acceptance is effective upon dispatch) \nhas an ancient lineage, tracing back nearly two hundred years to the English courts. [2] \nConsideration \nConsideration, is the quid pro quo (something given or received for something else) between the \ncontracting parties in the absence of which the law will not enforce the promise or promises made. \nConsider the following three “contracts”: \n \n1. Betty offers to give a book to Lou. Lou accepts. \n2. Betty offers Lou the book in exchange for Lou’s promise to pay $15. Lou accepts. \n3. Betty offers to give Lou the book if Lou promises to pick it up at Betty’s house. Lou accepts. \n \nThe question is which, if any, is a binding contract? In American law, only situation 2 is a binding \ncontract, because only that contract contains a set of mutual promises in which each party pledges to give \nup something to the benefit of the other. \n \nThe question of what constitutes a binding contract has been answered differently throughout history and \nin other cultures. For example, under Roman law, any contract that was reduced to writing was binding, \nwhether or not there was consideration in our sense. Moreover, in later Roman times, certain promises of \ngifts were made binding, whether written or oral; these would not be binding in the United States. And in \nthe Anglo-American tradition, the presence of a seal was once sufficient to make a contract binding \nwithout any other consideration. In most states, the seal is no longer a substitute for consideration, \nalthough in some states it creates a presumption of consideration. The Uniform Commercial Code has \nabolished the seal on contracts for the sale of goods. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n344 \nThe existence of consideration is determined by examining whether the person against whom a promise is \nto be enforced (the promisor) received something in return from the person to whom he made the \npromise (the promisee). That may seem a simple enough question. But as with much in the law, the \ncomplicating situations are never very far away. The “something” that is promised or delivered cannot just \nbe anything: a feeling of pride, warmth, amusement, friendship; it must be something known as \na legal detriment—an act, a forbearance, or a promise of such from the promisee. The detriment need \nnot be an actual detriment; it may in fact be a benefit to the promisee, or at least not a loss. At the same \ntime, the “detriment” to the promisee need not confer a tangible benefit on the promisor; the promisee \ncan agree to forego something without that something being given to the promisor. Whether \nconsideration is legally sufficient has nothing to do with whether it is morally or economically adequate to \nmake the bargain a fair one. Moreover, legal consideration need not even be certain; it can be a promise \ncontingent on an event that may never happen. Consideration is a legal concept, and it centers on the \ngiving up of a legal right or benefit. \n \nConsideration has two elements. The first, as just outlined, is whether the promisee has incurred a legal \ndetriment. (Some courts—although a minority—take the view that a bargained-for legal benefit to the \npromisor is sufficient consideration.) The second is whether the legal detriment was bargained for: did \nthe promisor specifically intend the act, forbearance, or promise in return for his promise? Applying this \ntwo-pronged test to the three examples given at the outset of the chapter, we can easily see why only in the \nsecond is there legally sufficient consideration. In the first, Lou incurred no legal detriment; he made no \npledge to act or to forbear from acting, nor did he in fact act or forbear from acting. In the third example, \nwhat might appear to be such a promise is not really so. Betty made a promise on a condition that Lou \ncome to her house; the intent clearly is to make a gift. Betty was not seeking to induce Lou to come to her \nhouse by promising the book.",

                    "answer": "Elke may or may not be entitled to payment depending on the specific circumstances and jurisdiction. Generally, when someone prepares a will, there is an implied contract that the person receiving the will (in this case, Matthew) will compensate the preparer (Elke) for their services. However, if Matthew explicitly refused to pay her, and there is no written agreement stating the terms of payment, Elke's entitlement to payment could be disputed. Courts typically consider whether there was a mutual understanding or agreement regarding compensation, and whether Elke provided sufficient services to warrant payment. If the refusal to pay was arbitrary or malicious, Elke might have grounds to sue for breach of the implied contract."

                    "answer": "The release form signed by Sara Hohe and her father likely did not protect the school district and hypnotist from liability in the event of injury during the hypnotism show. The release form is generally considered a contract between the signatories, but it may be voided if it goes against public policy. In this case, allowing a school to sponsor a hypnotism show that could potentially cause harm to students may be seen as against public policy. Additionally, the fact that Sara had seen previous shows and was selected at random suggests that the risks were not adequately disclosed or managed. Therefore, the release form may not be enforceable, and the school district could still be held liable for any injuries caused during the show."

            "chunk": "the Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from \ncoverage accidents involving employees of the insureds. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which",

                    "answer": "The case General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. Pro Golf Association [3] addresses the critical distinction between an employee and an independent contractor in the context of personal liability insurance policies. Specifically, it examines whether an individual, such as Gerald Hall, who was employed by the local park department but engaged a young boy named Bradley Martin to 'shag' golf balls for compensation, was considered an employee under the insurance policy. The policy excluded bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment. When a golf ball hit young Martin in the eye during a lesson, the insurance company's liability hinged on whether Martin was considered an employee. The trial court determined that Martin was not an employee due to the ambiguity in his compensation, lack of direction, and minimal control over his actions, indicating that the determination of employee status can significantly impact insurance coverage and liability."

                    "question": "How does the law typically treat gratuitous agencies and what are the implications of oral agency contracts?",
                    "answer": "Gratuitous agencies, where one person acts as an agent for another without receiving consideration, are generally treated similarly to contractual agencies in terms of their legal outcomes. However, the absence of consideration means that the principal may not have the same level of control over the agent's actions as in a traditional contractual agency. Oral agency contracts are legally binding, though they do not require formal documentation like written contracts. Practically, many agency agreements are written to prevent disputes over the terms and conditions. Nevertheless, there are specific instances where an oral agency contract must be in writing, such as when the agency cannot be completed within a year, when it involves paying commissions to real estate brokers, when an agent is given authority to sell real estate, or when it pertains to contracts between companies and sales representatives. Despite this, even if the contract itself is not required to be in writing, contracts made by agents with third parties often must be in writing, as exemplified by Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which mandates written contracts for the sale of goods valued at $500 or more."

            "chunk": "other general duties as recognized in agency law. \n2. Recognize that the principal owes the agent duties: contract, tort, and workers’ compensation. \n \n \nAgent’s Duty to Principal \nThe agent owes the principal duties in two categories: the fiduciary duty and a set of general duties \nimposed by agency law. But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course. \n \nBut the agency relationship is more than a contractual one, and the agent’s responsibilities go beyond the \nborder of the contract. Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest. The penalty for \nbreach of fiduciary duty is loss of compensation and profit and possible damages for breach of trust. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n383 \n \nDuty to Preserve Confidential Information \nTo further his objectives, a principal will usually need to reveal a number of secrets to his agent—how \nmuch he is willing to sell or pay for property, marketing strategies, and the like. Such information could \neasily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or \nwere to sell the information to those who do. The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own \npurposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or \nacquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the \nagent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books \nor memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s \nexpense.” [1] Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency. Though he is free, \nin the absence of contract, to compete with his former principal, he may not use information learned in \nthe course of his agency, such as trade secrets and customer lists. Section 9.3.3 \"Breach of Fiduciary \nDuty\", Bacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc., deals with an agent’s breach of the duty of confidentiality. \n \nOther Duties \nIn addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific \ncontract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to \nagents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts. \n \nDuty of Skill and Care \nAn agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. \nThe agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality \nfor the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are \ngreater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community. In short, \nthe agent may not lawfully do a sloppy job. [2] \n \nDuty of Good Conduct \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n384 \nIn the absence of an agreement, a principal may not ordinarily dictate how an agent must live his private \nlife. An overly fastidious florist may not instruct her truck driver to steer clear of the local bar on his way \nhome from delivering flowers at the end of the day. But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars. A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized",

Unlike a nonagency contractual situation where parties' responsibilities terminate at the contract's borders, the agency relationship imposes a fiduciary duty, which means the agent stands in a position of special trust and must subordinate their self-interest to that of the principal. The absence of a clause detailing the agent's fiduciary duty in the contract does not absolve them of this duty. The fiduciary responsibility includes several aspects such as avoiding self-dealing, preserving confidential information, and performing work with the required skill and care.

These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its \nexpense” may be used by the company without payment of royalties: “Because the servant uses his \nmaster’s time, facilities and materials to attain a concrete result, the employer is entitled to use that which \nembodies his own property and to duplicate it as often as he may find occasion to employ similar \nappliances in his business.” The company would have been given complete ownership of the patents had \nthere been an express or implied (e.g., the employee is hired to make inventions) contract to this effect \nbetween Sharp and the company. \n \nPrincipal’s Duty to Agent \nIn this category, we may note that the principal owes the agent duties in contract, tort, and—statutorily—\nworkers’ compensation law. \n \nContract Duties \nThe fiduciary relationship of agent to principal does not run in reverse—that is, the principal is not the \nagent’s fiduciary. Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

Additionally, a principal is obligated to provide financial transparency, such as rendering accounts of monies due to agents, depending on various factors like the agent's level of independence, the method of compensation, and business customs.

Microsoft agreed.… \n \nAfter learning of the IRS rulings, the plaintiffs sought various employee benefits, including those now at \nissue: the ESPP and SPP benefits.

The plaintiffs, however, were not freelancers or independent contractors.

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

                    "answer": "According to the court's decision, Microsoft's payment method through the accounts receivable department instead of the payroll department did not demonstrate that the company intended to deny benefits to common-law employees, regardless of their actual employment status. The court held that Microsoft regarded the plaintiffs as independent contractors and only discovered their common-law-employee status after an IRS examination. Therefore, the payment method could not be used as evidence that the company intended to deny benefits to common-law employees, as there was no evidence suggesting that Microsoft ever denied eligibility to any employees whom it understood to be common-law employees, irrespective of how they were paid."

Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits. Thus, we reject Microsoft’s final argument. \n \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Microsoft and denial of \nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for the \ndetermination of any questions of individual eligibility for benefits that may remain following issuance of \nthis opinion and for calculation of the damages or benefits due the various class members. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. In a 1993 Wall Street Journal article, James Bovard asserted that the IRS “is carrying out a sweeping \ncampaign to slash the number of Americans permitted to be self-employed—and to punish the companies \nthat contract with them…IRS officials indicate that more than half the nation’s self-employed should no \nlonger be able to work for themselves.” Why did Microsoft want these employees to “be able to work for \nthemselves”? \n2. Why did the employees accept employment as independent contractors? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n404 \n3. It seems unlikely that the purpose of the IRS’s campaign was really to keep people from working for \nthemselves, despite Mr. Bovard’s assumption. What was the purpose of the campaign? \n4. Why did the IRS and the court determine that these “independent contractors” were in fact employees? \n \n \nBreach of Fiduciary Duty \nBacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc. \n597 S.E.2d 440 (Ga. App. 2004) \n \nSmith, J. \n \n[This appeal is] taken in an action that arose when two former employees left an existing business and \nbegan a new, competing business.…Bacon and Johnson, two former employees of Volvo Service Center, \nInc. (VSC), and the new company they formed, South Gwinnett Volvo Service, Ltd. (SGVS), appeal from \nthe trial court’s denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the jury’s verdict in favor of VSC.… \nVSC filed suit against appellants, alleging a number of claims arising from the use by Bacon, who had \nbeen a service technician at VSC, of VSC’s customer list, and his soliciting Johnson, a service writer, and \nanother VSC employee to join SGVS. SGVS moved for a directed verdict on certain claims at the close of \nplaintiff’s evidence and at the close of the case, which motions were denied. The jury was asked to respond \nto specific interrogatories, and it found for VSC and against all three appellants on VSC’s claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets. The jury also found for plaintiff against Bacon for breach of fiduciary \nduty,…tortious interference with business relations, employee piracy, and conversion of corporate assets. \nThe jury awarded VSC attorney fees, costs, and exemplary damages stemming from the claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets. Judgment was entered on the jury’s verdict, and appellants’ motion for \nj.n.o.v. was denied. This appeal ensued. We find that VSC did not meet its burden of proof as to the claims \nfor misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, or employee piracy, and the trial court \nshould have granted appellants’ motion for j.n.o.v. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n405 \nConstrued to support the jury’s verdict, the evidence of record shows that Bacon was a technician at VSC \nwhen he decided to leave and open a competing business. Before doing so, he printed a list of VSC’s \ncustomers from one of VSC’s two computers. Computer access was not password restricted, was easy to \nuse, and was used by many employees from time to time. \n \nAbout a year after he left VSC, Bacon gave Johnson and another VSC employee an offer of employment at \nhis new Volvo repair shop, which was about to open. Bacon and Johnson advertised extensively, and the \ncustomer list was used to send flyers to some VSC customers who lived close to the new shop’s location. \nThese activities became the basis for VSC’s action against Bacon, Johnson, and their new shop, SGVS.… \n \n1. The Georgia Trade Secrets Act of 1990, [Citation], defines a “trade secret” as \ninformation, without regard to form, including, but not limited to,…a list of actual or potential \ncustomers or suppliers which is not commonly known by or available to the public and which \ninformation: \n(A) Derives economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not \nbeing readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value \nfrom its disclosure or use; and \n(B) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy. \n \nIf an employer does not prove both prongs of this test, it is not entitled to protection under the Act.

Bacon’s actions potentially failed to meet these criteria because the customer list was not password-protected and was easily accessible to many employees. Additionally, the information was not sufficiently protected as it was used by Bacon to solicit customers for his new business, which could indicate a lack of reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.

With regard to VSC’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty, “[a]n employee breaches no fiduciary duty to \nthe employer simply by making plans to enter a competing business while he is still employed. Even \nbefore the termination of his agency, he is entitled to make arrangements to compete and upon \ntermination of employment immediately compete.” [Citation] He cannot solicit customers for a rival \nbusiness or do other, similar acts in direct competition with his employer’s business before his \nemployment ends. But here, no evidence was presented to rebut the evidence given by Bacon and Johnson \nthat they engaged in no such practices before their employment with VSC ended.

The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the \nmeaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Law. \n \nSince there is no statutory definition of this term we turn to the relevant decisions. These may be divided \ninto three categories: (1) psychic trauma which produces physical injury, (2) physical impact which \nproduces psychological injury, and (3) psychic trauma which produces psychological injury. As to the first \nclass our court has consistently recognized the principle that an injury caused by emotional stress or \nshock may be accidental within the purview of the compensation law.

First, as noted in the \npsychiatric testimony there is nothing in the nature of a stress or shock situation which ordains physical \nas opposed to psychological injury. The determinative factor is the particular vulnerability of an individual \nby virtue of his physical makeup. In a given situation one person may be susceptible to a heart attack \nwhile another may suffer a depressive reaction. In either case the result is the same—the individual is \nincapable of functioning properly because of an accident and should be compensated under the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Law. \n \nSecondly, having recognized the reliability of identifying psychic trauma as a causative factor of injury in \nsome cases and the reliability by identifying psychological injury as a resultant factor in other cases, we \nsee no reason for limiting recovery in the latter instance to cases involving physical impact. There is \nnothing talismanic about physical impact. \n \nWe would note in passing that this analysis reflects the view of the majority of jurisdictions in this country \nand England.

Why did the appeals court deny workers’ compensation benefits for Wolfe? \n2. On what reasoning did the New York high court reverse? \n3. There was a dissent in this case (not included here). Judge Breitel noted that the evidence was that Mrs. \nWolfe had a psychological condition such that her trauma “could never have occurred unless she, to begin \nwith, was extraordinarily vulnerable to severe shock at or away from her place of employment or one \nproduced by accident or injury to those close to her in employment or in her private life.” The judge \nworried that “one can easily call up a myriad of commonplace occupational pursuits where employees are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n411 \noften exposed to the misfortunes of others which may in the mentally unstable evoke precisely the \nsymptoms which this claimant suffered.” He concluded, “In an era marked by examples of overburdening of \nsocially desirable programs with resultant curtailment or destruction of such programs, a realistic \nassessment of impact of doctrine is imperative. An overburdening of the compensation system by \ninjudicious and open-ended expansion of compensation benefits, especially for costly, prolonged, and often \nonly ameliorative psychiatric care, cannot but threaten its soundness or that of the enterprises upon which \nit depends.” What is the concern here? \n \n \n \n \n9.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another.

Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form. The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal. One common form of express authority is the standard \nsignature card on file with banks allowing corporate agents to write checks on the company’s credit. The \nprincipal bears the risk of any wrongful action of his agent, as demonstrated in Allen A. Funt Productions, \nInc. v. Chemical Bank. [1] Allen A. Funt submitted to his bank through his production company various \ncertificates permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts. [2] In fact, for several years \nthe accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in \nhis own account. The company sued its bank, charging it with negligence, apparently for failing to monitor \nthe amount of money taken by the accountant. But the court dismissed the negligence complaint, citing a \nstate statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express \nauthorization given to an agent; in this case, the accountant drew checks on the account within the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n418 \nmonetary limits contained in the signature cards on file with the bank. Letters of introduction and work \norders are other types of express authority. \n \nFigure 10.1 Types of Authority \n \n \nImplied Authority \nNot every detail of an agent’s work can be spelled out. It is impossible to delineate step-by-step the duties \nof a general agent; at best, a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties that the agent is \nto perform. Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a",

                    "answer": "Express authority is the strongest form of authority in an agency relationship, often granted in written form, where the principal consents to the agent's actions. This type of authority provides clear documentation that the agent is authorized to act on behalf of the principal, which allows the third party to rely on this written authorization. In the Allen A. Funt Productions, Inc. v. Chemical Bank case, Allen A. Funt submitted certificates to his bank permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts, which is a common form of express authority. The principal bears the risk of any wrongful action of their agent, as demonstrated in this case where the accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in his own account. Despite the bank's negligence in monitoring the amount of money taken, the court cited a state statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express authorization given to an agent. Therefore, express authority protects both the principal by holding them responsible for the actions of their authorized agent and the third party by ensuring they can confidently rely on the agent's authority."

On September 3, Central received a letter from \nMeggs notifying it of Meggs’s sale of the business to Buyer. Buyer failed to pay Central, which sued Meggs. \nThe court held that Rose City Sheet Metal Works had apparent authority to buy on Meggs’s credit; Meggs \nwas liable for supplies purchased between July 10 and September 3.

Hancock Bank & Trust Company in Section 10.4.1 \"Implied Authority\". \n \nRatification \nEven if the agent possessed no actual authority and there was no apparent authority on which the third \nperson could rely, the principal may still be liable if he ratifies or adopts the agent’s acts before the third \nperson withdraws from the contract. Ratification usually relates back to the time of the undertaking, \ncreating authority after the fact as though it had been established initially. Ratification is a voluntary act \nby the principal. Faced with the results of action purportedly done on his behalf but without authorization \nand through no fault of his own, he may affirm or disavow them as he chooses. To ratify, the principal may \ntell the parties concerned or by his conduct manifest that he is willing to accept the results as though the \nact were authorized. Or by his silence he may find under certain circumstances that he has ratified. Note \nthat ratification does not require the usual consideration of contract law. The principal need be promised \nnothing extra for his decision to affirm to be binding on him. Nor does ratification depend on the position \nof the third party; for example, a loss stemming from his reliance on the agent’s representations is not \nrequired. In most situations, ratification leaves the parties where they expected to be, correcting the \nagent’s errors harmlessly and giving each party what was expected. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n422 \n \nThe principal is liable on an agent’s contract only if the agent was authorized by the principal to make the \ncontract. Such authority is express, implied, or apparent. Express means made in words, orally or in \nwriting; implied means the agent has authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to \ncarrying out the transaction for which she has express authority. Apparent authority arises where the principal \ngives the third party reason to believe that the agent had authority. The reasonableness of the third party’s \nbelief is based on all the circumstances—all the facts. Even if the agent has no authority, the principal may, \nafter the fact, ratify the contract made by the agent. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

            "chunk": "the principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions \nfall into a category of duties that the law deems nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated \nto provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do so results in liability whether or not the \nharm befell the other because of an independent contractor’s wrongdoing. Thus a homeowner has a duty \nto ensure that physical conditions in and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous. If the owner \nhires an independent contracting firm to dig a sewer line and the contractor negligently fails to guard \npassersby against the danger of falling into an open trench, the homeowner is liable because the duty of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n426 \ncare in this instance cannot be delegated. (The contractor is, of course, liable to the homeowner for any \ndamages paid to an injured passerby.) \n \nLiability for Agent’s Intentional Torts \nIn the nineteenth century, a principal was rarely held liable for intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the \nprincipal did not command the act complained of. The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison. [1] The plaintiff was run over on a highway \nby a speeding cart and horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply.

Suppose he decides to stop by the beach, which is far away from his route. Does it \nmake a difference if the employer knows that his deliverymen do this? \n \nThe Zone of Risk Test \nCourt decisions in the last forty years have moved toward a different standard, one that looks to the \nforeseeability of the agent’s conduct. By this standard, an employer may be held liable for his employee’s \nconduct even when devoted entirely to the employee’s own purposes, as long as it was foreseeable that the \nagent might act as he did. This is the “zone of risk” test. The employer will be within the zone of risk for \nvicarious liability if the employee is where she is supposed to be, doing—more or less—what she is \nsupposed to be doing, and the incident arose from the employee’s pursuit of the employer’s interest \n(again, more or less). That is, the employer is within the zone of risk if the servant is in the place within \nwhich, if the master were to send out a search party to find a missing employee, it would be reasonable to \nlook. See Section 4, Cockrell v. Pearl River Valley Water Supply Dist. \n \nSpecial Cases of Vicarious Liability \nVicarious liability is not limited to harm caused in the course of an agency relationship. It may also be \nimposed in other areas, including torts of family members, and other torts governed by statute or \nregulation.

Is the owner liable? In many states, the \nowner is not liable; in other states, however, two approaches impose liability on the owner. \nThe first approach is legislative: owner’s consent statutes make the owner liable when the automobile \nis being driven with his consent or knowledge. The second approach to placing liability on the owner is \njudicial and known as the family purpose doctrine. Under this doctrine, a family member who \nnegligently injures someone with the car subjects the owner to liability if the family member was \nfurthering family purposes. These are loosely defined to include virtually every use to which a child, for \nexample, might put a car. In a Georgia case, Dixon v. Phillips, the father allowed his minor son to drive \nthe car but expressly forbade him from letting anyone else do so. [2] Nevertheless, the son gave the wheel \nto a friend and a collision occurred while both were in the car. The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]). This ancient view has been abrogated by statute or by court ruling in all the states, so \nthat now a wife is solely responsible for her own torts unless she in fact serves as her husband’s agent. \n \nUnlike wives, children are not presumed at common law to be agents or extensions of the father so that \nnormally parents are not vicariously liable for their children’s torts. However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the",

When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership. There are also limited partnerships \nand limited liability partnerships, which are discussed in Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nTable 11.1 Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and Limited Liability \nCompanies \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nTotal number of active partnerships \n2,375,375 \n2,546,877 \n2,763,625 \n2,947,116 \nNumber of partners \n14,108,458 15,556,553 16,211,908 16,727,803 \nNumber of limited partnerships \n378,921 \n402,238 \n413,712 \n432,550 \nNumber of partners \n6,262,103 \n7,023,921 \n6,946,986 \n6,738,737 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n458 \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006 \nNumber of limited liability companies 1,091,502 \n1,270,236 \n1,465,223 \n1,630,161 \nNumber of partners \n4,226,099 \n4,949,808 \n5,640,146 \n6,361,958 \nSource: IRS, http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/09sprbul.pdf. \n \nPartnerships are also popular as investment vehicles. Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to \nput capital into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without liability for the acts of the general \npartners. \n \nEven if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be important to understand the law that \ngoverns it. Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order. An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and \nfurther amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-\nnine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, \nwhere RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered. [2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a \npartnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.” [3] \n \nEntity Theory \nMeaning of “Legal Entity” \nA significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to \nwhether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the \nlaw recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, \nand to enter into contracts; the entity theory is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with \nexistence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an",

                    "question": "What are the key differences between the original 1914 Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) of 1997, particularly in terms of how they address smaller, informal partnerships?",
                    "answer": "The key differences between the original 1914 Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) of 1997, especially concerning smaller, informal partnerships, lie in their approach to default rules and the nature of legal entities. While the UPA provided a framework for partnerships, it was often criticized for being overly complex and not well-suited to smaller, less formal partnerships. RUPA, on the other hand, focuses on providing a set of default rules that govern the relationships among partners in situations where a partnership agreement has not been specifically addressed. This is particularly beneficial for smaller, informal partnerships, as it offers a clear and straightforward set of guidelines without the need for extensive documentation. Moreover, RUPA emphasizes the entity theory, treating the partnership as a distinct legal entity, which simplifies the management and accountability of the business. This shift towards a more simplified and flexible approach in RUPA reflects a recognition of the diverse nature of partnerships and aims to provide a more practical solution for smaller, less formal enterprises."

            "chunk": "2. That was one of two arguments by the dissent in this case. The second one was based on this problem: \nShanahan and Loomis agreed that the cattle at issue were partnership cattle bearing the “52” brand. That \nis, the cows were not Shanahan’s; they were the partnership’s. When Whitehead moved to dismiss \nShanahan’s claim—again, because the cows weren’t Shanahan’s—Shanahan conceded that but for the \nexistence of the partnership he would have no claim against Whitehead. If there is no claim against the \ndefendant except insofar as he harmed the partnership business (the cattle), how could the majority assert \nthat claims against Whitehead did not arise out of “the business” conducted under 52 Cattle Company? \nWho has the better argument, the majority or the dissent? \n3. Here is another problem along the same lines but with a different set of facts and a Uniform Partnership \nAct (UPA) jurisdiction (i.e., pre–Revised Uniform Partnership Act [RUPA]). Suppose the plaintiffs had a \npartnership (as they did here), but the claim by one was that the other partner had stolen several head of \ncattle, and UPA was in effect so that the partnership property was owned as “tenant in partnership”—the \ncattle would be owned by the partners as a whole. A person who steals his own property cannot be \ncriminally liable; therefore, a partner cannot be guilty of stealing (or misappropriating) firm property. Thus \nunder UPA there arise anomalous cases, for example, in People v. Zinke, 555 N.E.2d 263 (N.Y. 1990), which \nis a criminal case, Zinke embezzled over a million dollars from his own investment firm but the prosecutor’s \ncase against him was dismissed because, the New York court said, “partners cannot be prosecuted for \nstealing firm property.” If the partnership is a legal entity, as under RUPA, how is this result changed? \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n480 \n \nPartnership by Estoppel \nChavers v. Epsco, Inc. \n98 S.W.3d 421 (Ark. 2003) \n \nHannah, J. \nAppellants Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers appeal a judgment entered against them by the Craighead \nCounty Circuit Court. Reggie and Mark argue that the trial court erred in holding them liable for a \ncompany debt based upon partnership by estoppel because the proof was vague and insufficient and there \nwas no detrimental reliance on the part of a creditor. We hold that the trial court was not clearly \nerroneous in finding liability based upon partnership by estoppel. Accordingly, we affirm. \n \nFacts \nGary Chavers operated Chavers Welding and Construction (“CWC”), a construction and welding business, \nin Jonesboro. Gary’s sons Reggie Chavers and Mark Chavers joined their father in the business after \ngraduating from high school. Gary, Mark, and Reggie maintain that CWC was a sole proprietorship owned \nby Gary, and that Reggie and Mark served only as CWC employees, not as CWC partners. \n \nIn February 1999, CWC entered into an agreement with Epsco, Inc. (“Epsco”), a staffing service, to \nprovide payroll and employee services for CWC. Initially, Epsco collected payments for its services on a \nweekly basis, but later, Epsco extended credit to CWC. Melton Clegg, President of Epsco, stated that his \ndecision to extend credit to CWC was based, in part, on his belief that CWC was a partnership. \n \nCWC’s account with Epsco became delinquent, and Epsco filed a complaint against Gary, Reggie, and \nMark, individually, and doing business as CWC, to recover payment for the past due account. Gary \ndischarged a portion of his obligation to Epsco due to his filing for bankruptcy. Epsco sought to recover \nCWC’s remaining debt from Reggie and Mark. After a hearing on March 7, 2002, the trial court issued a \nletter opinion, finding that Reggie and Mark “represented themselves to [Epsco] as partners in an existing \npartnership and operated in such a fashion to give creditors in general, and Epsco in particular, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n481 \nimpression that such creditors/potential creditors were doing business with a partnership.…” On May 21, \n2002, the trial court entered an order stating that Reggie and Mark were partners by estoppel as relates to \nEpsco. The trial court found that Reggie and Mark were jointly and severally liable for the debt of CWC in \nthe amount of $80,360.92. In addition, the trial court awarded Epsco pre-judgment interest at the rate of \nsix percent, post-judgment interest at the rate of ten percent, and attorney’s fees in the amount of \n$8,036.92. \n \n[The relevant Arkansas statute provides]: \n \n(1) When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to \nanother representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one (1) or \nmore persons not actual partners, he is liable to any person to whom such representation has \nbeen made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent \npartnership, and if he has made such representation or consented to its being made in a public",

                    "question": "In the case of Shanahan's claim against Whitehead, how does the partnership structure affect the claim and what is the majority's argument compared to the dissent's?",
                    "answer": "The partnership structure plays a significant role in determining whether Shanahan can make a claim against Whitehead. Since the cattle in question were partnership cattle, Shanahan did not personally own them; rather, they belonged to the partnership. Therefore, when Whitehead moved to dismiss Shanahan's claim, Shanahan conceded that the cows were not his personal property. The majority argued that claims against Whitehead did not arise out of 'the business' conducted under 52 Cattle Company because the claim was based on harm to the partnership, not directly to Shanahan. However, the dissent argued that since Shanahan's claim was predicated on the partnership's interests and he would not have had a claim without the partnership, the claim did indeed arise out of the partnership's business. The dissent contended that the majority's interpretation ignored the fact that the partnership's business was harmed, and thus, the claim should be considered to have arisen from the partnership's activities."

                    "answer": "The application of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) versus the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) significantly impacts the criminal liability of a partner who steals firm property. Under UPA, the partnership property is owned as 'tenant in partnership,' meaning the cattle are owned by the partners collectively. This leads to an anomalous situation where a partner cannot be criminally liable for stealing his own property. As a result, even if a partner embezzles funds from the partnership, the prosecutor's case might be dismissed because the court may rule that partners cannot be prosecuted for stealing firm property. However, under RUPA, the partnership is treated as a legal entity distinct from its individual partners. This distinction changes the scenario, as it allows for the possibility of criminal prosecution of a partner for misappropriating firm property, thereby addressing the anomaly present under UPA. The significance of this difference lies in the fact that it clarifies the legal boundaries and potential liabilities for partners in a partnership, providing a more consistent framework for both civil and criminal actions involving partnership assets."

This principle affects non-partners because it means they can be held responsible for partnership liabilities even if they are not actual members of the partnership. The doctrine of estoppel prevents fraud on those who extend credit based on the apparent creditworthiness of the partners.

The latter has been adopted by thirty-five states. At common law, a partnership was not a legal entity \nand could not sue or be sued in the partnership name. Partnership law defines a partnership as “an \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.” The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) assumes that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals, but it also applies a \nnumber of rules characteristic of the legal entity theory. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \nassumes a partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule characteristic of the aggregate theory: \nthe partners are ultimately liable for the partnership’s obligations. Thus a partnership may keep business \nrecords as if it were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the partnership name, and may sue and be sued \nin federal court and in many state courts in the partnership name. \n \nPartnerships may be created informally. Among the clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-\nownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3) right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to \nshare liabilities, and (5) manner in which the business is operated. A partnership may also be formed by \nimplication; it may be formed by estoppel when a third party reasonably relies on a representation that a",

                    "answer": "The legal principle allowing a third party to assume a business relationship continues until notified otherwise is known as partnership by estoppel. In the case involving Reggie, the business card listing him as an owner indicated that he was holding himself out as a partner. Since there was no evidence that Reggie informed anyone receiving the business card that the relationship was incorrect or discontinued, any person dealing with the firm on the faith of such representation was entitled to assume the relation continued. This principle applied to Reggie's actions, supporting the trial court's finding that he was holding himself out as a partner and thus estopped from denying liability to Epsco."

                    "answer": "The partnership application form submitted by Reggie to Sukup Manufacturing, which listed 'Gary & Reggie Chavers' as owners of 'Chavers Welding,' directly supported the partnership by estoppel claim. Despite admitting that he signed the dealership application and represented that he was an owner, Reggie dismissed his statement of ownership as mere 'puffery.' However, Epsco argued that the application showed that Reggie was holding himself out to the public as being a partner. Consequently, the trial court determined that the dealership application provided sufficient evidence to support the finding of partnership by estoppel, affirming that the determination was not clearly erroneous."

Able, Baker, and Carr own, as partners, a warehouse. The income from the warehouse during the current \nyear is $300,000, two-thirds of which goes to Able. Who must file a tax return listing this as income, the \npartnership or Able? Who pays the tax, the partnership or Able? \n2. The Havana Club operated in Salt Lake City under a lease running to defendant Dale Bowen, who owned \nthe equipment, furnishings, and inventory. He did not himself work in operating the club. He made an oral \nagreement with Frances Cutler, who had been working for him as a bartender, that she take over the \nmanagement of the club. She was to have the authority and the responsibility for the entire active \nmanagement and operation: to purchase the supplies, pay the bills, keep the books, hire and fire \nemployees, and do whatever else was necessary to run the business. As compensation, the arrangement \nwas for a down-the-middle split; each was to receive $300 per week plus one half of the net profits. This \nwent on for four years until the city took over the building for a redevelopment project. The city offered \nBowen $30,000 as compensation for loss of business while a new location was found for the club. Failing to \nfind a suitable location, the parties decided to terminate the business. Bowen then contended he was \nentitled to the entire $30,000 as the owner, Cutler being an employee only. She sued to recover half as a \npartner. What was the result? Decide and discuss. \n3. Raul, a business student, decided to lease and operate an ice cream stand during his summer vacation. \nBecause he could not afford rent payments, his lessor agreed to take 30 percent of the profits as rent and \nprovide the stand and the parcel of real estate on which it stood. Are the two partners? \n4. Able, Baker, and Carr formed the ABC Partnership in 2001. In 2002 Able gave her three sons, Duncan, Eldon, \nand Frederick, a gift of her 41 percent interest in the partnership to provide money to pay for their college \nexpenses. The sons reported income from the partnership on their individual tax returns, and the \npartnership reported the payment to them on its information return. The sons were listed as partners on \nunaudited balance sheets in 2003, and the 2004 income statement listed them as partners. The sons never \nrequested information about the management of the firm, never attended any meetings or voted, and \nnever attempted to withdraw the firm’s money or even speak with the other partners about the firm. Two \nof the sons didn’t know where the firm was located, but they all once received “management fees” totaling \n$3,000, without any showing of what the “fees” were for. In 2005, the partnership incurred liability for \npension-fund contributions to an employee, and a trustee for the fund asserted that Able's sons were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n489 \npersonally liable under federal law for the money owing because they were partners.

Recognize the duties partners owe each other: duties of service, loyalty, care, obedience, information, and \naccounting. \n2. Identify the rights that partners have, including the rights to distributions of money, to management, to \nchoice of copartners, to property of the partnership, to assign partnership interest, and to enforce duties \nand rights. \n \n \nMost of the rules discussed in this section apply unless otherwise agreed, and they are really intended for \nthe small firm. [1] The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \ndo not dictate what the relations among partners must be; the acts supply rules in the event that the \npartners have not done so for themselves.

If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the \nterm fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply. \n \nDuties Partners Owe Each Other \nAmong the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of \nloyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty \nto account to the partnership.

            "chunk": "furthers the partner’s own interest.” [4] Moreover, the partnership agreement may eliminate the duty of \nloyalty so long as that is not “manifestly unreasonable.” [5] \n \nActivities Affected by the Duty of Loyalty \nThe duty of loyalty means, again, that partners must put the firm’s interest above their own. Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”? Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404. [8] \n \nThe Rights That Partners Have in a Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n496 \nNecessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of",

                    "answer": "The duty of loyalty in a partnership requires partners to prioritize the firm's interests over their personal ones. This duty prohibits partners from competing with the partnership, making secret profits during partnership business, and maintaining the confidentiality of partnership information. However, the duty of care is more nuanced, stemming from agency law and requiring partners to act with the diligence and skill of a reasonably prudent person. Under RUPA Section 404(c), the duty of care is limited to avoiding gross negligence, reckless behavior, intentional misconduct, or knowingly violating the law. While a partner can act loyally yet still negligently, the duty of care focuses on the quality of the actions taken, not just the intentions behind them."

Who is entitled to her share of the specific property, such as inventory, the \nbuilding, and the money in the cash register—her husband and children, or the other partners, Baker and \nCarr? Section 25(1) of UPA declares that the partners hold the partnership property \nas tenants in partnership. As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in \npartnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs. But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499 \nSection 501 of RUPA provides, “A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in \npartnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.” Partnership property \nis owned by the entity; UPA’s concept of tenants in partnership is abolished in favor of adoption of the \nentity theory. The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and \nright to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.” [17] \n \nThis transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, \nSection 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty?

However, the heirs are entitled to the deceased partner's interest in the partnership itself. On the other hand, RUPA adopts the entity theory, abolishing the concept of tenants in partnership. According to RUPA, partnership property is owned by the entity, and a partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in partnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily."

                    "answer": "Under UPA, the assignment of a partner's interest in the partnership does not dissolve the partnership, nor does it entitle the assignee to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership books. The assignee merely receives the assignor's transferable interest, which includes the partner's share of profits and losses and the right to receive distributions. This transferable interest is assignable under UPA, but the partnership remains intact. Conversely, RUPA distinguishes between a partner's interest in the partnership and a partner's transferable interest. A partner's 'transferable interest' means only his share of the profits and losses and the right to receive distributions, i.e., the partner's economic interests. This transferable interest is assignable under RUPA unless the partners agree to restrict transfers. Unlike UPA, RUPA does not automatically dissolve the partnership due to a voluntary assignment. Furthermore, a transferee under RUPA is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled to, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there been no assignment."

[25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and \nfinally (4) to partners for their share of profits (see Figure 12.3 \"Priority Partnership Liabilities under \nRUPA\"). However, RUPA eliminates the distinction between capital and profits when the firm pays \npartners what is owed to them; RUPA Section 807(b) speaks simply of the right of a partner to a \nliquidating distribution. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.3 Priority Partnership Liabilities under RUPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n522 \n \n \nPartners are entitled to share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including \nthose owed to partners, are paid off, although the partnership agreement can state a different share—for \nexample, in proportion to capital contribution. If after winding up there is a net loss, whether capital or \notherwise, each partner must contribute toward it in accordance with his share in the profits, had there \nbeen any, unless the agreement states otherwise. If any of the partners is insolvent or refuses to contribute \nand cannot be sued, the others must contribute their own share to pay off the liabilities and in addition \nmust contribute, in proportion to their share of the profits, the additional amount necessary to pay the \nliabilities of their defaulting partners. \n \nIn the event of insolvency, a court may take possession of both partnership property and individual assets \nof the partners; this again is a big disadvantage to the partnership form. \n \nThe estate of a deceased partner is credited or liable as that partner would have been if she were living at \nthe time of the distribution. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder UPA, the withdrawal of any partner from the partnership causes dissolution; the withdrawal may be \ncaused in accordance with the agreement, in violation of the agreement, by operation of law, or by court \norder. Dissolution terminates the partners’ authority to act for the partnership, except for winding up, but \nremaining partners may decide to carry on as a new partnership or may decide to terminate the firm. If they \ncontinue, the old creditors remain as creditors of the new firm, the former partner remains liable for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n523 \nobligations incurred while she was a partner (she may be liable for debts arising after she left, unless proper \nnotice is given to creditors), and the former partner or her estate is entitled to an accounting and payment for \nthe partnership interest. If the partners move to terminate the firm, winding up begins. \nUnder RUPA, a partner who ceases to be involved in the business is dissociated, but dissociation does not \nnecessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation happens when a partner quits, voluntarily or involuntarily; when a \npartner dies or becomes incompetent; or on request by the firm or a partner upon court order for a partner’s \nwrongful conduct, among other reasons. The dissociated partner loses actual authority to bind the firm but \nremains liable for predissociation obligations and may have lingering authority or lingering liability for two \nyears provided the other party thought the dissociated one was still a partner; a notice of dissociation will, \nafter ninety days, be good against the world as to dissociation and dissolution. If the firm proceeds to \ntermination (though partners can stop the process before its end), the next step is dissolution, which occurs \nby acts of partners, by operation of law, or by court order upon application by a partner if continuing the \nbusiness has become untenable. After dissolution, the only business undertaken is to wind up affairs. \nHowever, the firm may continue after dissociation; it must buy out the dissociated one’s interest, minus \ndamages if the dissociation was wrongful. \nIf the firm is to be terminated, winding up entails finishing the business at hand, paying off creditors, and \nsplitting the remaining surplus or liabilities according the parties’ agreement or, absent any, according to the \nrelevant act (UPA or RUPA). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Under UPA, what is the effect on the partnership of a partner’s ceasing to be involved in the business? \n2. Can a person no longer a partner be held liable for partnership obligations after her withdrawal? Can such a \nperson incur liability to the partnership? \n3. What obligation does a partnership or its partners owe to a partner who wrongfully terminates the \npartnership agreement?",

                    "answer": "A court may judicially supervise the winding up of a partnership upon application by any partner with good cause, ensuring a fair settlement of partnership accounts. This measure affects partners significantly as it implies that the court will oversee the liquidation process, potentially impacting how debts and liabilities are settled among partners and creditors. Under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), the priority of liabilities is determined, with creditors taking precedence over partners, followed by partners' capital contributions, and finally, their share of profits. However, in the case of insolvency, a court may seize both partnership property and individual assets of the partners, which poses a substantial risk to the partnership form. This highlights the importance of clear agreements on liability and asset distribution to avoid conflicts and ensure fairness during the winding up process."

                    "answer": "Under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), the estate of a deceased partner is treated as if the partner were alive at the time of distribution. This means the deceased partner's estate is liable for the partnership's obligations and is also entitled to receive a share of the partnership's remaining assets, proportional to their interest in the partnership. Conversely, under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA), the situation is similar but with some nuances. When a partner dies, their estate is credited or liable as if the partner were still alive, but RUPA provides more detailed procedures for the distribution of partnership interests and the handling of liabilities. Both acts ensure that the deceased partner's estate participates in the partnership's winding up process, reflecting the ongoing nature of partnership obligations even after a partner's death."

The division thereof after adjustments for plaintiff’s \npositive equity or capital resulted in an award to plaintiff for his interest in the business of $53,779.46 \n[about $126,000 in 2011 dollars].… \nPlaintiff also sought exemplary [punitive] damages. Count II of the complaint alleged that defendant’s \nconduct constituted a breach of defendant’s fiduciary duty to his partner under §§ 19-22 of the Uniform \nPartnership Act, and Count III alleged conversion of partnership property. Each count contained \nallegations that defendant’s conduct was willful, wanton and in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights and \nthat such conduct had caused injury to plaintiff’s feelings, including humiliation, indignity and a sense of \nmoral outrage. The prayer for relief sought exemplary damages therefore. \n \nPlaintiff’s testimony on the point was brief. He said: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n527 \nThe effect of really the whole situation, and I think it was most apparent when I walked into the \nempty building, was extreme disappointment and really total outrage at the fact that something \nthat I had given the utmost of my talent and creativity, energy, and whatever time was necessary \nto build, was totally destroyed and there was just nothing of any value that was left.…My \nbusiness had been stolen and there wasn’t a thing that I could do about it. And to me, that was \nvery humiliating that one day I had something that I had worked 10 years on, and the next day I \nhad absolutely nothing of any value. \n \nAs noted above, the trial judge found that defendant had literally destroyed the partnership by knowingly \nand willfully converting partnership assets in violation of his fiduciary duty as a partner. He also found \nthat plaintiff had suffered a sense of outrage, indignity and humiliation and awarded him $10,000 \n[$23,000 in 2011 dollars] as exemplary damages. \n \nDefendant appeals from that award, asserting that plaintiff’s cause of action arises from a breach of the \npartnership contract and that exemplary damages may not be awarded for breach of that contract.… \n \nIf it were to be assumed that a partner’s breach of his fiduciary duty or appropriation of partnership \nequipment and business contract to his own use and profit are torts, it is clear that the duty breached \narises from the partnership contract. One acquires the property interest of a co-tenant in partnership only \nby the contractual creation of a partnership; one becomes a fiduciary in partnership only by the \ncontractual undertaking to become a partner. There is no tortious conduct here existing independent of \nthe breach of the partnership contract. \n \nNeither do we see anything in the Uniform Partnership Act to suggest that an aggrieved partner is entitled \nto any remedy other than to be made whole economically. The act defines identically the partnership \nfiduciary duty and the remedy for its breach, i.e., to account: \n \nSec. 21.

The \nappeals court, construing the same UPA as the court construed in Gilroy, said: \nUnder New York law, the nature of the conduct which justifies an award of punitive damages is \nconduct having a high degree of moral culpability, or, in other words, conduct which shows a \n“conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such \ndisregard.”…[S]ince the purpose of punitive damages is to both punish the wrongdoer and deter others \nfrom such wrongful behavior, as a matter of policy, courts have the discretion to award punitive \ndamages[.]…[The defendant] was participating in a clandestine plan to wrongfully expel some \npartners for the financial gain of other partners.

Voeller, the managing partner of the Pay-Ont Drive-In \nTheatre, signed a contract for the sale of a small parcel of land belonging to the partnership. That parcel, \nalthough adjacent to the theater, was not used in theater operations except insofar as the east 20 feet were \nnecessary for the operation of the theater’s driveway. The agreement for the sale of land stated that it was \nbetween Hodge and the Pay-Ont Drive-In Theatre, a partnership. Voeller signed the agreement for the \npartnership, and written changes as to the footage and price were initialed by Voeller. (The trial court \nfound that Hodge and Voeller had orally agreed that this 20 foot strip would be encumbered by an \neasement for ingress and egress to the partnership lands.) \n \nVoeller testified that he had told Hodge prior to signing that Hodge would have to present him with a plat \nplan which would have to be approved by the partners before the property could be sold. Hodge denied \nthat a plat plan had ever been mentioned to him, and he testified that Voeller did not tell him that the \napproval of the other partners was needed until after the contract was signed. Hodge also testified that he \noffered to pay Voeller the full purchase price when he signed the contract, but Voeller told him that that \nwas not necessary. \n \nThe trial court found that Voeller had actual and apparent authority to execute the contract on behalf of \nthe partnership, and that the contract should be specifically enforced.

But the partnership may recover the property (except from a bona fide purchaser from \nthe grantee) if it can show (A) that the conveying partner was not apparently carrying on \nbusiness in the usual way or (B) that he had in fact no authority and the grantee had knowledge \nof that fact. The burden of proof with respect to authority is thus on the partnership.” [Citation] \n \nThus this contract is enforceable if Voeller had the actual authority to sell the property, or, even if Voeller \ndid not have such authority, the contract is still enforceable if the sale was in the usual way of carrying on \nthe business and Hodge did not know that Voeller did not have this authority.",

Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy, \nversus the “moral hazard” of allowing them to emerge mostly unscathed from their own harmful or \nfoolish activities, thus externalizing resulting losses upon others. Some people feel that during the \nrun-up to the “Great Recession” of 2007–09, the economic system allowed too much risk taking. \nWhen the risky investments collapsed, though, instead of forcing the risk takers to suffer loss, the \ngovernment intervened—it “bailed them out,” as they say, putting the consequences of the failed \nrisks on the taxpayer. \n \nThe risk-averseness and inventiveness of businesspeople is seemingly unlimited, as is investors’ urge \nto make profits through others’ efforts with as little risk as possible.

Termination \n \n \nGoverning Law and Definition \nThe limited partnership is attractive because of its treatment of taxation and its imposition of limited \nliability on its limited partners. \nGoverning Law \nThe original source of limited partnership law is the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which was \ndrafted in 1916. A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted \nby the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and \nin 2001. \n \nThe 2001 act was \ndrafted for a world in which limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies can \nmeet many of the needs formerly met by limited partnerships. This Act therefore targets two \ntypes of enterprises that seem largely beyond the scope of LLPs and LLCs: (i) sophisticated, \nmanager-entrenched commercial deals whose participants commit for the long term, and (ii) \nestate planning arrangements (family limited partnerships). The Act accordingly assumes that, \nmore often than not, people utilizing it will want (1) strong centralized management, strongly \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n549 \nentrenched, and (2) passive investors with little control over or right to exit the entity. The Act’s \nrules, and particularly its default rules, have been designed to reflect these assumptions. [1] \n \nAll states except Louisiana adopted the 1976 or 1985 act—most opting for the 1985 version—and sixteen \nstates have adopted the 2001 version. The acts may be properly referred to with a hyphen: “ULPA-1985,” \nor “ULPA-2001”; the word revised has been dropped. Here, we mainly discuss ULPA-1985. The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) also applies to limited \npartnerships except where it is inconsistent with the limited partnership statutes. The ULPA-2001 is not \nso much related to UPA or RUPA as previous versions were. \n \nDefinition \nA limited partnership (LP) is defined as “a partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws \nof a State and having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.” [2] The form tends \nto be attractive in business situations that focus on a single or limited-term project, such as making a \nmovie or developing real estate; it is also widely used by private equity firms. \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nUnlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created in accordance with the state statute \nauthorizing it. There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation",

                    "answer": "The key governing laws for limited partnerships are derived from the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), which was initially drafted in 1916. A revised version, the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA), was adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform Laws in 1976 and further amended in 1985 and 2001. The 2001 act was specifically tailored for scenarios where limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies could not adequately address certain needs. It emphasizes strong centralized management and passive investors with limited control. Unlike a general partnership, a limited partnership requires the formation of two categories of partners: limited and general. Limited partners contribute capital to the business, while general partners manage the operations. The distinction lies in the liability structure, where limited partners enjoy limited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations, whereas general partners bear unlimited personal liability."

It is created by state \nauthority that, upon application, issues the “certificate of organization.” It is controlled either by managers or \nby members, it affords its members limited liability, and it is taxed like a partnership. But these happy results \nare obtained only if the firm lacks enough corporate attributes to escape being labeled as a corporation. To \navoid too much “corporateness,” the firm’s certificate usually limits its continuity of life and the free \ntransferability of interest. The ongoing game is to finesse these limits: to make them as nonconstraining as \npossible, to get right up to the line to preserve continuity, and to make the interest as freely transferable as \npossible. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Recognize other business forms: sub-S corporations, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability \nlimited partnerships. \n \n \nSub-S Corporation \nHistory \nThe sub-S corporation or the S corporation gets its name from the IRS Code, Chapter 1, Subchapter S. It \nwas authorized by Congress in 1958 to help small corporations and to stem the economic and cultural \ninfluence of the relatively few, but increasingly powerful, huge multinational corporations. According to \nthe website of an S corporation champion, “a half century later, S corporations are the most popular \ncorporate structure in America. The IRS estimates that there were 4.5 million S corporation owners in the \nUnited States in 2007—about twice the number of C [standard] corporations.” [1] \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nThe S corporation is a regular corporation created upon application to the appropriate secretary of state’s \noffice and operated according to its bylaws and shareholders’ agreements. There are, however, some limits \non how the business is set up, among them the following: \n \n• \nIt must be incorporated in the United States. \n• \nIt cannot have more than one hundred shareholders (a married couple counts as one \nshareholder). \n• \nThe only shareholders are individuals, estates, certain exempt organizations, or certain trusts. \n• \nOnly US citizens and resident aliens may be shareholders. \n• \nThe corporation has only one class of stock. \n• \nWith some exceptions, it cannot be a bank, thrift institution, or insurance company. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n565 \n• \nAll shareholders must consent to the S corporation election. \n• \nIt is capitalized as is a regular corporation. \n \nLiability \nThe owners of the S corporation have limited liability. \n \nTaxation \nTaxation is the crux of the matter. The S corporation pays no corporate income tax (unless it has a lot of \npassive income). The S corporation’s shareholders include on their personal income statements, and pay \ntax on, their share of the corporation’s separately stated items of income, deduction, and loss. That is, the \nS corporation avoids the dreaded double taxation of corporate income. \n \nTransferability of Ownership \nS corporations’ shares can be bought or sold via share purchase agreements, and all changes in the \nownership are reflected in the share ledger in the corporate minute book. \n \nLimited Liability Partnerships \nBackground \nIn 1991, Texas enacted the first limited liability partnership (LLP) statute, largely in response to the \nliability that had been imposed on partners in partnerships sued by government agencies in relation to \nmassive savings and loan failures in the 1980s.

                    "answer": "An LLC and a corporation differ significantly in terms of the transferability of ownership. In a corporation, shares are freely transferable unless restricted by the shareholders' agreement. However, in an LLC, the transferability of ownership is more restrictive, with the default provision not allowing for free transferability of interests. To overcome this restriction, LLC agreements often stipulate that majority consent is required for the transfer of all attributes, thereby satisfying the requirement of limited transferability. This approach allows LLCs to maintain flexibility while still adhering to the necessary restrictions to avoid being labeled as corporations. Furthermore, the LLC can define 'majority' based on the number of members or the value of their membership, or even limit consent to managing partners, depending on the specific circumstances and preferences of the LLC."

                    "answer": "LLCs and S corporations both aim to achieve a balance between corporate-like attributes and avoiding classification as corporations, especially concerning the transferability of ownership. LLCs typically address this issue by limiting the transferability of ownership through specific provisions in their operating agreements, such as requiring majority consent for transfers or defining 'majority' based on the number of members or the value of their membership. S corporations, on the other hand, achieve this balance by avoiding double taxation through pass-through taxation, where the corporation's income is reported on the individual shareholders' tax returns. Both entities carefully manage their structures to stay just short of the corporate threshold, ensuring they maintain the benefits of limited liability and pass-through taxation without fully adopting corporate formalities that could lead to unwanted regulatory scrutiny or classification as corporations."

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

Now, in the \nsection quoted in the previous paragraph, the general partner’s liability for partnership obligations is \nvaporized too. (Of course, the general partner is liable for its, his, or her own torts.) The preface to ULPA-\n2001 explains, “In a limited liability limited partnership (‘LLLP’), no partner—whether general or \nlimited—is liable on account of partner status for the limited partnership’s obligations. Both general and \nlimited partners benefit from a full, status-based liability shield that is equivalent to the shield enjoyed by \ncorporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in an LLP.” \n \nPresumably, most existing limited partnerships will switch over to LLLPs. The ULPA-2001 provides that \n“the Act makes LLLP status available through a simple statement in the certificate of limited partnership.” \n \nEthical Concerns \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n568 \nThere was a reason that partnership law imposed personal liability on the partners: people tend to be \nmore careful when they are personally liable for their own mistakes and bad judgment. Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears. [6] Whether the movement to allow almost anybody the right to a business organization that affords \nlimited liability will encourage entrepreneurship and business activity or whether it will usher in a new \nera of moral hazard—people being allowed to escape the consequences of their own irresponsibility—is \nyet to be seen. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBusinesspeople always prefer to reduce their risks. The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The principal disadvantage of the general partnership is that it imposes unlimited personal liability on the \npartners. What is the disadvantage of the corporate form? \n2. Why isn’t the limited partnership an entirely satisfactory solution to the liability problem of the \npartnership? \n3.

                    "answer": "A limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) offers comprehensive protection against the partnership's obligations to its partners, both general and limited, which is equivalent to the liability shield enjoyed by corporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in a limited liability partnership (LLP). This means that neither general nor limited partners are personally liable for the partnership's debts or other obligations solely because of their status as a partner. This level of protection aligns closely with the limited liability afforded by corporations and LLCs, where owners are generally not held personally responsible for the company's liabilities. The primary distinction lies in the operational flexibility and specific governance structures permitted under an LLLP, which can provide tailored solutions for different business needs. Unlike corporations, which face strict regulatory requirements and double taxation, and LLCs, which have more flexible management structures but may require state-specific compliance, LLLPs combine the best aspects of both forms, offering simplified formation and operation along with limited liability."

Under ULPA-2001, most existing limited partnerships would likely opt to convert to LLLPs to take advantage of the enhanced liability protection. The process for converting to an LLLP is relatively straightforward, as it involves a simple statement in the certificate of limited partnership. This change can streamline operations and reduce the risks associated with unlimited personal liability, potentially encouraging greater participation from investors and entrepreneurs who are concerned about personal financial exposure. However, the conversion process must be carefully managed to ensure compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, and it is advisable for existing limited partnerships to consult with legal counsel to navigate the transition effectively."

Become acquainted with how states formed their corporate laws. \n \n \nA Fixture of Every Major Legal System \nLike partnership, the corporation is an ancient concept, recognized in the Code of Hammurabi, and to \nsome degree a fixture in every other major legal system since then. The first corporations were not \nbusiness enterprises; instead, they were associations for religious and governmental ends in which \nperpetual existence was a practical requirement. Thus until relatively late in legal history, kings, popes, \nand jurists assumed that corporations could be created only by political or ecclesiastical authority and that \ncorporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711).

                    "answer": "The Limited Liability Company (LLC) form offers an advantage over the Subchapter S corporation in terms of tax treatment due to the fact that, unlike Subchapter S corporations, LLCs can choose to be treated as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes, thereby avoiding the double taxation issue that affects Subchapter S corporations. This means that the profits and losses of an LLC pass through to the members' personal tax returns without being subject to corporate-level taxation. On the other hand, Subchapter S corporations require their profits to be taxed at the corporate level before being passed down to shareholders, leading to a potential second layer of taxation. Regarding operational formalities, LLCs generally require fewer formalities compared to Subchapter S corporations. LLCs do not have the same stringent requirements for holding annual meetings, maintaining minutes, or other formal administrative procedures, making the LLC a more flexible and less bureaucratic option for small businesses and entrepreneurs."

            "chunk": "corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws.

                    "answer": "During the 18th and 19th centuries, England and the United States had different approaches to the formation and regulation of corporations. In England, corporations were initially seen as a privilege granted by the sovereign, and this was formalized through the concession theory where incorporation required a royal grant or charter. The most significant charters were given to large foreign trading companies, such as the British East India Company, Hudson's Bay Company, and South Sea Company. These companies were granted extensive powers and were allowed to operate as joint-stock companies, providing limited liability to shareholders. However, this system was disrupted by the Bubble Act of 1720, which aimed to restrict the formation of unchartered joint-stock companies, leading to a financial crisis and severely retarding corporate development. On the other hand, the United States was largely unaffected by the Bubble Act, and incorporation was granted by special acts of state legislatures even well into the 19th century. The number of business corporations increased significantly during this period, and the theory that incorporation should be accomplished through special legislation began to give way. By the late 19th century, most states allowed incorporation by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court played a significant role in developing corporate law, notably in Gibbons v. Ogden, which affirmed federal power over interstate commerce, and in Paul v. Virginia, which allowed foreign corporations to operate in states if they were engaged in interstate business."

Define the two types of business corporations. \n \n \n \nNonprofit Corporations \nOne of the four major classifications of corporations is the nonprofit corporation (also called not-for-\nprofit corporation). It is defined in the American Bar Association’s Model Non-Profit Corporation Act as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n599 \n“a corporation no part of the income of which is distributable to its members, directors or officers.” \nNonprofit corporations may be formed under this law for charitable, educational, civil, religious, social, \nand cultural purposes, among others. \n \nPublic Corporations \nThe true public corporation is a governmental entity. It is often called a municipal corporation, to \ndistinguish it from the publicly held corporation, which is sometimes also referred to as a “public” \ncorporation, although it is in fact private (i.e., it is not governmental). Major cities and counties, and many \ntowns, villages, and special governmental units, such as sewer, transportation, and public utility \nauthorities, are incorporated. These corporations are not organized for profit, do not have shareholders, \nand operate under different statutes than do business corporations. \n \nProfessional Corporations \nUntil the 1960s, lawyers, doctors, accountants, and other professionals could not practice their \nprofessions in corporate form. This inability, based on a fear of professionals’ being subject to the \ndirection of the corporate owners, was financially disadvantageous. Under the federal income tax laws \nthen in effect, corporations could establish far better pension plans than could the self-employed. During \nthe 1960s, the states began to let professionals incorporate, but the IRS balked, denying them many tax \nbenefits. In 1969, the IRS finally conceded that it would tax a professional corporation just as it would \nany other corporation, so that professionals could, from that time on, place a much higher proportion of \ntax-deductible income into a tax-deferred pension.

There are two broad types of \nbusiness corporations: publicly held (or public) and closely held (or close or private) corporations. Again, \nboth types are private in the sense that they are not governmental. \n \nThe publicly held corporation is one in which stock is widely held or available for wide public distribution \nthrough such means as trading on a national or regional stock exchange. Its managers, if they are also \nowners of stock, usually constitute a small percentage of the total number of shareholders and hold a \nsmall amount of stock relative to the total shares outstanding. Few, if any, shareholders of public \ncorporations know their fellow shareholders. \n \nBy contrast, the shareholders of the closely held corporation are fewer in number. Shares in a closely held \ncorporation could be held by one person, and usually by no more than thirty. Shareholders of the closely \nheld corporation often share family ties or have some other association that permits each to know the \nothers. \n \nThough most closely held corporations are small, no economic or legal reason prevents them from being \nlarge. Some are huge, having annual sales of several billion dollars each. Roughly 90 percent of US \ncorporations are closely held. \n \nThe giant publicly held companies with more than $1 billion in assets and sales, with initials such as IBM \nand GE, constitute an exclusive group. Publicly held corporations outside this elite class fall into two \nbroad (nonlegal) categories: those that are quoted on stock exchanges and those whose stock is too widely \ndispersed to be called closely held but is not traded on exchanges. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n601 \nThere are four major classifications of corporations: (1) nonprofit, (2) municipal, (3) professional, and (4) \nbusiness.

The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted.

Although compliance with these requirements is largely a matter of filling in the blanks, two \npoints deserve mention. \n \nFirst, the choice of a name is often critical to the business. Under RMBCA, Section 4.01, the name must \ninclude one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, incorporated, or limited \n(Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The name is not allowed to deceive the public about the corporation’s purposes, \nnor may it be the same as that of any other company incorporated or authorized to do business in the \nstate. \n \nThese legal requirements are obvious; the business requirements are much harder. If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes. Section 3.01 of the RMBCA goes one step further in providing that a corporation \nautomatically “has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business” unless the articles specify a more \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n607 \nlimited purpose. Once completed, the articles of incorporation are delivered to the secretary of state for \nfiling. The existence of a corporation begins once the articles have been filed. \n \nOrganizational Meeting of Directors \nThe first order of business, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, is a meeting of the board of \ndirectors named in the articles of incorporation. They must adopt bylaws, elect officers, and transact any \nother business that may come before the meeting (RMBCA, Section 2.05). Other business would include \naccepting (ratifying) promoters’ contracts, calling for the payment of stock subscriptions, and adopting \nbank resolution forms, giving authority to various officers to sign checks drawn on the corporation. \nSection 10.20 of the RMBCA vests in the directors the power to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws adopted \nat the initial meeting, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. The articles of incorporation may \nreserve the power to modify or repeal exclusively to the shareholders. The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency.

Distinguish between a de jure and a de facto corporation. \n2. Define the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. \n \n \nDe Jure and De Facto Corporations \nIf promoters meet the requirements of corporate formation, a de jure corporation, considered a legal \nentity, is formed. Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

This occurs under equitable principles where one party has acted in a manner that suggests the existence of a corporation, and denying its existence would be inequitable. For instance, in the case of BCT Bookstore, Inc., Carol would be estopped from denying the corporation's existence because she had turned over a deed to the corporation, indicating her acceptance of its status as a corporation."

Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility. To sharpen the definition for purposes of CERCLA’s concern with \nenvironmental contamination, an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related \nto the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental \nregulations. \n \n(b) The Sixth Circuit correctly rejected the direct liability analysis of the District Court, which mistakenly \nfocused on the relationship between parent and subsidiary, and premised liability on little more than \nCPC’s ownership of Ott II and its majority control over Ott II’s board of directors. Because direct liability \nfor the parent’s operation of the facility must be kept distinct from derivative liability for the subsidiary’s \noperation of the facility, the analysis should instead have focused on the relationship between CPC and \nthe facility itself, i.e., on whether CPC “operated” the facility, as evidenced by its direct participation in the \nfacility’s activities. That error was compounded by the District Court’s erroneous assumption that actions \nof the joint officers and directors were necessarily attributable to CPC, rather than Ott II, contrary to time-\nhonored common-law principles. The District Court’s focus on the relationship between parent and \nsubsidiary (rather than parent and facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actions of dual \nofficers and directors to CPC, erroneously, even if unintentionally, treated CERCLA as though it displaced \nor fundamentally altered common-law standards of limited liability. The District Court’s analysis created \nwhat is in essence a relaxed, CERCLA-specific rule of derivative liability that would banish traditional \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n617 \nstandards and expectations from the law of CERCLA liability. Such a rule does not arise from \ncongressional silence, and CERCLA’s silence is dispositive. \n \n(c) Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit erred in limiting direct liability under CERCLA to a parent’s sole or joint \nventure operation, so as to eliminate any possible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the facts of \nthis case. The ordinary meaning of the word “operate” in the organizational sense is not limited to those \ntwo parental actions, but extends also to situations in which, e.g., joint officers or directors conduct the \naffairs of the facility on behalf of the parent, or agents of the parent with no position in the subsidiary \nmanage or direct activities at the subsidiary’s facility. Norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by any \nCERCLA provision) are crucial reference points, both for determining whether a dual officer or director \nhas served the parent in conducting operations at the facility, and for distinguishing a parental officer’s \noversight of a subsidiary from his control over the operation of the subsidiary’s facility. There is, in fact, \nsome evidence that an agent of CPC alone engaged in activities at Ott II’s plant that were eccentric under \naccepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary’s facility: The District Court’s opinion speaks of such \nan agent who played a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the plant’s \noperation. The findings in this regard are enough to raise an issue of CPC’s operation of the facility, \nthough this Court draws no ultimate conclusion, leaving the issue for the lower courts to reevaluate and \nresolve in the first instance. \n \n113 F.3d 572, vacated and remanded. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

The Sixth Circuit disagreed with this approach, emphasizing that direct liability must be distinguished from derivative liability. Instead, the analysis should focus on whether CPC operated the facility, as evidenced by its direct participation in the facility's activities. The court also noted that norms of corporate behavior are crucial in determining whether an officer or director has served the parent in conducting operations at the facility, and that there was some evidence suggesting CPC's agent had engaged in activities at Ott II's plant that were outside accepted norms of parental oversight."

That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed, \nthe entire agreement is silent as to the effect the formation of the projected corporation would have upon \nthe personal liability of Jenofsky and Graziano. Because the agreement fails to provide expressly for the \nrelease of personal liability, it is, therefore, subject to more than one possible construction. \n \nIn Consolidated Tile and Slate Co. v. Fox, 410 Pa. 336,339,189 A.2d 228, 229 (1963), we stated that where \nan agreement is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, “it must be construed most \nstrongly against those who drew it.”…Instantly, the chancellor determined that the intent of the parties to \nthe agreement was to hold Jenofsky personally responsible until such time as a corporate entity was \nformed and until such time as that corporate entity adopted the agreement. We believe this construction \nrepresents the only rational and prudent interpretation of the parties’ intent. \n \nAs found by the court below, this agreement was entered into on the financial strength of Jenofsky and \nGraziano, alone as individuals. Therefore, it would have been illogical for RKO to have consented to the \nrelease of their personal liability upon the mere formation of a resultant corporation prior to closing. For \nit is a well-settled rule that a contract made by a promoter, even though made for and in the name of a \nproposed corporation, in the absence of a subsequent adoption (either expressly or impliedly) by the \ncorporation, will not be binding upon the corporation. If, as Jenofsky contends, the intent was to release \npersonal responsibility upon the mere incorporation prior to closing, the effect of the agreement would \nhave been to create the possibility that RKO, in the event of non-performance, would be able to hold no \nparty accountable: there being no guarantee that the resultant corporation would ratify the agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n621 \nWithout express language in the agreement indicating that such was the intention of the parties, we may \nnot attribute this intention to them. \n \nTherefore, we hold that the intent of the parties in entering into this agreement was to have Jenofsky and \nGraziano personally liable until such time as the intended corporation was formed and ratified the \nagreement. [And there is no evidence that Kent Enterprises ratified the agreement. The decree is \naffirmed.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Cranson, Jr., was a partner in the business conducted by the Bureau and as such was \npersonally liable for its debts, the International Business Machines Corporation brought this action \nagainst Cranson for the balance due on electric typewriters purchased by the Bureau.

In the context of promoters and proposed corporations, this ensures that the corporation is not bound to a contract that was not intended to be binding until it has ratified it through formal adoption, thereby protecting the corporation from potential liabilities without its explicit consent."

However, once the corporation formally accepts the contract, the liability shifts to the corporation itself. The corporation then becomes responsible for fulfilling the terms of the contract, and Laverne's personal liability is eliminated as long as the corporation has the capacity to fulfill its obligations.

Some shares may give holders preemptive rights to purchase additional shares. This right is often \ninvoked in two instances. First, if a corporation is going to issue more shares, a shareholder may invoke \nthis right so that his or her total percentage ownership is not diluted. Second, the right to purchase \nadditional shares can be invoked to prevent a hostile takeover (a poison pill, discussed in Section 15.3.3 \n\"Preferred Stock\"). \n \nCorporations may issue different classes of shares (including both common and preferred stock). This \npermits a corporation to provide different rights to shareholders. For example, one class of common stock \nmay give holders more votes than another class of common stock. Stock is a riskier investment for its \npurchasers compared with bonds and preferred stock. In exchange for this increased risk and junior \ntreatment, common stockholders have the rights noted here. \n \nTreasury Shares \nTreasury shares are those that were originally issued and then reacquired by the company (such as in a \nbuyback, discussed next) or, alternatively, never sold to the public in the first place and simply retained by \nthe corporation. Thus treasury shares are shares held or owned by the corporation. They are considered to \nbe issued shares but not outstanding shares. \n \n \nBuyback \nCorporations often reacquire their shares, for a variety of reasons, in a process sometimes called \na buyback. If the stock price has dropped so far that the shares are worth considerably less than book \nvalue, the corporation might wish to buy its shares to prevent another company from taking it over. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n641 \ncompany might decide that investing in itself is a better strategic decision than making other potential \nexpenditures or investments. And although it is essentially an accounting trick, buybacks improve a \ncompany’s per-share earnings because profits need to be divided into fewer outstanding shares. \n \nBuybacks can also be used to go private. Private equity may play a role in going-private transactions, as \ndiscussed in Section 15.1.5 \"Other Forms of Finance\". The corporation may not have sufficient equity to \nbuy out all its public shareholders and thus will partner with private equity to finance the stock buyback to \ngo private. For example, in early 2011, Playboy Enterprises, Inc., publisher of Playboy magazine, went \nprivate. Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy, teamed up with private equity firm Rizvi Traverse \nManagement to buy back the public shares. Hefner said that the transaction “will give us the resources \nand flexibility to return Playboy to its unique position and to further expand our business around the \nworld.” [1] \n \nCorporations may go private to consolidate control, because of a belief that the shares are undervalued, to \nincrease flexibility, or because of a tender offer or hostile takeover. Alternatively, an outside investor may \nthink that a corporation is not being managed properly and may use a tender offer to buy all the public \nshares. \n \nStocks and Bonds and Bears, Oh My! \nSuppose that BCT Bookstore, Inc. has become a large, well-established corporation after a round of \nprivate equity and bank loans (since repaid) but needs to raise capital. What is the best method? There is \nno one right answer. Much of the decision will depend on the financial and accounting standing of the \ncorporation: if BCT already has a lot of debt, it might be better to issue stock rather than bring on more \ndebt. Alternatively, BCT could wish to remain a privately held corporation, and thus a stock sale would \nnot be considered, as it would dilute the ownership. The economy in general could impact the decision: a \nbear market could push BCT more toward using debt, while a bull market could push BCT more toward an \ninitial public offering (discussed in Section 15.4.1 \"Sale of stock\") or stock sale. Interest rates could be low, \nincreasing the bang-for-the-buck factor of debt. Additionally, public stock sales can be risky for the \ncorporation: the corporation could undervalue its stock in the initial sale, selling the stock for less than \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n642 \nwhat the marketplace thinks it is worth, missing out on additional funds because of this undervaluation.",

                    "answer": "When a corporation repurchases its own shares through a buyback, it impacts its financial statements and overall strategy in several ways. Firstly, it can be seen as a strategic move to improve earnings per share (EPS), as profits are now spread over fewer shares, making the company appear more profitable on a per-share basis. This can be beneficial for maintaining or increasing stock prices. Secondly, buybacks can serve as a way to return excess cash to shareholders, providing them with liquidity and potentially increasing their returns. Thirdly, a buyback can be a tool to signal management confidence in the company's future prospects, as they are willing to invest in the company by buying back shares. Lastly, buybacks can be used to go private, allowing a corporation to consolidate control, believe that shares are undervalued, or increase flexibility, especially when paired with private equity financing."

Holders of common stock have a different set of rights, namely, the right to vote on \nimportant corporate decisions such as the election of directors. A corporation may purchase some of its \nshares from its shareholders in a process called a buyback. Stock in the hands of the corporation is called \ntreasury stock.

Understand what an initial public offering is and under what circumstances one is usually done. \n2. Examine the various requirements of selling stock. \n3. Discuss what adequate and valid consideration is in exchange for stock. \n \n \nSale of stock \nRather than using debt to finance operations, a corporation may instead sell stock. This is most often \naccomplished through an initial public offering (IPO), or the first time a corporation offers stock for \nsale to the public. The sale of securities, such as stock, is governed by the Securities Act of 1933. In \nparticular, Section 5 of the 1933 act governs the specifics of the sale of securities. To return to BCT \nBookstore, Inc., suppose the company wishes to sell stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for \nthe first time. That would be an IPO. The company would partner with securities lawyers and investment \nbanks to accomplish the sale. The banks underwrite the sale of the securities: in exchange for a fee, the \nbank will buy the shares from BCT and then sell them. The company and its team prepare a registration \nstatement, which contains required information about the IPO and is submitted to the Securities and \nExchange Commission (SEC). The SEC reviews the registration statement and makes the decision \nwhether to permit or prohibit BCT’s IPO. Once the SEC approves the IPO, BCT’s investment banks \npurchase the shares in the primary market and then resell them to investors on the secondary market on \nthe NYSE. (For a further discussion of these two markets, see Chapter 17 \"Securities Regulation\"). Stock \nsales are not limited to an IPO—publicly traded corporations may sell stock several times after going \npublic. The requirements of the 1933 act remain but are loosened for well-known corporations (well-\nknown seasoned issuers). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n644 \nAn IPO or stock sale has several advantages. A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example,",

                    "answer": "A corporation might consider several factors when deciding whether to finance through debt or equity. The economy plays a significant role; during a bear market, a corporation might opt for debt financing due to its potentially lower cost compared to equity. Conversely, a bull market might encourage an initial public offering (IPO) or stock sale, which can enhance the company's visibility and attract more investors. Interest rates also impact the decision, as lower rates make debt more attractive due to the tax benefits of interest deductions. Additionally, the risk of undervaluing stock in an IPO poses a concern for corporations, as selling at a price below market value can result in missed opportunities for additional funding. Furthermore, the tax treatment of interest payments on debt versus dividends paid on equity is another critical consideration."

                    "answer": "Preferred stock and common stock represent different classes of ownership in a corporation, each with distinct rights and characteristics. Preferred stockholders typically enjoy priority over common stockholders in terms of receiving dividends and in the event of liquidation. They are entitled to a fixed dividend rate and have a claim on assets before common stockholders. On the other hand, common stockholders have voting rights and participate in corporate governance, such as electing board members and approving significant corporate actions. These differences significantly impact a corporation's capital structure, as preferred stock often acts as a hybrid security, blending aspects of debt and equity. By issuing preferred stock, a corporation can maintain control while still attracting capital, whereas common stock provides the potential for growth and increased investor base but requires careful management of shareholder rights and corporate governance."

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend \nNext to cash, the most frequent type of dividend is stock itself. Normally, the corporation declares a small \npercentage dividend (between 1 and 10 percent), so that a holder of one hundred shares would receive \nfour new shares on a 4 percent dividend share. Although each shareholder winds up with more stock, he \nrealizes no personal net gain at that moment, as he would with a cash dividend, because each stockholder \nhas the same relative proportion of shares and has not sold or otherwise transferred the shares or \ndividend. The total outstanding stock represents no greater amount of assets than before. The corporation \nmay issue share dividends either from treasury stock or from authorized but unissued shares. \n \nProperty Dividend \nRarely, corporations pay dividends in property rather than in cash. Armand Hammer, the legendary \nfinancier and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, recounts how during World War II he founded a \nliquor business by buying shares of the American Distilling Company. American Distilling was giving out \none barrel of whiskey per share as a dividend. Whiskey was in short supply during the war, so Hammer \nbought five thousand shares and took five thousand barrels of whiskey as a dividend. \n \nStock Split \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n649 \nA stock dividend should be distinguished from a stock split. In a stock split, one share is divided into \nmore shares—for example, a two-for-one split means that for every one share the stockholder owned \nbefore the split, he now has two shares. In a reverse stock split, shares are absorbed into one. In a one-for-\ntwo reverse split, the stockholder will get one share in place of the two he held before the split. \n \nThe stock split has no effect on the assets of the company, nor is the interest of any shareholder diluted. \nNo transfer from surplus into stated capital is necessary. The only necessary accounting change is the \nadjustment of par value and stated value. Because par value is being changed, many states require not \nonly the board of directors but also the shareholders to approve a stock split. \n \nWhy split? The chief reason is to reduce the current market price of the stock in order to make it \naffordable to a much wider class of investors. For example, in 1978, IBM, whose stock was then selling for \naround $284, split four for one, reducing the price to about $70 a share. That was the lowest IBM’s stock \nhad been since 1932. Stock need not sell at stratospheric prices to be split, however; for example, \nAmerican Telnet Corporation, whose stock had been selling at $0.4375 a share, declared a five-for-one \nsplit in 1980. Apparently the company felt that the stock would be more affordable at $0.0875 a share. At \nthe opposite end of the spectrum are Class A shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which \nroutinely trade for more than $100,000 a share. Buffett has rebuffed efforts to split the Class A shares, but \nin 2010, shareholders approved a fifty-for-one split of Class B shares. [1] \n \nLegal Limitations on Dividends \nThe law imposes certain limitations on cash or property dividends a corporation may disburse. Dividends \nmay not be paid if (1) the business is insolvent (i.e., unable to pay its debts as they become due), (2) \npaying dividends would make it insolvent, or (3) payment would violate a restriction in the articles of \nincorporation. Most states also restrict the funds available for distribution to those available in earned \nsurplus. Under this rule, a corporation that ran a deficit in the current year could still declare a dividend \nas long as the total earned surplus offset the deficit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n650 \nA few states—significantly, Delaware is one of them—permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current \nearnings and those of the immediately preceding year, both years taken as a single period, even if the \nbalance sheet shows a negative earned surplus. Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution.

Firstly, dividends cannot be paid if the business is insolvent, meaning it is unable to pay its debts as they come due. Secondly, paying dividends would have to ensure the corporation does not become insolvent. Thirdly, payment of dividends cannot violate any restrictions stipulated in the articles of incorporation. Additionally, most states limit the funds available for distribution to those that are available in the earned surplus. This means that even if a corporation runs a deficit in the current year, it can still declare a dividend as long as the total earned surplus covers the deficit. Notably, some states like Delaware allow dividends to be paid from the net of current earnings and the immediately preceding year's earnings, even if the balance sheet shows a negative earned surplus, these dividends are referred to as nimble dividends."

                    "answer": "A stock split and a stock dividend serve different purposes and have distinct implications for shareholders and the corporation. In a stock split, one share is divided into multiple shares, typically increasing the number of shares outstanding while decreasing the price per share. This action does not affect the company's assets or the ownership percentage of existing shareholders. The primary reason for a stock split is to make the stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, often by lowering its price. For instance, IBM split its stock four for one in 1978, reducing the price from around $284 to about $70, making it more affordable. Conversely, a stock dividend involves issuing additional shares to existing shareholders without changing the overall market price of the stock. Instead, it increases the number of shares held by each shareholder, potentially diluting their ownership percentage slightly. Importantly, a stock dividend does not involve an immediate financial benefit to the shareholder, as the value of the shares remains unchanged, and no cash is received. The main implication of a stock split is that it can make the stock more attractive to retail investors, while a stock dividend can lead to a slight increase in the number of shares held by each investor, without altering the company's asset base or the shareholder's overall investment value."

[2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

This is different from regular dividends, which typically must be paid out of the current year's earnings. Regular dividends cannot be paid if the company has a deficit, whereas nimble dividends allow for such payouts by considering a rolling two-year period. This flexibility is particularly useful during periods when a company's current earnings might be insufficient to cover a dividend, but its overall financial health over the past two years remains strong enough to support the payout."

Know the modern changes to corporate finance terminology and specific requirements imposed by states. \n2. Compare the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to corporate finance with the applicability of the \n1933 and 1934 federal securities acts. \n \n \nChanges in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n653 \nPerhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \n(RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation. [1] \n \nTherefore, although the modern trend is to move away from par value as well as some other previously \ndiscussed terms—and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts—they still, in large measure, \npersist. \n \nIntroduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n654 \nPartial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of \ntransfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the",

Such stock was illegally issued and \nvoid. \n \nGriffitts was issued 10,000 shares partly in consideration for legal services to the Corporation and partly \nin exchange for the 5 acres of land. The stock was valued at $1 per share and the land had an agreed value \nof $4000. The trial court found (upon ample evidence) that the 4000 shares of stock issued to Griffitts \nwas in consideration of his promise to convey the land to the Corporation; that Griffitts never conveyed \nthe land; and the issuance of the stock was illegal and void. \nThe judgment of the board of directors “as to the value of consideration received for shares” is conclusive, \nbut such does not authorize the board to issue shares contrary to the Constitution, for services to be \nperformed in the future (as in the case of Hurt), or for property not received (as in the case of Griffitts). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n658 \n \nThe judgment is correct.

Furthermore, the Texas Constitution, specifically Article 12, Section 6, mandates that corporations cannot issue stock except for money paid, labor done, or property actually received.

This situation violated Article 2.16 of the Business Corporation Act, which stipulates that the board of directors cannot issue shares for property not received. The court emphasized that while the judgment of the board of directors regarding the value of the consideration received for shares is generally conclusive, it does not allow for issuing shares in contravention of the constitutional requirements. Therefore, the issuance of the 4000 shares was found to be invalid and void because the land, which was supposed to be the consideration, was not actually received by the corporation."

However, this approach could also make it seem like the company is overvaluing its stock, potentially affecting investor perception. On the other hand, setting the par value equal to the book value, or the equivalent of assets divided by the number of shares, ensures that the stock is valued closer to its actual worth, providing a more conservative approach. This can help maintain investor trust and prevent the appearance of inflated stock value. Nonetheless, the choice between these two approaches depends on the company's financial health, market conditions, and long-term strategic goals."

Additionally, an IPO can enhance the company's reputation and visibility, making it easier to attract future investors and talent. However, there are also several drawbacks. The process of going public is lengthy, costly, and complex, requiring significant preparation and compliance with regulatory requirements. Moreover, once the company goes public, it becomes subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, analysts, and the media, which can affect its privacy and operational autonomy. Furthermore, the company will have to adhere to strict reporting and disclosure obligations, which can be burdensome. Lastly, the company's stock price may be volatile and subject to market fluctuations, which can lead to uncertainty for both the company and its investors."

(The candidates from the \ntwo slates are not matched against each other on a one-to-one basis; instead, the five candidates with the \nhighest number of votes are elected.) Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors. Ordinarily, a director \nmay be removed by a majority vote of the shareholders. Cumulative voting will not aid a given single \ndirector whose ouster is being sought because the majority obviously can win on a straight vote. So \nSection 8.08 provides, “If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of \nvotes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal.” \n \nVoting Arrangements to Concentrate Power \nShareholders use three types of arrangements to concentrate their power: proxies, voting agreements, and \nvoting trusts. \n \nProxies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n676 \nA proxy is the representative of the shareholder. A proxy may be a person who stands in for the \nshareholder or may be a written instrument by which the shareholder casts her votes before the \nshareholder meeting. Modern proxy voting allows shareholders to vote electronically through the \nInternet, such as at http://www.proxyvoting.com. Proxies are usually solicited by and given to \nmanagement, either to vote for proposals or people named in the proxy or to vote however the proxy \nholder wishes. Through the proxy device, management of large companies can maintain control over the \nelection of directors. Proxies must be signed by the shareholder and are valid for eleven months from the \ntime they are received by the corporation unless the proxy explicitly states otherwise. Management may \nuse reasonable corporate funds to solicit proxies if corporate policy issues are involved, but \nmisrepresentations in the solicitation can lead a court to nullify the proxies and to deny reimbursement \nfor the solicitation cost. Only the last proxy given by a particular shareholder can be counted. \n \nProxy solicitations are regulated by the SEC. For instance, SEC rules require companies subject to the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 to file proxy materials with the SEC at least ten days before proxies are \nmailed to shareholders. Proxy statements must disclose all material facts, and companies must use a \nproxy form on which shareholders can indicate whether they approve or disapprove of the proposals. \n \nDissident groups opposed to management’s position are entitled to solicit their own proxies at their own \nexpense. The company must either furnish the dissidents with a list of all shareholders and addresses or \nmail the proxies at corporate expense. Since management usually prefers to keep the shareholder list \nprivate, dissidents can frequently count on the corporation to foot the mailing bill. \n \nVoting Agreements \nUnless they intend to commit fraud on a minority of stockholders, shareholders may agree in advance to \nvote in specific ways. Such a voting agreement, often called a shareholder agreement, is generally legal. \nShareholders may agree in advance, for example, to vote for specific directors; they can even agree to vote \nfor the dissolution of the corporation in the event that a predetermined contingency occurs. A voting \nagreement is easier to enter into than a voting trust (discussed next) and can be less expensive, since a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n677 \ntrustee is not paid to administer a voting agreement. A voting agreement also permits shareholders to \nretain their shares rather than turning the shares over to a trust, as would be required in a voting trust. \n \nVoting Trusts \nTo ensure that shareholder agreements will be honored, shareholders in most states can create \na voting trust. By this device, voting shares are given to voting trustees, who are empowered to vote the \nshares in accordance with the objectives set out in the trust agreement. Section 7.30 of the RMBCA limits \nthe duration of voting trusts to ten years. The voting trust is normally irrevocable, and the shareholders’ \nstock certificates are physically transferred to the voting trustees for the duration of the trust. The voting \ntrust agreement must be on file at the corporation, open for inspection by any shareholder. \n \nInspection of Books and Records \nShareholders are legally entitled to inspect the records of the corporation in which they hold shares. These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting",

These \nrecords include the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and corporate resolutions. As a general rule, \nshareholders who want certain records (such as minutes of a board of directors’ meeting or accounting \nrecords) must also have a “proper purpose,” such as to determine the propriety of the company’s dividend \npolicy or to ascertain the company’s true financial worth. Improper purposes include uncovering trade \nsecrets for sale to a competitor or compiling mailing lists for personal business purposes. A shareholder’s \nmotivation is an important factor in determining whether the purpose is proper, as the courts attempt to \nbalance the rights of both the shareholders and the corporation. For example, a Minnesota court applied \nDelaware law in finding that a shareholder’s request to view the corporation’s shareholder ledger to \nidentify shareholders and communicate with them about the corporation’s involvement in the Vietnam \nWar was improper. A desire to communicate with the other corporate shareholders was found to be \ninsufficient to compel inspection. [2] Contrast that finding with a Delaware court’s finding that a \nshareholder had a proper purpose in requesting a corporation’s shareholder list in order to communicate \nwith them about the economic risks of the firm’s involvement in Angola. [3] \nPreemptive Rights \nAssume that BCT Bookstore has outstanding 5,000 shares with par value of ten dollars and that Carol \nowns 1,000. At the annual meeting, the shareholders decide to issue an additional 1,000 shares at par and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n678 \nto sell them to Alice. Carol vehemently objects because her percentage of ownership will decline. She goes \nto court seeking an injunction against the sale or an order permitting her to purchase 200 of the shares \n(she currently has 20 percent of the total). How should the court rule? \n \nThe answer depends on the statutory provision dealing with preemptive rights—that is, the right of a \nshareholder to be protected from dilution of her percentage of ownership. In some states, shareholders \nhave no preemptive rights unless expressly declared in the articles of incorporation, while other states \ngive shareholders preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation deny it. Preemptive rights were \nonce strongly favored, but they are increasingly disappearing, especially in large publicly held companies \nwhere ownership is already highly diluted. \n \nDerivative Actions \nSuppose Carol discovers that Ted has been receiving kickbacks from publishers and has been splitting the \nproceeds with Bob. When at a directors’ meeting, Carol demands that the corporation file suit to recover \nthe sums they pocketed, but Bob and Ted outvote her. Carol has another remedy. She can file a \nderivative action against them. A derivative lawsuit is one brought on behalf of the corporation by a \nshareholder when the directors refuse to act. Although the corporation is named as a defendant in the \nsuit, the corporation itself is the so-called real party in interest—the party entitled to recover if the \nplaintiff wins. \n \nWhile derivative actions are subject to abuse by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking settlements that pay their \nfees, safeguards have been built into the law. At least ninety days before starting a derivative action, for \ninstance, shareholders must demand in writing that the corporation take action. Shareholders may not \ncommence derivative actions unless they were shareholders at the time of the wrongful act. Derivative \nactions may be dismissed if disinterested directors decide that the proceeding is not in the best interests \nof the corporation. (A disinterested director is a director who has no interest in the disputed \ntransaction.)

However, if the motive involves improper objectives like selling trade secrets or for personal gain, the inspection may be denied.

In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the \ncorporation. The rule encompasses the chance of acquiring another corporation, purchasing property, and \nlicensing or marketing patents or products. This duty of disclosure was placed into legal lexicon by Judge \nCardozo in 1928 when he stated that business partners owe more than a general sense of honor among \none another; rather, they owe “the punctilio of honor most sensitive.” [3] Thus when a corporate \nopportunity arises, business partners must disclose the opportunity, and a failure to disclose is \ndishonest—a breach of the duty of loyalty. \n \nWhether a particular opportunity is a corporate opportunity can be a delicate question. For example, BCT \nowns a golf course and a country club. A parcel of land adjacent to their course comes on the market for \nsale, but BCT takes no action. Two BCT officers purchase the land personally, later informing the BCT \nboard about the purchase and receiving board ratification of their purchase. Then BCT decides to \nliquidate and enters into an agreement with the two officers to sell both parcels of land. A BCT \nshareholder brings a derivative suit against the officers, alleging that purchasing the adjacent land stole a \ncorporate opportunity. The shareholder would be successful in his suit. In considering Farber v. Servan \nLand Co., Inc., [4] a case just like the one described, the Farber court laid out four factors in considering \nwhether a corporate opportunity has been usurped: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n687 \n1. Whether there is an actual corporate opportunity that the firm is considering \n2. Whether the corporation’s shareholders declined to follow through on the opportunity \n3. Whether the board or its shareholders ratified the purchase and, specifically, whether there were a \nsufficient number of disinterested voters \n4. What benefit was missed by the corporation \n \nIn considering these factors, the Farber court held that the officers had breached a duty of loyalty to the \ncorporation by individually purchasing an asset that would have been deemed a corporate opportunity. \n \nWhen a director serves on more than one board, the problem of corporate opportunity becomes even \nmore complex, because he may be caught in a situation of conflicting loyalties. Moreover, multiple board \nmemberships pose another serious problem. A direct interlock occurs when one person sits on the \nboards of two different companies; an indirect interlock happens when directors of two different \ncompanies serve jointly on the board of a third company. The Clayton Act prohibits interlocking \ndirectorates between direct competitors. Despite this prohibition, as well as public displeasure, corporate \nboard member overlap is commonplace. According to an analysis by USA Today and The Corporate \nLibrary, eleven of the fifteen largest companies have at least two board members who also sit together on \nthe board of another corporation. Furthermore, CEOs of one corporation often sit on the boards of other \ncorporations. Bank board members may sit on the boards of other corporations, including the bank’s own \nclients. This web of connections has both pros and cons. [5] \n \nDuty of Care \nThe second major aspect of the director’s responsibility is that of duty of care. Section 8.30 of RMBCA \ncalls on the director to perform his duties “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position \nwould exercise under similar circumstances.” An “ordinarily prudent person” means one who directs his \nintelligence in a thoughtful way to the task at hand. Put another way, a director must make a reasonable \neffort to inform himself before making a decision, as discussed in the next paragraph. The director is not \nheld to a higher standard required of a specialist (finance, marketing) unless he is one. A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations",

The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations \nbecause it was the wrong decision, than a situation in which time was not of the essence. \n \nWhat of the care itself? What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

Under this rule, a court will not second-guess a director's decision if it was made in good faith and based on sound business judgment.

            "chunk": "these duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation. Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little. The court noted an exception to the general rule that permitted \ndirectors to consider the interests of other groups as long as “there are rationally related benefits accruing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n692 \nto the stockholders.” But when a company is about to be taken over, the object must be to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, Pantry Pride in this case. It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy. So \nbroadly worded are these laws that although the motive for enacting them was to give directors a weapon \nin fighting hostile tender offers, in some states the principle applies to any decision by a board of \ndirectors. So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies.

Prior to these statutes, directors were legally obligated to prioritize advancing shareholders' economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation. However, these new laws allow directors to consider factors such as employee welfare, local communities, and other stakeholders when making decisions. It's important to note that while these statutes do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties, which require selling the company to the highest bidder when it is up for sale, they do expand the scope of directors' considerations beyond just maximizing shareholder value. This shift towards corporate social responsibility can lead to more comprehensive decision-making processes that may benefit multiple parties involved with the corporation."

Second, they make it more difficult for \nshareholders to monitor the performance of a company’s board; measuring decisions against the single \ngoal of profit maximization is far easier than against the subjective goal of “balancing” a host of competing \ninterests. Constituency statutes run contrary to the concept of shareholders as owners, and of the \nfiduciary duties owed to them, effectively softening shareholder power. Nevertheless, since many states \nnow have constituency statutes, it is only reasonable to expect that the traditional doctrine holding \nshareholder interests paramount will begin to give way, even as the shareholders challenge new decisions \nby directors that favor communities, employees, and others with an important stake in the welfare of the \ncorporations with which they deal. For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers. In particular, Title III contains corporate responsibility \nprovisions, such as requiring senior executives to vouch for the accuracy and completeness of their \ncorporation’s financial disclosures. While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith.

Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage.

The duty of \nloyalty is a responsibility to act in the best interest of the corporation, even when that action may conflict with \na personal interest. This duty commonly arises in contracts with the corporation and with corporate \nopportunities. The duty of care requires directors and officers to act with the care of an ordinarily prudent \nperson in like circumstances. The business judgment rule may protect directors and officers, since courts give \na presumption to the corporation that its personnel are informed and act in good faith. A shareholder may file \na derivative lawsuit on behalf of the corporation against corporate insiders for breaches of these fiduciary \nobligations or other actions that harm the corporation. While directors and officers have obligations to the \ncorporation and its shareholders, they may weigh other considerations under constituency statutes. In \nresponse to recent debacles, state and federal laws, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, have placed further \nrequirements on officers and directors. Director and officer expenses in defending claims of wrongful acts may \nbe covered through indemnification or insurance. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n697 \n \n1.

This rule generally shields directors and officers from liability if their decisions were made in good faith, on an informed basis, and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation."

                    "answer": "State and federal laws, including Sarbanes-Oxley, have imposed additional requirements on directors and officers to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct. These laws often mandate stricter financial reporting standards, enhanced internal controls, and increased disclosure. To cover expenses related to defending claims of wrongful acts, directors and officers may rely on indemnification provisions in the company's bylaws or through insurance policies. Indemnification agreements typically provide that the corporation will reimburse directors and officers for costs associated with legal defense unless it is proven that they acted with intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or knowing violation of law."

This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated \npurpose is broader and this court cannot find that it is either necessary or convenient to that purpose for \nits membership to be restricted to men. It should be borne in mind that this club is one of the principal \nluncheon clubs for business and professional people in Stamford. It is a gathering place where a great \nmany of the civic, business, and professional affairs of the Stamford community are discussed in an \natmosphere of social intercourse. Given the scope of the entry of women today into the business and \nprofessional life of the community and the changing status of women before the law and in society, it \nwould be anomalous indeed for this court to conclude that it is either necessary or convenient to the \nstated purpose for which it was organized for this club to exclude women as members or guests. \n \nWhile the bylaws recognize the right of a member to bring guests to the club, the exclusion of women \nguests is nowhere authorized and would not appear to be any more necessary and convenient to the \npurpose of the club than the exclusion of women members. The bylaws at present contain no restrictions \nagainst female members or guests and even if they could be interpreted as authorizing those restrictions, \nthey would be of no validity in light of the requirement of § 33-459 (a) of the General Statutes, that the \nbylaws must be “reasonable [and] germane to the purposes of the corporation.…” \n \nThe court therefore concludes that the actions and policies of the defendants in excluding women as \nmembers and guests solely on the basis of sex is ultra vires and beyond the power of the corporation and \nits management under its certificate of incorporation and the Nonstock Corporation Act, and in \nderogation of the rights of the plaintiff as a member thereof.

The negotiations regarding Ovitz’s compensation were \nconducted predominantly by Eisner and two of the members of the compensation committee (a four-\nmember panel). The terms of Ovitz’s compensation were then presented to the full board. In a meeting \nlasting around one hour, where a variety of topics were discussed, the board approved Ovitz’s \ncompensation after reviewing only a term sheet rather than the full contract. Ovitz’s time at Disney was \ntumultuous and short-lived.]…In December 1996, only fourteen months after he commenced \nemployment, Ovitz was terminated without cause, resulting in a severance payout to Ovitz valued at \napproximately $ 130 million. [Disney shareholders then filed derivative actions on behalf of Disney \nagainst Ovitz and the directors of Disney at the time of the events complained of (the “Disney \ndefendants”), claiming that the $130 million severance payout was the product of fiduciary duty and \ncontractual breaches by Ovitz and of breaches of fiduciary duty by the Disney defendants and a waste of \nassets.

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be \nshown, for instance, where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the \nbest interests of the corporation, where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law, \nor where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a \nconscious disregard for his duties. There may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged, \nbut these three are the most salient. \n \n…Second, the legislature has also recognized this intermediate category of fiduciary misconduct, which \nranks between conduct involving subjective bad faith and gross negligence. Section 102(b)(7)(ii) of the \nDGCL expressly denies money damage exculpation for “acts or omissions not in good faith or which \ninvolve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.” By its very terms that provision \ndistinguishes between “intentional misconduct” and a “knowing violation of law” (both examples of \nsubjective bad faith) on the one hand, and “acts…not in good faith,” on the other. Because the statute \nexculpates directors only for conduct amounting to gross negligence, the statutory denial of exculpation \nfor “acts…not in good faith” must encompass the intermediate category of misconduct captured by the \nChancellor’s definition of bad faith. \n \nFor these reasons, we uphold the Court of Chancery’s definition as a legally appropriate, although not the \nexclusive, definition of fiduciary bad faith. We need go no further. To engage in an effort to craft (in the \nCourt’s words) “a definitive and categorical definition of the universe of acts that would constitute bad \nfaith” would be unwise and is unnecessary to dispose of the issues presented on this appeal.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n708 \n \nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Chancery is affirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

The corporation may \nalways amend the articles of incorporation to change its purposes. Nevertheless, shareholders may enjoin \ntheir corporation from acting ultra vires, as may the state attorney general. However, an individual \nstockholder, director, or officer (except in rare instances under certain regulatory statutes) may not be \nheld vicariously liable if he did not participate in the crime or tort. \n \nBecause ownership and control are separated in the modern publicly held corporation, shareholders \ngenerally do not make business decisions. Shareholders who own voting stock do retain the power to elect \ndirectors, amend the bylaws, ratify or reject certain corporate actions, and vote on certain extraordinary \nmatters, such as whether to amend the articles of incorporation, merge, or liquidate. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n709 \nIn voting for directors, various voting methodologies may be used, such as cumulative voting, which \nprovides safeguards against removal of minority-shareholder-supported directors. Shareholders may use \nseveral voting arrangements that concentrate power, including proxies, voting agreements, and voting \ntrusts. Proxies are regulated under rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n \nCorporations may deny preemptive rights—the rights of shareholders to prevent dilution of their \npercentage of ownership—by so stating in the articles of incorporation. Some states say that in the \nabsence of such a provision, shareholders do have preemptive rights; others say that there are no \npreemptive rights unless the articles specifically include them. \n \nDirectors have the ultimate authority to run the corporation and are fiduciaries of the firm.

Perhaps the most \nimportant of these is Section 4(3), which exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, \nunderwriter or dealer.” Section 4(3) also exempts most transactions of dealers. So the net is that trading \nin outstanding securities (the secondary market) is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of \n1933: you need not file a registration statement with the SEC every time you buy or sell securities through \na broker or dealer, for example. Other exemptions include the following: (1) private offerings to a limited \nnumber of persons or institutions who have access to the kind of information registration would disclose \nand who do not propose to redistribute the securities; (2) offerings restricted to the residents of the state \nin which the issuing company is organized and doing business; (3) securities of municipal, state, federal \nand other government instrumentalities, of charitable institutions, of banks, and of carriers subject to the \nInterstate Commerce Act; (4) offerings not in excess of certain specified amounts made in compliance \nwith regulations of the Commission…: and (5) offerings of “small business investment companies” made \nin accordance with rules and regulations of the Commission. \n \nPenalties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n720 \nSection 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 provides for fines not to exceed $10,000 and a prison term not to \nexceed five years, or both, for willful violations of any provisions of the act. This section makes these \ncriminal penalties specifically applicable to anyone who “willfully, in a registration statement filed under \nthis title, makes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be \nstated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.” \n \nSections 11 and 12 provide that anyone injured by false declarations in registration statements, \nprospectuses, or oral communications concerning the sale of the security—as well as anyone injured by \nthe unlawful failure of an issuer to register—may file a civil suit to recover the net consideration paid for \nthe security or for damages if the security has been sold. \n \nAlthough these civil penalty provisions apply only to false statements in connection with the registration \nstatement, prospectus, or oral communication, the Supreme Court held, in Case v. Borak, [2] that there is \nan “implied private right of action” for damages resulting from a violation of SEC rules under the act. \nThe Court’s ruling in Borak opened the courthouse doors to many who had been defrauded but were \npreviously without a practical remedy. \n \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 \nCompanies Covered \nThe Securities Act of 1933 is limited, as we have just seen, to new securities issues—that is \nthe primary market. The trading that takes place in the secondary market is far more significant, \nhowever. In a normal year, trading in outstanding stock totals some twenty times the value of new stock \nissues. \n \nTo regulate the secondary market, Congress enacted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This law, \nwhich created the SEC, extended the disclosure rationale to securities listed and registered for public \ntrading on the national securities exchanges. Amendments to the act have brought within its ambit every \ncorporation whose equity securities are traded over the counter if the company has at least $10 million in \nassets and five hundred or more shareholders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n721 \n \n \nReporting Proxy Solicitation \nAny company seeking listing and registration of its stock for public trading on a national exchange—or \nover the counter, if the company meets the size test—must first submit a registration application to both \nthe exchange and the SEC. The registration statement is akin to that filed by companies under the \nSecurities Act of 1933, although the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 calls for somewhat fewer disclosures. \nThereafter, companies must file annual and certain other periodic reports to update information in the \noriginal filing. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also covers proxy solicitation. Whenever management, or a \ndissident minority, seeks votes of holders of registered securities for any corporate purpose, disclosures \nmust be made to the stockholders to permit them to vote yes or no intelligently. \n \nPenalties \nThe logic of the Borak case (discussed in Section 17.1.3 \"Securities Act of 1933\") also applies to this act, so \nthat private investors may bring suit in federal court for violations of the statute that led to financial \ninjury.

World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., [1] the first accounting provisions \ncase brought to trial. \n \nInsider Trading \nCorporate insiders—directors, officers, or important shareholders—can have a substantial trading \nadvantage if they are privy to important confidential information. Learning bad news (such as financial \nloss or cancellation of key contracts) in advance of all other stockholders will permit the privileged few to \nsell shares before the price falls. Conversely, discovering good news (a major oil find or unexpected \nprofits) in advance gives the insider a decided incentive to purchase shares before the price rises. \nBecause of the unfairness to those who are ignorant of inside information, federal law \nprohibits insider trading. Two provisions of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act are \nparamount: Section 16(b) and 10(b). \n \nRecapture of Short-Swing Profits: Section 16(b) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n726 \nThe Securities Exchange Act assumes that any director, officer, or shareholder owning 10 percent or more \nof the stock in a corporation is using inside information if he or any family member makes a profit from \ntrading activities, either buying and selling or selling and buying, during a six-month period. Section 16(b) \npenalizes any such person by permitting the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover \nthe short-swing profits. The law applies to any company with more than $10 million in assets and at \nleast five hundred or more shareholders of any class of stock. \n \nSuppose that on January 1, Bob (a company officer) purchases one hundred shares of stock in BCT \nBookstore, Inc., for $60 a share. On September 1, he sells them for $100 a share. What is the result? Bob \nis in the clear, because his $4,000 profit was not realized during a six-month period. Now suppose that \nthe price falls, and one month later, on October 1, he repurchases one hundred shares at $30 a share and \nholds them for two years. What is the result? He will be forced to pay back $7,000 in profits even if he had \nno inside information. Why? In August, Bob held one hundred shares of stock, and he did again on \nOctober 1—within a six-month period. His net gain on these transactions was $7,000 ($10,000 realized \non the sale less the $3,000 cost of the purchase). \n \nAs a consequence of Section 16(b) and certain other provisions, trading in securities by directors, officers, \nand large stockholders presents numerous complexities. For instance, the law requires people in this \nposition to make periodic reports to the SEC about their trades. As a practical matter, directors, officers, \nand large shareholders should not trade in their own company stock in the short run without legal advice. \n \nInsider Trading: Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 \nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits any person from using the mails or \nfacilities of interstate commerce “to use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any \nsecurity…any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and \nregulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the \nprotection of investors.” In 1942, the SEC learned of a company president who misrepresented the \ncompany’s financial condition in order to buy shares at a low price from current stockholders. So the \ncommission adopted a rule under the authority of Section 10(b). Rule 10b-5, as it was dubbed, has \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n727 \nremained unchanged for more than forty years and has spawned thousands of lawsuits and SEC \nproceedings. It reads as follows: \n \nIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or \ninstrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national \nsecurities exchange, \n \n(1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, \n(2) to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary \nin order to make the statements made, in the light of circumstances under which they were made, \nnot misleading, or \n(3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a \nfraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. \n \nRule 10b-5 applies to any person who purchases or sells any security. It is not limited to securities \nregistered under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. It is not limited to publicly held companies.

This section penalizes such individuals by allowing the corporation or a shareholder suing on its behalf to recover the 'short-swing' profits. Specifically, if an individual buys and then sells within a six-month period, or sells and then repurchases within a six-month period, they are subject to this provision. For example, if Bob, a company officer, purchases 100 shares of BCT Bookstore, Inc., for $60 each on January 1 and sells them for $100 each on September 1, he would not be penalized since no six-month period was involved. However, if the stock price falls and he repurchases the same shares at $30 each on October 1 and holds them for two years, he would be required to pay back $7,000 in profits, as he held the shares within a six-month period and realized a net gain of $7,000 ($10,000 from the sale minus the $3,000 cost of the purchase)."

Essentially, it covers a wide range of fraudulent practices, such as misrepresenting financial conditions, and ensures transparency and honesty in securities transactions.

How does the court determine what is or is not material information? How does this differ from its previous \nrulings? \n2. What is the fraud-on-the-market theory? \n \n \n \n17.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond state corporation laws, federal statutes—most importantly, the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934—regulate the issuance and trading of corporate securities. The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock. Under Rule 10b-5, the SEC and private parties may sue \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n742 \ninsiders who traded on information not available to the general public, thus gaining an advantage in \neither selling or buying the stock. Insiders include company employees. \n \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended the 1934 act, creating more stringent penalties, increasing corporate \nregulation, and requiring greater transparency. \n \nEXERCISES",

                    "question": "What is the significance of the fraud-on-the-market theory in establishing reliance for a Rule 10b-5 cause of action?",
                    "answer": "The fraud-on-the-market theory plays a crucial role in establishing reliance for a Rule 10b-5 cause of action. According to this theory, in an efficient market, the price of a security reflects all publicly available information. Therefore, when a material misrepresentation is made, it affects the market price, and any investor relying on that price is presumed to have relied on the integrity of that price. This presumption simplifies the burden of proof for plaintiffs in such cases, as they do not need to provide direct evidence of their reliance on the misrepresentation. Instead, they can rely on the presumption that market prices reflect all available information, including any material misstatements. This theory helps to manage situations where direct proof of reliance might be difficult to obtain, thereby facilitating Rule 10b-5 litigation and supporting the congressional policy embodied in the 1934 Act."

                    "answer": "The court addresses the evidentiary burden on Rule 10b-5 plaintiffs trading on impersonal markets by employing presumptions, particularly the fraud-on-the-market theory. This theory posits that investors rely on the integrity of market prices, which reflect all publicly available information, including material misrepresentations. By accepting a presumption of reliance based on this theory, the court reduces the need for plaintiffs to prove, through speculative means, how they would have acted had they known the omitted material information or if the misrepresentation had not occurred. This approach is seen as fairer and more realistic, as it acknowledges the practical challenges faced by plaintiffs in demonstrating reliance in impersonal markets. The use of such presumptions aligns with public policy and judicial economy, ensuring that plaintiffs do not face an unnecessarily heavy evidentiary burden while still maintaining the integrity of the legal process."

(When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such. [1] \n \nFigure 18.1 Purchase of Assets \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n748 \n \n \nSuccessor Liability \nOne of the principal advantages of this method of expansion is that the acquiring company generally is not \nliable for the debts and/or lawsuits of the corporation whose assets it purchased, generally known \nas successor liability. Suppose BCT paid Flying Truckman $250,000 for its trucks, routes, and name. \nWith that cash, Flying Truckman paid off several of its creditors. Its shareholders then voted to dissolve \nthe corporation, leaving one creditor unsatisfied. The creditor can no longer sue Flying Truckman since it \ndoes not exist. So he sues BCT. Unless certain circumstances exist, as discussed in Ray v. Alad \nCorporation (see Section 18.4.1 \"Successor Liability\"), BCT is not liable for Flying Truckman’s debts. \n \nSeveral states, although not a majority, have adopted the Ray product-line exception approach to \nsuccessor liability. The general rule is that the purchasing corporation does not take the liabilities of the \nacquired corporation. Several exceptions exist, as described in Ray, the principal exception being the \nproduct-line approach. This minority exception has been further limited in several jurisdictions by \napplying it solely to cases involving products liability. Other jurisdictions also permit a continuity-of-\nenterprise exception, whereby the court examines how closely the acquiring corporation’s business is to \nthe acquired corporation’s business (e.g., see Turner v. Bituminous Casualty Co.).[2] \n \nMerger \nWhen the assets of a company are purchased, the selling company itself may or may not go out of \nexistence. By contrast, in a merger, the acquired company goes out of existence by being absorbed into the \nacquiring company. In the example in Section 18.1.2 \"Merger\", Flying Truck would merge into BCT, \nresulting in Flying Truckman losing its existence. The acquiring company receives all of the acquired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n749 \ncompany’s assets, including physical property and intangible property such as contracts and goodwill. The \nacquiring company also assumes all debts of the acquired company. \n \nA merger begins when two or more corporations negotiate an agreement outlining the specifics of a \nmerger, such as which corporation survives and the identities of management personnel. There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash. These shareholders retain no interest in the \nsurviving corporation, having been bought out. This is often called a freeze-out merger, since the \nshareholders of the disappearing corporation are frozen out of an interest in the surviving corporation. \n \nIn a noncash merger, the shareholders of the disappearing corporation retain an interest in the surviving \ncorporation. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade their shares for shares in the \nsurviving corporation; thus they retain an interest in the surviving corporation when they become \nshareholders of that surviving corporation. \n \nUnless the articles of incorporation state otherwise, majority approval of the merger by both boards of \ndirectors and both sets of shareholders is necessary (see Figure 18.2 \"Merger\"). The shareholder majority \nmust be of the total shares eligible to vote, not merely of the total actually represented at the special \nmeeting called for the purpose of determining whether to merge. \n \nFigure 18.2 Merger \n \n \nConsolidation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n750 \nConsolidation is virtually the same as a merger. The companies merge, but the resulting entity is a new \ncorporation. Returning to our previous example, BCT and Flying Truckman could consolidate and form a \nnew corporation. As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del.

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days. The Williams Act, which made certain amendments to the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934, can be viewed at http://taft.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/. The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

[2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause.

Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes. A state may tax a foreign corporation as long as it does \nnot burden interstate commerce. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n759 \n \n1.

As Justice Cardozo said while serving as chief judge of the New York court of appeals: “Neither \nbankruptcy…nor cessation of business…nor dispersion of stockholders, nor the absence of directors…nor \nall combined, will avail without more to stifle the breath of juristic personality. The corporation abides as \nan ideal creation, impervious to the shocks of these temporal vicissitudes.

There are several generally recognized exceptions, such as when \nthe asset purchase is fraudulent or to avoid creditors. Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business. The \nacquiring corporation assumes the other company’s debts. Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There \nare two main types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. A consolidation is virtually the same \nas a merger, except that the resulting entity is a new corporation. \n \nA corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly \nreferred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using \nthe target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target. \nA shareholder has the right to fair value for his stock if he dissents from a plan to merge, consolidate, or \nsell all or substantially all of the corporate assets, referred to as appraisal rights. If there is disagreement \nover the value, the shareholder has the right to a court appraisal. When one company acquires 90 percent \nof the stock of another, it may merge with the target through a short-form merger, which eliminates the \nrequirement of consent of shareholders and the target company’s board. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n771 \nCertain federal regulations are implicated in corporate expansion, particularly the Williams Act. States \nmay impose conditions on admission of a foreign corporation to do business of a purely local nature but \nnot if its business is exclusively interstate in character, which would violate the Commerce Clause. Among \nthe requirements are obtaining a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and maintaining a \nregistered office with a registered agent. But certain activities do not constitute doing business, such as \nfiling lawsuits and collecting debts, and may be carried on even if the corporation is not licensed to do \nbusiness in a state. Under long-arm statutes, state courts have jurisdiction over foreign corporations as \nlong as the corporations have minimum contacts in the state. States may also tax corporate activities as \nlong as the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce. \n \nDissolution is the legal termination of a corporation’s existence, as distinguished from liquidation, the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. A corporation may be dissolved by shareholders if they \nunanimously agree in writing, or by majority vote of the directors and shareholders. A corporation may \nalso be dissolved involuntarily on one of five grounds, including failure to file an annual report or to pay \ntaxes. Shareholders may sue for judicial liquidation on a showing that corporate assets are being wasted \nor directors or officers are acting illegally or fraudulently. \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

What is required for paper to be negotiable \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n774 \n \n \nHere we begin our examination of commercial paper, documents representing an obligation by one \nparty to pay another money. You are familiar with one kind of commercial paper: a check. \n \n \n19.1 Introduction to Commercial Paper \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand why commercial paper is an important concept in modern finance. \n2. Be familiar with the historical development of commercial paper. \n3. Recognize how commercial paper is viewed in economics and finance. \n \n \n \n \nThe Importance of Commercial Paper \nBecause commercial paper is a vital invention for the working of our economic system, brief attention to \nits history and its function as a medium of exchange in economics and finance is appropriate. \n \nThe Central Role of Commercial Paper \nCommercial paper is the collective term for various financial instruments, or tools, that include checks \ndrawn on commercial banks, drafts (drawn on something other than a bank), certificates of deposit, and \nnotes evidencing a promise to pay. Like money, commercial paper is a medium of exchange, but because it \nis one step removed from money, difficulties arise that require a series of interlocking rules to protect \nboth sellers and buyers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n775 \nTo understand the importance of commercial paper, consider the following example. It illustrates a \ndistinction that is critical to the discussion in our four chapters on commercial paper. \n \nLorna Love runs a tennis club. She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank.

                    "question": "What were the legal consequences for the bank's attempt to collect from Lorna Love in the scenario where Rackets, Inc. shipped warped tennis rackets?",
                    "answer": "In the scenario described, the bank could not collect from Lorna Love the full amount of the contract rights it purchased from Rackets, Inc. This is due to the application of the 'shoe rule' in contract law. According to the shoe rule, when an assignee acquires rights from an assignor, the assignee steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes those rights subject to any defenses that the obligor might have against the assignor. In this case, since the tennis rackets were commercially worthless, Love had a valid defense against paying Rackets, Inc. Therefore, even though the bank owned the contract rights, Love could still assert her defense that the rackets were worthless, preventing the bank from recovering the full $100,000 from her. This principle underscores the importance of due diligence in verifying the quality and condition of goods before entering into contracts, especially when dealing with large sums of money."

                    "question": "How does the nature of a negotiable instrument affect the enforceability of the rights held by the bank in the context of the assignment of contract rights?",
                    "answer": "The nature of a negotiable instrument can significantly impact the enforceability of the rights held by the bank in the context of the assignment of contract rights. In the given scenario, if the note issued by Lorna Love to Rackets, Inc. was a negotiable instrument, the bank could potentially have a stronger claim against Love. Negotiable instruments are designed to be transferred freely and are subject to a set of uniform rules that ensure their enforceability regardless of the underlying transaction. If the note met all the requirements for negotiability, the bank would step into Rackets, Inc.'s shoes and have the right to enforce the note against Love, provided the bank had properly taken delivery of the note and complied with all necessary formalities. However, if the note was nonnegotiable, the bank's ability to enforce the rights would be limited, as it would not automatically assume the assignor's defenses. This highlights the importance of understanding the legal characteristics of negotiable instruments and ensuring they meet the necessary criteria for enforceability."

An indorsement is defined by \nUCC Section 3-204(a) as \n \na signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied \nby other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii) \nrestricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on the instrument, but \nregardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement \nunless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other \ncircumstances unambiguously indicated that the signature was made for a purpose other than \nindorsement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n817 \n \n \nPlacement of Indorsement \nIndorse (or endorse) literally means “on the back of,” as fish, say, have dorsal fins—fins on their backs. \nUsually indorsements are on the back of the instrument, but an indorsement could be on a piece of paper \naffixed to the instrument. Such an attachment is called an allonge—it comes along with the instrument \n(UCC, Section 3-204(a)). \n \nThere are rules about where indorsements are placed. The Expedited Funds Availability Act was enacted \nin 1987 by Congress to standardize holding periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate \ninstitutions’ use of deposit holds—that is, how soon customers can access the money after they have \ndeposited a check in the bank. The Federal Reserve Board subsequently adopted “Regulation CC, Check \nEndorsement Standards” to improve funds availability and expedite the return of checks. See Figure 20.3 \n\"Indorsement Standard\". \n \nFigure 20.3 Indorsement Standard \n \nFrom UC Irvine Administrative Policies & Procedures, Business and Financial Affairs, Financial \nServices, Sec. 704-13: Check Endorsement Procedures, \nathttp://www.policies.uci.edu/adm/procs/700/704-13.html. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n818 \nAs shown in Figure 20.3 \"Indorsement Standard\", specific implementing guidelines define criteria for the \nplacement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank \n(bank of first deposit), subsequent indorsers (paying banks), and corporate or payee indorsers. \nIndorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; \nremaining space is for bank indorsements. There is no penalty for violating the standard—it is a guideline. \nThe abbreviation “MICR” stands for magnetic ink character recognition. The “clear band” is a section of \nthe back of the check that is not supposed to be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) \nprinting that would interfere with machine reading on the front side (the bank routing numbers). \n \nSometimes an indorser adds words intended to strengthen the indorsement; for example, “I hereby assign \nall my right, title, and interest in this note to Carl Carpenter.” Words of assignment such as these and also \nwords of condition, waiver, guaranty, limitation, or disclaimer of liability do not negate the effect of an \nindorsement. \n \nMisspelled or Incorrect Indorsements \nWhen the instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name (or in a name other than his \nown), he may indorse in the wrong name or the right one or both. It is safer to sign in both names, and the \npurchaser of the instrument may demand a signature in both names (UCC, Section 3-204(d)). \n \nVarious Indorsements and Their Effects \nA holder can indorse in a variety of ways; indorsements are not identical and have different effects. \n \nNo Indorsement \nIf the instrument requires a signature, transfer without indorsement is an assignment only. Bearer paper \ndoes not require indorsement, so it can be negotiated simply by delivering it to the transferee, who \nbecomes a holder. The transferor has no contract liability on the instrument, however, because he has not \nsigned it. He does remain liable on the warranties, but only to the person who receives the paper, not to \nsubsequent transferees. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n819 \nBecause it is common practice for a depository bank (the bank into which a person makes a deposit) to \nreceive unindorsed checks under so-called lockbox agreements from customers who receive a high volume \nof checks, a customer who is a holder can deposit a check or other instrument for credit to his account \nwithout indorsement.

Section 4-205(1) of the UCC provides that a “depositary bank becomes a holder…at \nthe time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder, whether or \nnot the customer indorses the item.” \n \nPartial Indorsement \nTo be effective as negotiation, an indorsement must convey the entire instrument. An indorsement that \npurports to convey only a portion of the sum still due amounts to a partial assignment. If Rackets’ agent \nsigns the check “Rackets, Inc.” together with the words “Pay half to City Water, /s/ Agent” and delivers \nthe check to City Water, that does not operate as an indorsement, and City Water becomes an assignee, \nnot a holder. \n \nBlank Indorsement \nA blank indorsement consists of the indorser’s signature alone (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of \nEndorsement\", left). A blank indorsement converts the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since \nthe indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—\nassuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A \npaper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it \ninto aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the \nindorsement. For example, a check indorsed by the payee (signed on the back) may be passed from one \nperson to another and cashed in by any of them. \n \nFigure 20.4 Forms of Endorsement \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n820 \nA blank indorsement creates conditional contract liability in the indorser: he is liable to pay if the paper is \ndishonored. The blank indorser also has warranty liability toward subsequent holders. \n \nSpecial Indorsement \nA special indorsement, sometimes known as an “indorsement in full,” names the transferee-holder. \nThe payee of a check can indorse it over to a third party by writing “Pay to the order of [name of the third \nparty]” and then signing his name (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", center). Once specially \nindorsed, the check (or other instrument) can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds \nhis own signature. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above \nthe signature of the indorser words of a contractual nature consistent with the character of the \ninstrument. \n \nSo, for example, Lorna Love’s check to Rackets, Inc., indorsed in blank (signed by its agent or stamped \nwith Rackets’ indorsement stamp—its name alone) and handed to City Water, is not very safe: it is bearer \npaper. If the check fell onto the floor, anybody could be a holder and cash it. It can easily be converted into \na check with special indorsement: City Water’s clerk need only add the words “Pay City Water” above \nRackets’ indorsement. (The magic words of negotiability—“pay to order of bearer”—are not required in an \nindorsement.) Before doing so, City Water could have negotiated it simply by giving it to someone (again, \na blank indorsement acts as bearer paper). After converting it to a special indorsement, City Water must \nindorse it in order to transfer it by negotiation to someone else. The liabilities of a special indorser are the \nsame as those of a blank indorser. \n \nThe dichotomy here of indorsement in blank or special indorsement is the indorser’s way of indicating \nhow the instrument can be subsequently negotiated: with or without further indorsing. \n \nRestrictive Indorsement \nA restrictive indorsement attempts to limit payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibit \nfurther transfer or negotiation. We say “attempts to limit” because a restrictive indorsement is generally \ninvalid. Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded.

At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

He first received a check from the United States Treasury through the Farm Service Agency, made payable to him but with a typed statement directing a portion of the funds to be paid to Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. ('Wisner'). On July 23, 2001, he deposited the check into his own checking account at Richland State Bank, signing his name below the typed instruction without issuing a cashier's check to Wisner as directed. This action effectively nullified the restrictive endorsement since Gill's signature transformed it into his own indorsement. As a result, he had the legal power to direct the bank to deposit the full amount into his account, which the bank complied with. The trial court upheld this decision, concluding that Gill's action of depositing the full amount into his account waived any restrictions or conditions placed on the check by the original indorsement."

This section states that 'An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument.'

There are, however, several exceptions to this rule: where an imposter induces \nthe maker or drawer to issue an instrument in the name of the payee, where the instrument is made to a \nfictitious payee (or to a real person who is intended to have no interest in it), and where the instrument is \nmade by an employee authorized generally to deal in such paper \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nMal, a minor, purchased a stereo from Howard for $425 and gave Howard a negotiable note in that \namount.

So a holder is one who \npossesses an instrument and who has all the necessary indorsements. \n \nTaken for Value \nSection 3-303 of the UCC describes what is meant by transferring an instrument “for value.” In a broad \nsense, it means the holder has given something for it, which sounds like consideration. But “value” here is \nnot the same as consideration under contract law. Here is the UCC language: \n \nAn instrument is issued or transferred for value if any of the following apply: \n \n(1) The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the \npromise has been performed. \n(2) The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien \nobtained by judicial proceeding. \n(3) The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim \nagainst any person, whether or not the claim is due. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n856 \n(4) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument. \n(5) The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable \nobligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument. \n \n1. For a promise, to the extent performed. Suppose A contracts with B: “I’ll buy your car for $5,000.” \nUnder contract law, A has given consideration: the promise is enough. But this executory (not yet \nperformed) promise given by A is not giving “value” to support the HDC status because the promise has \nnot been performed. \n \nLorna Love sells her car to Paul Purchaser for $5,000, and Purchaser gives her a note in that amount. \nLove negotiates the note to Rackets, Inc., for a new shipment of tennis rackets to be delivered in thirty \ndays. Rackets never delivers the tennis rackets. Love has a claim for $5,000 against Rackets, which is not \nan HDC because its promise to deliver is still executory. Assume Paul Purchaser has a defense against \nLove (a reason why he doesn’t want to pay on the note), perhaps because the car was defective. When \nRackets presents the note to Purchaser for payment, he refuses to pay, raising his defense against Love. If \nRackets had been an HDC, Purchaser would be obligated to pay on the note regardless of the defense he \nmight have had against Love, the payee. See Carter & Grimsley v. Omni Trading, Inc., Section 21.3 \n\"Cases\", regarding value as related to executory contracts. \n \nA taker for value can be a partial HDC if the consideration was only partly performed. Suppose the tennis \nrackets were to come in two lots, each worth $2,500, and Rackets only delivered one lot. Rackets would be \nan HDC only to the extent of $2,500, and the debtor—Paul Purchaser—could refuse to pay $2,500 of the \npromised sum. \n \nThe UCC presents two exceptions to the rule that an executory promise is not value. Section 3-303(a)(4) \nprovides that an instrument is issued or transferred for value if the issuer or transferor gives it in \nexchange for a negotiable instrument, and Section 3-303(5) says an instrument is transferred for value if \nthe issuer gives it in exchange for an irrevocable obligation to a third party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n857 \n2. Security interest. Value is not limited to cash or the fulfillment of a contractual obligation. A holder \nwho acquires a lien on, or a security interest in, an instrument other than by legal process has taken for \nvalue. \n \n3. Antecedent debt. Likewise, taking an instrument in payment of, or as security for, a prior claim, \nwhether or not the claim is due, is a taking for value. Blackstone owes Webster $1,000, due in thirty days. \nBlackstone unexpectedly receives a refund check for $1,000 from the Internal Revenue Service and \nindorses it to Webster. Webster is an HDC though he gave value in the past. \n \nThe rationale for the rule of value is that if the holder has not yet given anything of value in exchange for \nthe instrument, he still has an effective remedy should the instrument prove defective: he can rescind the \ntransaction, given the transferor’s breach of warranty. \n \nIn Good Faith \nSection 3-103(4) of the UCC defines good faith as “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable \ncommercial standards of fair dealing.” \n \nHonesty in Fact \n“Honesty in fact” is subjectively tested. Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test. That is not to say that",

Camp \n825 N.E.2d 644 (Ohio App. 2005) \n \nDonovan, J. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n872 \nDefendant-appellant Shawn Sheth appeals from a judgment of the Xenia Municipal Court in favor of \nplaintiff-appellee Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. (“Buckeye”). Sheth contends that the trial court erred in \nfinding that Buckeye was a holder in due course of a postdated check drawn by Sheth and therefore was \nentitled to payment on the instrument despite the fact that Sheth had issued a stop-payment order to his \nbank. \n \nIn support of this assertion, Sheth argues that the trial court did not use the correct legal standard in \ngranting holder-in-due-course status to Buckeye. In particular, Sheth asserts that the trial court used the \npre-1990 Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) definition of “good faith” as it pertains to holder-in-due-\ncourse status, which defined it as “honesty in fact.” The definition of “good faith” was extended by the \nauthors of the UCC in 1990 to also mean “the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair \ndealing.” The post-1990 definition was adopted by the Ohio legislature in 1994. \n \nSheth argues that while Buckeye would prevail under the pre-1990, “honesty in fact” definition of “good \nfaith,” it failed to act in a commercially reasonable manner when it chose to cash the postdated check \ndrawn by Sheth. The lower court…adjudged Buckeye to be a holder in due course and, therefore, entitled \nto payment. We conclude that the trial court used the incorrect “good faith” standard when it granted \nholder-in-due-course status to Buckeye because Buckeye did not act in a commercially reasonable manner \nwhen it cashed the postdated check drawn by Sheth. Because we accept Sheth’s sole assignment of error, \nthe judgment of the trial court is reversed. \n \nOn or about October 12, 2003, Sheth entered into negotiations with James A. Camp for Camp to provide \ncertain services to Sheth by October 15, 2003. To that end, Sheth issued Camp a check for $1,300. The \ncheck was postdated to October 15, 2003. \n \nOn October 13, 2003, Camp negotiated the check to Buckeye and received a payment of $1,261.31. \nApparently fearing that Camp did not intend to fulfill his end of the contract, Sheth contacted his bank on \nOctober 14, 2003, and issued a stop-payment order on the check. Unaware of the stop-payment order, \nBuckeye deposited the check with its own bank on October 14, 2003, believing that the check would reach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n873 \nSheth’s bank by October 15, 2003. Because the stop-payment order was in effect, the check was ultimately \ndishonored by Sheth’s bank. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain payment directly from Sheth, \nBuckeye brought suit. \n \nSheth’s sole assignment of error is as follows: \n \n“The trial court erred by applying the incorrect legal standard in granting holder in due course status to \nthe plaintiff-appellee because the plaintiff-appellee failed to follow commercially reasonable standards in \nelecting to cash the check that gives rise to this dispute.” \n \n[UCC 3-302] outlines the elements required to receive holder-in-due-course status. The statute states: \n \n…‘holder in due course’ means the holder of an instrument if both of the following apply: \n \n“(1) The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear evidence of forgery or \nalteration that is so apparent, or is otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question \nits authenticity; \n“(2) The holder took the instrument under all of the following circumstances: \n(a) For value; \n(b) In good faith; \n(c) Without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an \nuncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series; \n(d) Without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered; \n(e) Without notice of any claim to the instrument as described in [3-306];",

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable. Thus, a holder may be \naccorded holder in due course where it acts pursuant to those reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing—even if it is negligent—but may lose that status, even where it complies with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n875 \ncommercial standards, if those standards are not reasonably related to achieving fair dealing.” \n[Citation] \n \nCheck cashing is an unlicensed and unregulated business in Ohio. [Citation] Thus, there are no concrete \ncommercial standards by which check-cashing businesses must operate. Moreover, Buckeye argues that \nits own internal operating policies do not require that it verify the availability of funds, nor does Buckeye \napparently have any guidelines with respect to the acceptance of postdated checks. Buckeye asserts that \ncashing a postdated check does not prevent a holder from obtaining holder-in-due-course status and cites \nseveral cases in support of this contention. All of the cases cited by Buckeye, however, were decided prior \nto the UCC’s addition of the objective prong to the definition of “good faith.” \n \nUnder a purely subjective “honesty in fact” analysis, it is clear that Buckeye accepted the check from Camp \nin good faith and would therefore achieve holder-in-due-course status. When the objective prong of the \ngood faith test is applied, however, we find that Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially \nreasonable manner. While not going so far as to say that cashing a postdated check prevents a holder from \nobtaining holder-in-due-course status in every instance, the presentation of a postdated check should put \nthe check cashing entity on notice that the check might not be good. Buckeye accepted the postdated \ncheck at its own peril. Some attempt at verification should be made before a check-cashing business",

Specifically, the instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder must not bear evidence of forgery or alteration that is so apparent, or is otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity. Additionally, the holder must have taken the instrument under the following circumstances: for value, in good faith, without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series, without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered, without notice of any claim to the instrument as described in [3-306], and without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in [UCC 3-305(a)]. Prior to the amendment in 1994, the definition of 'good faith' in UCC 1-201 was simply 'honesty in fact', meaning the absence of bad faith or dishonesty with respect to a party's conduct within a commercial transaction. However, after the amendment, the definition of 'good faith' includes both the subjective 'honesty in fact' test and an objective test of 'the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing'.

                    "answer": "The amendment to UCC 1-201 in 1994 expanded the definition of 'good faith' to include both a subjective 'honesty in fact' test and an objective test of 'the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing'. This change meant that a holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective and an objective test of good faith. For check cashing businesses like Buckeye, this has significant implications. Prior to the amendment, if a holder acted honestly and in good faith, they could be considered a holder in due course regardless of the specific transaction. However, under the new objective prong of the good faith analysis, a check cashing business must now conduct itself in a commercially reasonable manner. This means that while Buckeye accepted the check from Camp in good faith and would likely satisfy the subjective 'honesty in fact' test, their acceptance of a postdated check without any attempt at verification could be seen as not conforming to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Therefore, Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially reasonable manner and thus did not satisfy the objective prong of the good faith test, leading to the conclusion that Buckeye is not a holder in due course."

The HDC takes the paper free of most defenses; an ordinary holder \ntakes the paper as an assignee, acquiring only the rights of the assignor. \n \nValue is not the same as consideration; hence, a promise will not satisfy this criterion until it has been \nperformed. The HDC must have given something of value other than a promise to give. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n884 \nGood faith means (1) honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned and (2) the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Honesty in fact is a subjective test, but the observance of \nreasonable commercial standards is objective. \n \nNotice is not limited to receipt of an explicit statement of defenses; a holder may be given notice through \ninferences that should be drawn from the character of the instrument. Thus an incomplete instrument, \none that bears marks of forgery, or one that indicates it is overdue may give notice on its face. Certain \nfacts do not necessarily give notice of defense or claim: that the instrument is antedated or postdated, that \nthe instrument was negotiated in return for an executory promise, that any party has signed for \naccommodation, that an incomplete instrument has been completed, that any person negotiating the \ninstrument is or was a fiduciary, or that there has been default in payment of interest or principal. \nA person who could not have become an HDC directly (e.g., because he had notice of a defense or claim) \nmay become so if he takes as transferee from an HDC as long as he was not a party to any fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument or had not previously been a holder with notice of a defense or claim. \nThis is the shelter rule. \n \nHolders in due course are not immune from all defenses. A real, as opposed to a personal, defense may be \nasserted against the HDC. Personal defenses include fraud in the inducement, failure of consideration, \nnonperformance of a condition precedent, and the like. Real defenses consist of infancy, acts that would \nmake a contract void (such as duress), fraud in the execution, forgery, and discharge in bankruptcy.

                    "answer": "A holder is considered a holder in due course (HDC) if they take the instrument without reason to question its authenticity due to obvious facial irregularities, for value, in good faith, and without notice that it is overdue or has been dishonored, or that it contains a forgery or alteration, or that any person has any defense against it or claim to it. This means that the HDC must take the instrument without knowledge of any defenses or claims against it, and must provide something of value beyond just a promise. Additionally, the holder must act honestly in fact and observe reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. However, it's important to note that while HDCs are generally immune from most defenses, they are not completely immune from all defenses. Personal defenses such as fraud in the inducement, failure of consideration, nonperformance of a condition precedent, and the like can still be asserted against an HDC. Real defenses, including infancy, acts that would make a contract void (such as duress), fraud in the execution, forgery, and discharge in bankruptcy, can also be raised."

                    "answer": "The shelter rule is significant in the context of holders in due course (HDC) because it allows a person who might not otherwise qualify as an HDC to obtain the protections afforded by the HDC status. Specifically, if a person takes a negotiable instrument as a transferee from another HDC and does not participate in any fraud or illegal activity related to the instrument, they can become an HDC even if they had prior notice of a defense or claim against the instrument. This rule provides a layer of protection for subsequent transferees who are not directly involved in any wrongdoing and helps to ensure that the HDC status can be passed along in a chain of transfers. Essentially, the shelter rule creates a safe harbor for those who are not directly responsible for any issues with the instrument but are still able to benefit from the HDC protections if they acquire the instrument from another HDC under these conditions."

Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with \nthird parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Able signs his name on a note with an entirely illegible squiggle. Is that a valid signature? \n2. Under what circumstances is an agent clearly not personally liable on an instrument? \n3.

In each of these cases, the UCC states that the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the instrument without notice that the agent wasn't intended to be liable on the instrument. However, as to any other person (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she can prove that the original parties to the instrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Furthermore, the UCC specifies that an unauthorized signature is not binding and is 'ineffective except as the signature of the unauthorized signer,' meaning that if an unauthorized person signs an instrument, the only person liable is the unauthorized signer. However, there are two exceptions: an unauthorized signature may be ratified by the principal, and if negligence contributed to an instrument's alteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who in good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection."

Martin agreed to represent the company. \n \nOn September 8, 2008, Martin received a check for $290,986.15 from a purported Chipang Lee Song \nManufacturing Company customer, even though Martin had yet to commence any collections work. The \ncheck, which was drawn on First Century Bank USA, arrived in an envelope with a Canadian postmark \nand no return address. The check was accompanied by an undated transmittal letter. Martin endorsed the \ncheck and deposited it in his client trust account at PNC. Martin then e-mailed Hidotashi, reported that \nhe had deposited the check, and stated that he would await further instructions. \n \nHidotashi responded to Martin’s e-mail message on September 9, 2008.

PNC moves for summary judgment on both counts. \n \nII. Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault. [Citation] Martin, in any event, fails to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n928 \nsupport Friedman’s and Jennewein’s statements with firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits, so the \nstatements do not qualify as competent evidence. [Citation] \n \nMartin claims that the risk of loss falls on the bank. But the cases Martin cites in support of that \nproposition suffer from two defects. First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930]. The one modern case that Martin cites is also inapposite because the case involves a \ndrawer and a drawee bank. [Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the",

Additionally, Martin made representations that he was entitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. However, the check was a counterfeit, making these representations false. Furthermore, PNC argued that the risk of loss fell on Martin regardless of any mistakes made by PNC or Martin, as the transfer warranties placed the risk on the transferor. This risk was not mitigated by the fact that Friedman and Jennewein admitted to making a mistake, as the statements were deemed immaterial due to the lack of firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits. PNC also cited modern and historical cases to support their argument that the risk of loss in such situations lies with the transferor, which in this case was Martin."

The act provides certain warranties to protect \nrecipients of substitute checks that are intended to protect recipients against losses associated with the \ncheck substitution process. One of these warranties provides that “[a] bank that transfers, presents, or \nreturns a substitute check…for which it receives consideration warrants…that…[t]he substitute check \nmeets the requirements of legal equivalence” (12 CFR § 229.52(a)(1)). The Check 21 Act does not replace \nexisting state laws regarding such instruments. The Uniform Commercial Code still applies, and we turn \nto it next. \n \nTwo notable consequences of the Check 21 Act are worth mentioning. The first is that a check may be \npresented to the payor bank for payment very quickly, perhaps in less than an hour: the customer’s “float” \ntime is abbreviated. That means be sure you have enough money in your account to cover the checks that \nyou write. The second consequence of Check 21 Act is that it is now possible for anybody—you at home or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n944 \nthe merchant from whom you are buying something—to scan a check and deposit it instantly. “Remote \ndeposit capture” allows users to transmit a scanned image of a check for posting and clearing using a web-\nconnected computer and a check scanner. The user clicks to send the deposit to the desired existing bank \naccount. Many merchants are using this system: that’s why if you write a check at the hardware store you \nmay see it scanned and returned immediately to you. The digital data are transmitted, and the scanned \nimage may be retrieved, if needed, as a “substitute check.” \n \nUCC Article 4: Aspects of Bank Operations \nReason for Article 4 \nOver the years, the states had begun to enact different statutes to regulate the check collection process. \nEighteen states adopted the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code; many others enacted \nDeferred Posting statutes. Not surprisingly, a desire for uniformity was the principal reason for the \nadoption of UCC Article 4. Article 4 absorbed many of the rules of the American Bankers Association Code \nand of the principles of the Deferred Posting statutes, as well as court decisions and common customs not \npreviously codified. \n \nBanks Covered \nArticle 4 covers three types of banks: depository banks, payor banks, and collecting banks. These terms—\nalready mentioned earlier—are defined in UCC Section 4-105. A depositary bank is the first bank to which \nan item is transferred for collection. Section 4-104 defines “item” as “an instrument or a promise or order \nto pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment[,]…not including a credit or debit card slip.” A \npayor bank is any bank that must pay a check because it is drawn on the bank or accepted there—the \ndrawee bank (a depositary bank may also be a payor bank). A collecting bank is any bank except the payor \nbank that handles the item for collection. \n \nTechnical Rules \nDetailed coverage of Parts 2 and 3 of Article 4, the substantive provisions, is beyond the scope of this \nbook. However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1.

With the Check 21 Act, this period is significantly reduced, meaning customers need to ensure they have sufficient funds in their accounts to cover the checks they write. Additionally, the act enables remote deposit capture, allowing customers to scan and deposit checks instantly using a web-connected computer and a check scanner. This feature is particularly useful for merchants, who can scan checks and return them to customers immediately, enhancing convenience and efficiency."

The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund? The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First \nBank, and you deposit it in Second Bank. Second Bank will make a “provisional settlement” with \nyou—that is, it will provisionally credit your account with $1,000, and that settlement will be final \nwhen First Bank debits the check writer’s account and credits Second Bank with the funds. Under \nSection 4-212(1), as long as the settlement was still provisional, a collecting bank has the right to a \n“charge-back” or refund if the check “bounces” (is dishonored). However, if settlement was final, the \nbank cannot claim a refund. \n \nWhat determines whether settlement is provisional or final? Section 4-213(1) spells out four events \n(whichever comes first) that will convert a payor bank’s provisional settlement into final settlement: \nWhen it (a) pays the item in cash; (b) settles without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n946 \nunder statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer; finishes posting the item to the \nappropriate account; or (d) makes provisional settlement and fails to revoke the settlement in the time \nand manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement. All clearinghouses have rules \npermitting revocation of settlement within certain time periods. For example an item cleared before 10 \na.m. may be returned and the settlement revoked before 2 p.m. From this section it should be apparent \nthat a bank generally can prevent a settlement from becoming final if it chooses to do so. \n \nRelationship with Customers \nThe relationship between a bank and its customers is governed by UCC Article 4. However, Section 4-\n103(1) permits the bank to vary its terms, except that no bank can disclaim responsibility for failing to act \nin good faith or to exercise ordinary care. Most disputes between bank and customer arise when the bank \neither pays or refuses to pay a check. Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified.",

This means that the settlement is not yet final and can be reversed if the check is dishonored. According to Section 4-213(1), a bank can prevent a settlement from becoming final by paying the item in cash, settling without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right under statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer, finishing posting the item to the appropriate account, or making a provisional settlement and failing to revoke the settlement in the time and manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement. Clearinghouses typically have rules permitting the revocation of settlements within certain time periods, such as an item cleared before 10 a.m. being returnable and the settlement revocable before 2 p.m."

Responding to the need for consumer protection, \nCongress adopted the Electronic Fund Transfers Act, effective in 1978.

Understand what a “wholesale transaction” is; recognize that UCC Article 4A governs such transactions, and \nrecognize how the Article addresses three common issues. \n2. Know what a “letter of credit” (LC) is, the source of law regarding LCs, and how such instruments are used. \n \n \nWholesale Funds Transfers \nAnother way that money is transferred is by commercial fund transfers or wholesale funds transfers, \nwhich is by far the largest segment of the US payment system measured in amounts of money transferred. \nIt is trillions of dollars a day. Wholesale transactions are the transfers of funds between businesses or \nfinancial institutions. \n \nBackground and Coverage \nIt was in the development of commercial “wholesale wire transfers” of money in the nineteeth and early \ntwentieth centuries that businesses developed the processes enabling the creation of today’s consumer \nelectronic funds transfers. Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A. Consistent with other UCC provisions, the rights and \nobligations under Article 4A may be varied by agreement of the parties. Article 4A does not apply if any \nstep of the transaction is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Although the implication may be \notherwise, the rules in Article 4A apply to any funds transfer, not just electronic ones (i.e., transfers by \nmail are covered, too). Certainly, however, electronic transfers are most common, and—as the Preface to \nArticle 4A notes—a number of characteristics of them influenced the Code’s rules. These transactions are \ncharacterized by large amounts of money—multimillions of dollars; the parties are sophisticated \nbusinesses or financial institutions; funds transfers are completed in one day, they are highly efficient \nsubstitutes for paper delivery; they are usually low cost—a few dollars for the funds transfer charged by \nthe sender’s bank. \n \nOperation of Article 4A \nThe UCC “Prefatory Note” to Article 4A observes that “the funds transfer that is covered by Article 4A is \nnot a complex transaction.” To illustrate the operation of Article 4A, assume that Widgets International \nhas an account with First Bank. In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and",

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn.

See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages.

Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address.

This duty arises when the bank provides sufficient information to the customer. The underlying policy decision behind this provision is to promote certainty and predictability in commercial transactions by allocating responsibility among the parties according to who is best able to prevent a loss. As the customer is more familiar with their own signature, they can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial institution which processes thousands of transactions daily."

These statements included either the cancelled checks themselves or copies of the checks relating to the period of each statement. The evidence showed that all bank statements and cancelled checks were sent via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at their designated address each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary, confirming that the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers. Additionally, the court noted that the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in providing the necessary information to a customer when it 'sends...to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items,' without the need for the customer to have 'received' the statement. Therefore, even if Rogers claimed she never received the statements, her duty to inspect and report arose upon the bank's sending of the statements to her address."

Procedural Posture \nPlaintiff, Commerce Bank/Delaware North America (“Commerce”) initially filed a civil complaint against \ndefendant Natasha J. Brown (“Brown”) on October 28, 2005. Commerce seeks judgment in the amount of \n$4.020.11 plus costs and interest and alleges that Brown maintained a checking account with Commerce \nand has been unjustly enriched by $4,020.11.… \n \nThe defendant, Brown…denied all allegations of the complaint. As an affirmative defense Brown claims \nthe transaction for which plaintiff seeks to recover a money judgment were made by means of an ATM \nMachine using a debit card issued by the defendant. On January 16, 2005 Brown asserts that she became \naware of the fraudulent transactions and timely informed the plaintiff of the facts on January 16, 2005. \nBrown asserts that she also requested Commerce in her answer to investigate the matter and to close her \naccount. Based upon these facts, Brown asserts a maximum liability on her own part from $50.00 to \n$500.00 in accordance with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) 15 U.S.C. § 1693(g) and regulation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n976 \n(e), 12 CFR 205.6. [Commerce Bank withdrew its complaint at trial, leaving only the defendant’s counter-\nclaim in issue.] \n \nDefendant Brown asserts [that] defendant failed to investigate and violated EFTA and is therefore liable \nto the plaintiff for money damages citing [EFTA]. \n \nII. The Facts \nBrown was the only witness called at trial. Brown is twenty-seven years old and has been employed by \nWilmington Trust as an Administrative Assistant for the past three years. Brown previously opened a \nchecking account with Commerce and was issued a debit/ATM card by Commerce which was in her \npossession in December 2004. Brown, on or about January 14, 2005 went to Commerce to charge a $5.00 \ndebit to the card at her lunch-break was informed that there was a deficiency balance in the checking \naccount. Brown went to the Talleyville branch of Commerce Bank and spoke with “Carla” who agreed to \ninvestigate these unauthorized charges, as well as honor her request to close the account. Defendant’s \nExhibit No.: 1 is a Commerce Bank electronic filing and/or e-mail which details a visit by defendant on \nJanuary 16, 2005 to report her card loss. The “Description of Claim” indicates as follows: \n \nCustomer came into speak with a CSR “Carla Bernard” on January 16, 2005 to report her card \nloss. At this time her account was only showing a negative $50.00 balance. She told Ms. Bernard \nthat this was not her transaction and to please close this account. Ms. Bernard said that she \nwould do this and that there would be an investigation on the unauthorized transactions. It was \nat this time also that she had Ms. Bernard change her address.

The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are \nvalued at $25,000 or less and the lease is for four months or more.

This amends the TILA by \nrequiring credit card issuers to disclose in a uniform manner the annual percentage rate, annual fees, \ngrace period, and other information on credit card applications. \n \nCredit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 \nThe 1989 act did make it possible for consumers to know the costs associated with credit card use, but the \ncard companies’ behavior over 20 years convinced Congress that more regulation was required. In 2009, \nCongress passed and President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act). It is a further amendment of the TILA. Some of the salient \nparts of the act are as follows: \n \n• \nRestricts all interest rate increases during the first year, with some exceptions. The purpose is to \nabolish “teaser” rates. \n• \nIncreases notice for rate increase on future purchases to 45 days. \n• \nPreserves the ability to pay off on the old terms, with some exceptions. \n• \nLimits fees and penalty interest and requires statements to clearly state the required due date and \nlate payment penalty. \n• \nRequires fair application of payments. Amounts in excess of the minimum payment must be \napplied to the highest interest rate (with some exceptions). \n• \nProvides sensible due dates and time to pay. \n• \nProtects young consumers. Before issuing a card to a person under the age of twenty-one, the card \nissuer must obtain an application that contains either the signature of a cosigner over the age of \ntwenty-one or information indicating an independent means of repaying any credit extended. \n• \nRestricts card issuers from providing tangible gifts to students on college campuses in exchange \nfor filling out a credit card application. \n• \nRequires colleges to publicly disclose any marketing contracts made with a card issuer. \n• \nRequires enhanced disclosures. \n• \nRequires issuers to disclose the period of time and the total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if only minimum monthly payments are made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n992 \n• \nEstablishes gift card protections. [1] \n \nThe Federal Reserve Board is to issue implementing rules. \n \nCreditors who violate the TILA are subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. Of these, the most \nimportant are the civil remedies open to consumers. If a creditor fails to disclose the required \ninformation, a customer may sue to recover twice the finance charge, plus court costs and reasonable \nattorneys’ fees, with some limitations. As to the Credit Card Act of 2009, the issuing companies were not \nhappy with the reforms. Before the law went into effect, the companies—as one commentator put it—\nunleashed a “frenzy of retaliation,” [2]by repricing customer accounts, changing fixed rates to variable \nrates, lowering credit limits, and increasing fees. \n \nState Credit Disclosure Laws \nThe federal TILA is not the only statute dealing with credit disclosures. A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated",

Because \ncredit is such a big business, a number of support industries have grown up around it. One of the most \nimportant is the credit-reporting industry, which addresses this issue of checking creditworthiness. \nCertain companies—credit bureaus—collect information about borrowers, holders of credit cards, store \naccounts, and installment purchasers. For a fee, this information—currently held on tens of millions of \nAmericans—is sold to companies anxious to know whether applicants are creditworthy. If the information \nis inaccurate, it can lead to rejection of a credit application that should be approved, and it can wind up in \nother files where it can live to do more damage. In 1970, Congress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to give consumers access to their credit files in order \nto correct errors. \n \nUnder this statute, an applicant denied credit has the right to be told the name and address of the credit \nbureau (called “consumer reporting agency” in the act) that prepared the report on which the denial was \nbased. (The law covers reports used to screen insurance and job applicants as well as to determine \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n995 \ncreditworthiness.) The agency must list the nature and substance of the information (except medical \ninformation) and its sources (unless they contributed to an investigative-type report). A credit report lists \nsuch information as name, address, employer, salary history, loans outstanding, and the like. An \ninvestigative-type report is one that results from personal interviews and may contain nonfinancial \ninformation, like drinking and other personal habits, character, or participation in dangerous sports. \nSince the investigators rely on talks with neighbors and coworkers, their reports are usually subjective and \ncan often be misleading and inaccurate. \n \nThe agency must furnish the consumer the information free if requested within thirty days of rejection \nand must also specify the name and address of anyone who has received the report within the preceding \nsix months (two years if furnished for employment purposes). \n \nIf the information turns out to be inaccurate, the agency must correct its records; if investigative material \ncannot be verified, it must be removed from the file. Those to whom it was distributed must be notified of \nthe changes. When the agency and the consumer disagree about the validity of the information, the \nconsumer’s version must be placed in the file and included in future distributions of the report. After \nseven years, any adverse information must be removed (ten years in the case of bankruptcy). A person is \nentitled to one free copy of his or her credit report from each of the three main national credit bureaus \nevery twelve months. If a reporting agency fails to correct inaccurate information in a reasonable time, it \nis liable to the consumer for $1,000 plus attorneys’ fees. \n \nUnder the FCRA, any person who obtains information from a credit agency under false pretenses is \nsubject to criminal and civil penalties. The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. See Rodgers \nv. McCullough inSection 24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving use of information from a credit report. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCredit is an important part of the US economy, and there are various laws regulating its availability and \ndisclosure. Usury laws prohibit charging excessive interest rates, though the laws are riddled with exceptions. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n996 \nThe disclosure of credit costs is regulated by the Truth in Lending Act of 1969, the Consumer Leasing Act of \n1988, the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act of 1989, and the Credit Card Accountability, \nResponsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 (these latter three are amendments to the TILA). Some states have \nadopted the Uniform Consumer Credit Code as well. Two major laws prohibit invidious discrimination in the \ngranting of credit: the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975 \n(addressing the problem of redlining).

That is, the Bank may \ntreat, for credit purposes, a woman who dresses like a man differently than a man who dresses like a \nwoman. If so, the Bank concedes, Rosa may have a claim. Indeed, under Price Waterhouse, “stereotyped \nremarks [including statements about dressing more ‘femininely’] can certainly be evidence that gender \nplayed a part.” [Citation.] It is also reasonable to infer, though, that Brunelle refused to give Rosa the loan \napplication because she thought he was gay, confusing sexual orientation with cross-dressing.

It is \nreasonable to infer, as well, that Brunelle simply could not ascertain whether the person shown in the \nidentification card photographs was the same person that appeared before her that day.

Could the bank have denied Mr. Rosa a loan because he was gay? \n2. If a woman had applied for loan materials dressed in traditionally masculine attire, could the bank have \ndenied her the materials? \n3. The Court offers up at least three possible reasons why Rosa was denied the loan application.

To what federal law does the court look in interpreting the application of the ECOA? \n5.

McCullough \n296 F.Supp.2d 895 (W.D. Tenn. 2003) \n \nBackground \nThis case concerns Defendants’ receipt and use of Christine Rodgers’ consumer report. The material facts \ndo not seem to be disputed. The parties agree that Ms. Rodgers gave birth to a daughter, Meghan, on May \n4, 2001. Meghan’s father is Raymond Anthony. Barbara McCullough, an attorney, represented Mr. \nAnthony in a child custody suit against Ms. Rodgers in which Mr. Anthony sought to obtain custody and \nchild support from Ms. Rodgers. Ms. McCullough received, reviewed, and used Ms. Rodgers’ consumer \nreport in connection with the child custody case. \n \nOn September 25, 2001, Ms. McCullough instructed Gloria Christian, her secretary, to obtain Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report. Ms. McCullough received the report on September 27 or 28 of 2001. She \nreviewed the report in preparation for her examination of Ms. Rodgers during a hearing to be held in \njuvenile court on October 23, 2001. She also used the report during the hearing, including attempting to \nmove the document into evidence and possibly handing it to the presiding judge. \n \nThe dispute in this case centers around whether Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms. Rodgers’ \nconsumer report for a purpose permitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”). Plaintiff \ncontends that Ms. McCullough, as well as her law firm, Wilkes, McCullough & Wagner, a partnership, and \nher partners, Calvin J. McCullough and John C. Wagner, are liable for the unlawful receipt and use of Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report in violation 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 o(negligent failure to comply with the FCRA) and \n1681n (willful failure to comply with the FCRA or obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses). \nPlaintiff has also sued Defendants for the state law tort of unlawful invasion of privacy.… \n \nAnalysis \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1010 \nPlaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the questions of whether Defendants failed to comply with \nthe FCRA (i.e. whether Defendants had a permissible purpose to obtain Ms. Rodgers’ credit report), \nwhether Defendants’ alleged failure to comply was willful, and whether Defendants’ actions constituted \nunlawful invasion of privacy. The Court will address the FCRA claims followed by the state law claim for \nunlawful invasion of privacy. \n \nA. Permissible Purpose under the FCRA \nPursuant to the FCRA, “A person shall not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose unless (1) the \nconsumer report is obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished \nunder this section.…” [Citation.] Defendants do not dispute that Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms.",

In the next chapter, we \nlook at mortgages and nonconsensual liens. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1020 \n \nBasics of Secured Transactions \nThe law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can \nbe the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of \nthe security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that \nis, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) \nthe rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key \nterminology, we examine each of these components in turn. \nHere is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, \nsigns a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s \ndefault, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it. Figure 25.1 \n\"The Grasping Hand\" illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but \nthe hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults. \n \nFigure 25.1 The Grasping Hand \n \n \nSource of Law and Definitions \nSource of Law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1021 \nArticle 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property. The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods. Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on \ncredit at your college bookstore. The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1022 \nback a PMSI. In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book.",

Security obtained through agreement comes in three major types: personal property security, suretyship, and mortgage of real estate. On the other hand, security obtained through operation of law is known as a lien, which is a legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or discharge an obligation. The key difference between these two methods lies in their origin: agreements are made voluntarily by the parties involved, whereas liens arise automatically under the law without explicit consent from the debtor."

An example of a situation where a PMSI might be established is when a debtor wants to buy a big hardbound textbook on credit at a college bookstore. The manager may refuse to extend credit outright but agree to take a PMSI, meaning she retains a security interest in the book itself. If the debtor fails to pay, the book can be repossessed. Another example could be a borrower taking out a loan to purchase a car and giving the lender a security interest in the car, which would also qualify as a PMSI."

In Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\", ”Attachment” is the outreached hand \nthat is prepared, if the debtor defaults, to grasp the collateral. [21] \n \nRequirements for Attachment \nThere are three requirements for attachment: (1) the secured party gives value; (2) the debtor has rights in \nthe collateral or the power to transfer rights in it to the secured party; (3) the parties have a security \nagreement “authenticated” (signed) by the debtor, or the creditor has possession of the collateral. \n \n \n \nCreditor Gives Value \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1030 \nThe creditor, or secured party, must give “value” for the security interest to attach. The UCC, in Section 1-\n204, provides that \n \na person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them \n \n(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately \navailable credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in \nthe event of difficulties in collection; or \n \n(2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or \n \n(3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or \n \n(4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. \n \nSuppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000. She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a \nsecurity interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay. \nThat is sufficient value. \n \nDebtor’s Rights in Collateral \nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral. Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it). The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they \nmust be rights that can be conveyed. [22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own. \n \nSecurity Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor \nThe debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract. The UCC says that “the debtor \n[must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” \n“Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic \ncommercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1031 \nrecord…with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a \nrecord.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information \nelectronically stored or on paper. [23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common",

Additionally, the creditor can provide value by securing or satisfying a pre-existing claim, accepting delivery under a pre-existing contract for purchase, or providing any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.

Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000. Bank says, “Okay, Mr. Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation \nmoney, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the \ndebt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no \nagreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety \nwithout the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1055 \nA guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, \ntherefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much \ninterchangeably. But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

                    "question": "What are the differences between a surety and a guarantor, and how do they function in commercial transactions?",
                    "answer": "In commercial transactions, a surety and a guarantor both guarantee an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, the terms 'surety' and 'guarantor' are often used interchangeably. However, there are subtle differences in their roles and the nature of their agreements. A surety is typically a party to the original contract and signs her (or his, or its) name to the agreement alongside the principal debtor. She is bound by the contract from the start and is expected to be aware of the principal debtor's default. Conversely, a guarantor usually enters into a separate agreement with the creditor after the principal debtor has already signed the primary contract. This separate agreement requires additional consideration and binds the guarantor only if the principal debtor defaults. In such cases, the guarantor can claim discharge from liability if the creditor fails to inform him of the principal debtor's default, provided this failure prejudices him. Therefore, while both ensure that obligations are met, the specific terms and conditions under which they operate can differ significantly."

The general principles of contract law apply to suretyship. \nThus a person with the general capacity to contract has the power to become a surety. Consideration is \nrequired for a suretyship contract: if Debtor asks a friend to act as a surety to induce Creditor to make \nDebtor a loan, the consideration Debtor gives Creditor also acts as the consideration Friend gives. Where \nthe suretyship arises after Creditor has already extended credit, new consideration would be required \n(absent application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel [1]). You may recall from the chapters on \ncontracts that the promise by one person to pay or perform for the debts or defaults of another must be \nevidenced by a writing under the statute of frauds (subject to the “main purpose” exception). \n \nSuretyship contracts are affected to some extent by government regulation. Under a 1985 Federal Trade \nCommission Credit Practices Rule, creditors are prohibited from misrepresenting a surety’s liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1057 \nCreditors must also give the surety a notice that explains the nature of the obligation and the potential \nliability that can arise if a person cosigns on another’s debt. [2] \n \nDuties and Rights of the Surety \nDuties of the Surety \nUpon the principal debtor’s default, the surety is contractually obligated to perform unless the principal \nherself or someone on her behalf discharges the obligation. When the surety performs, it must do so in \ngood faith. Because the principal debtor’s defenses are generally limited, and because—as will be noted—\nthe surety has the right to be reimbursed by the debtor, debtors not infrequently claim the surety acted in \nbad faith by doing things like failing to make an adequate investigation (to determine if the debtor really \ndefaulted), overpaying claims, interfering with the contact between the surety and the debtor, and making \nunreasonable refusals to let the debtor complete the project. The case Fidelity and Deposit Co. of \nMaryland v. Douglas Asphalt Co.,in Section 25.5 \"Cases\", is typical. \n \nRights of the Surety \nThe surety has four main rights stemming from its obligation to answer for the debt or default of the \nprincipal debtor. \n \n \n \nExoneration \nIf, at the time a surety’s obligation has matured, the principal can satisfy the obligation but refuses to do \nso, the surety is entitled to exoneration—a court order requiring the principal to perform. It would be \ninequitable to force the surety to perform and then to have to seek reimbursement from the principal if \nall along the principal is able to perform. \n \nReimbursement \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1058 \nIf the surety must pay the creditor because the principal has defaulted, the principal is obligated to \nreimburse the surety. The amount required to be reimbursed includes the surety’s reasonable, good-faith \noutlays, including interest and legal fees. \n \nSubrogation \nSuppose the principal’s duty to the creditor is fully satisfied and that the surety has contributed to this \nsatisfaction. Then the surety is entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor against the principal. \nIn other words, the surety stands in the creditor’s shoes and may assert against the principal whatever \nrights the creditor could have asserted had the duty not been discharged. The right \nof subrogation includes the right to take secured interests that the creditor obtained from the principal \nto cover the duty. Sarah’s Pizzeria owes Martha $5,000, and Martha has taken a security interest in \nSarah’s Chevrolet. Eva is surety for the debt. Sarah defaults, and Eva pays Martha the $5,000. Eva is \nentitled to have the security interest in the car transferred to her. \n \nContribution \nTwo or more sureties who are bound to answer for the principal’s default and who should share between \nthem the loss caused by the default are known as cosureties. A surety who in performing its own \nobligation to the creditor winds up paying more than its proportionate share is entitled to contribution \nfrom the cosureties. \n \n \n \nDefenses of the Parties \nThe principal and the surety may have defenses to paying. \n \nDefenses of the Principal",

The classes of tangible goods are distinguished \nby the primary use intended. Under [the UCC] the four classes [include] “consumer goods,” “equipment,” \n“farm products” and “inventory.” \n \nThe difficulty is that the code provisions use terms arising in commercial circles which have different \nsemantical values from legal precedents. Does the fact that the purchaser bought the goods as a special \ngift to another person signify that it was not for his own “personal, family or household purposes”? The \ntrustee urges that these special facts control under the express provisions of the commercial code. \n \nBy a process of exclusion, a diamond engagement ring purchased for one’s fiancée is not “equipment” \nbought or used in business, “farm products” used in farming operations, or “inventory” held for sale, lease \nor service contracts. When the [debtor] purchased the ring, therefore, it could only have been “consumer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1064 \ngoods” bought “primarily for personal use.” There could be no judicial purpose to create a special class of \nproperty in derogation of the statutory principles. \n \nAnother problem is implicit, although not covered by the briefs. \n \nBy the foregoing summary analysis, it is apparent that the diamond ring, when the interest of the debtor \nattached, was consumer goods since it could have been no other class of goods. Unless the fiancée had a \nspecial status under the code provision protecting a bona fide buyer, without knowledge, for value, of \nconsumer goods, the failure to file a financing statement is not crucial. No evidence has been adduced \npertinent to the scienter question. \n \nIs a promise, as valid contractual consideration, included under the term “value”? In other words, was the \nring given to his betrothed in consideration of marriage (promise for a promise)? If so, and “value” has \nbeen given, the transferee is a “buyer” under traditional concepts. \nThe Uniform Commercial Code definition of “value”…very definitely covers a promise for a promise. The \ndefinition reads that “a person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them…generally in return for any \nconsideration sufficient to support a simple contract.” \n \nIt would seem unrealistic, nevertheless, to apply contract law concepts historically developed into the law \nof marriage relations in the context of new concepts developed for uniform commercial practices. They \nare not, in reality, the same juristic manifold. The purpose of uniformity of the code should not be \ndefeated by the obsessions of the code drafters to be all inclusive for secured creditors. \n \nEven if the trustee, in behalf of the unsecured creditors, would feel inclined to insert love, romance and \nmorals into commercial law, he is appearing in the wrong era, and possibly the wrong court. \n \nOrdered, that the Rike-Kumler Company holds a perfected security interest in the diamond engagement \nring, and the security interest attached to the proceeds realized from the sale of the goods by the trustee in \nbankruptcy. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1065 \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

[Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the \nplaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession. So long as the \nentry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, \nbuildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his \nproperty.” \n \n…[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking \ninto the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other \nbarriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1069 \nDavenport v.

Furthermore, the plaintiff failed to provide specific details on how the contract violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud Statute, which is a prerequisite for claiming unconscionability. As for whether breaking into the garage would be considered unconscionable under UCC Article 2A, the section allows for relief if a lease contract is induced by unconscionable conduct or if unconscionable conduct occurs in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract. However, the specific facts of the case, including the lack of evidence of Ford's involvement and the failure to specify how the contract violated the statute, do not support a finding of unconscionability. Therefore, the court's decision not to find unconscionability was justified based on the provided information."

Douglas Asphalt Co. \n338 Fed.Appx. 886, 11th Cir. Ct. (2009) \n \nPer Curium: [1] \nThe Georgia Department of Transportation (“GDOT”) contracted with Douglas Asphalt Company to \nperform work on an interstate highway. After Douglas Asphalt allegedly failed to pay its suppliers and \nsubcontractors and failed to perform under the contract, GDOT defaulted and terminated Douglas \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1072 \nAsphalt. Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland and Zurich American Insurance Company had \nexecuted payment and performance bonds in connection with Douglas Asphalt’s work on the interstate, \nand after Douglas Asphalt’s default, Fidelity and Zurich spent $15,424,798 remedying the default. \n \nFidelity and Zurich, seeking to recover their losses related to their remedy of the default, brought this suit \nagainst Douglas Asphalt, Joel Spivey, and Ronnie Spivey. The Spiveys and Douglas Asphalt had executed \na General Indemnity Agreement in favor of Fidelity and Zurich. [2] \nAfter a bench trial, the district court entered judgment in favor of Fidelity and Zurich for $16,524,798. \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys now appeal. \n \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of \nFidelity and Zurich because Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith in three ways. \n \nFirst, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that the district court erred in not finding that Fidelity and \nZurich acted in bad faith because they claimed excessive costs to remedy the default. Specifically, Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys argue that they introduced evidence that the interstate project was 98% complete, \nand that only approximately $3.6 million was needed to remedy any default. But, the district court found \nthat the interstate project was only 90%–92% complete and that approximately $2 million needed to be \nspent to correct defective work already done by Douglas Asphalt. Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys have \nnot shown that the district court’s finding was clearly erroneous, and accordingly, their argument that \nFidelity and Zurich showed bad faith in claiming that the project was only 90% complete and therefore \nrequired over $15 million to remedy the default fails. \n \nSecond, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich acted in bad faith by failing to \ncontest the default. However, the district court concluded that the indemnity agreement required Douglas \nAsphalt and the Spiveys to request a contest of the default, and to post collateral security to pay any \njudgment rendered in the course of contesting the default. The court’s finding that Douglas Asphalt and \nthe Spiveys made no such request and posted no collateral security was not clearly erroneous, and the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1073 \nsureties had no independent duty to investigate a default. Accordingly, Fidelity and Zurich’s failure to \ncontest the default does not show bad faith. \n \nFinally, Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys argue that Fidelity and Zurich’s refusal to permit them to remain \ninvolved with the interstate project, either as a contractor or consultant, was evidence of bad faith. Yet, \nDouglas Asphalt and the Spiveys did not direct the district court or this court to any case law that holds \nthat the refusal to permit a defaulting contractor to continue working on a project is bad faith. As the \ndistrict court concluded, Fidelity and Zurich had a contractual right to take possession of all the work \nunder the contract and arrange for its completion. Fidelity and Zurich exercised that contractual right, \nand, as the district court noted, the exercise of a contractual right is not evidence of bad faith. \n \nFinding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why were Douglas Asphalt and the Spiveys supposed to pay the sureties nearly $15.5 million? \n2. What did the plaintiffs claim the defendant sureties did wrong as relates to how much money they spent to \ncure the default? \n3. What is a “contest of the default”? \n4. Why would the sureties probably not want the principal involved in the project? \n \n  \n \n[1] Latin for “by the court.” A decision of an appeals court as a whole in which no judge is identified as the specific \nauthor. \n[2] They promised to reimburse the surety for its expenses and hold it harmless for further liability. \n \n \n \n25.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org",

Should the borrower have misplaced the canceled notes or failed to keep good records, \nhe will need to procure a surety bond to protect the trustee in case of a mistake. This can be an expensive \nprocedure. In many jurisdictions, the mortgage holder is prohibited from seeking a deficiency judgment if \nthe holder chooses to sell the property through nonjudicial means. \n \nAlpha Imperial Building, LLC v. Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, Section 26.4 \"Cases\", discusses \nseveral issues involving deeds of trust. \n \nInstallment or Land Contract \nUnder the installment contract or land contract, the purchaser takes possession and agrees to pay \nthe seller over a period of years. Until the final payment, title belongs to the seller. The contract will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1093 \nspecify the type of deed to be conveyed at closing, the terms of payment, the buyer’s duty to pay taxes and \ninsure the premises, and the seller’s right to accelerate on default. The buyer’s particular concern in this \ntype of sale is whether the seller in fact has title. The buyers can protect themselves by requiring proof of \ntitle and title insurance when the contract is signed. Moreover, the buyer should record the installment \ncontract to protect against the seller’s attempt to convey title to an innocent third-party purchaser while \nthe contract is in effect. \n \nThe benefit to the land contract is that the borrower need not bank-qualify, so the pool of available buyers \nis larger, and buyers who have inadequate resources at the time of contracting but who have the \nexpectation of a rising income in the future are good candidates for the land contract. Also, the seller gets \nall the interest paid by the buyer, instead of the bank getting it in the usual mortgage. The obvious \ndisadvantage from the seller’s point is that she will not get a big lump sum immediately: the payments \ntrickle in over years (unless she can sell the contract to a third party, but that would be at a discount). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe general rule on priority in real property security is that the first creditor to record its interest prevails over \nsubsequent creditors. There are some exceptions; the most familiar is that the seller of a fixture on a \npurchase-money security interest has priority over a previously recorded mortgagee. The mortgage will \nterminate by payment, assumption by a new buyer (with a novation releasing the old buyer), and foreclosure. \nIn a judicial-sale foreclosure, a court authorizes the property’s sale; in a power-of-sale foreclosure, no court \napproval is required. In most states, the mortgagor whose property was foreclosed is given some period of \ntime—six months or a year—to redeem the property; otherwise, the sale is done, but the debtor may be liable \nfor the deficiency, if any. The deed of trust avoids any judicial involvement by having the borrower convey the \nland to a disinterested trustee for the benefit of the lender; the trustee sells it upon default, with the \nproceeds (after expenses) going to the lender. Another method of real property security is a land contract: \ntitle shifts to the buyer only at the end of the term of payments. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1094 \n \n1.

In most states, the mechanic’s lien is given priority not from the date when the lien is recorded \nbut from an earlier date—either the date the contractor was hired or the date construction began. Thus a \npurchaser or lender might lose priority to a creditor with a mechanic’s lien who filed after the sale or \nmortgage. A practical solution to this problem is to hold back part of the funds (purchase price or loan) or \nplace them in escrow until the period for recording liens has expired. \n \nPossessory Lien \nThe most common nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate) is the possessory lien. \nThis is the right to continue to keep the goods on which work has been performed or for which materials \nhave been supplied until the owner pays for the labor or materials. The possessory lien arises both under \ncommon law and under a variety of statutes. Because it is nonconsensual, the possessory lien is not \ncovered by Article 9 of the UCC, which is restricted to consensual security interests. Nor is it governed by \nthe law of mechanic’s liens, which are nonpossessory and relate only to work done to improve real \nproperty. \n \nThe common-law rule is that anyone who, under an express or implied contract, adds value to another’s \nchattel (personal property) by labor, skill, or materials has a possessory lien for the value of the services. \nMoreover, the lienholder may keep the chattel until her services are paid. For example, the dry cleaner \nshop is not going to release the wool jacket that you took in for cleaning unless you make satisfactory \narrangements to pay for it, and the chain saw store won’t let you take the chain saw that you brought in \nfor a tune-up until you pay for the labor and materials for the tune-up. \n \nTax Lien \nAn important statutory lien is the federal tax lien. Once the government assesses a tax, the amount due \nconstitutes a lien on the owner’s property, whether real or personal. Until it is filed in the appropriate \nstate office, others take priority, including purchasers, mechanics’ lienors, judgment lien creditors, and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1098 \nholders of security interests. But once filed, the tax lien takes priority over all subsequently arising liens. \nFederal law exempts some property from the tax lien; for example, unemployment benefits, books and \ntools of a trade, workers’ compensation, judgments for support of minor children, minimum amounts of \nwages and salary, personal effects, furniture, fuel, and provisions are exempt. \n \nLocal governments also can assess liens against real estate for failure to pay real estate taxes. After some \nperiod of time, the real estate may be sold to satisfy the tax amounts owing. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are four types of nonconsensual liens: (1) court-decreed liens are attachment liens, which prevent a \nperson from disposing of assets pending a lawsuit, and judgment liens, which allow the prevailing party in a \nlawsuit to take property belonging to the debtor to satisfy the judgment; (2) mechanics’ liens are authorized \nby statute, giving a person who has provided labor or material to a landowner the right to sell the property to \nget paid; (3) possessory liens on personal property allow one in possession of goods to keep them to satisfy a \nclaim for work done or storage of them; and (4) tax liens are enforced by the government to satisfy \noutstanding tax liabilities and may be assessed against real or personal property. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The mortgagor’s interests are protected in a judicial foreclosure by a court’s oversight of the process; how \nis the mortgagor’s interest protected when a deed of trust is used? \n2. Why is the deed of trust becoming increasingly popular? \n3. What is the rationale for the common-law possessory lien? \n4.

                    "answer": "The key difference between a possessory lien and a mechanic’s lien lies in their application to different types of property and the nature of the lien itself. A possessory lien is a nonconsensual lien on personal property (not real estate), allowing a lienholder to retain possession of goods until payment is made for labor or materials provided. This type of lien arises under common law and various statutes and is not covered by Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which deals with consensual security interests. On the other hand, a mechanic’s lien is a statutory lien that allows a person who has provided labor or materials to a landowner to sell the property to get paid. This lien is specific to real property and is enforced to improve real estate. Therefore, while a possessory lien affects personal property and is based on the performance of work or provision of materials, a mechanic’s lien targets real estate and is designed to ensure payment for services rendered to enhance the property's value. Both types of liens are nonconsensual, meaning they are imposed without the consent of the property owner."

Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent. Additionally, Currin’s statement to [an interested person who",

Secondly, the evidence showed that Currin might have known about Sheth's interest prior to the sale date through a conversation with Sheth's attorney. However, this knowledge did not create an affirmative duty for Currin to offer to re-open the sale. Furthermore, Alpha cited no Washington authority supporting the contention that Currin would have been obligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked. Lastly, the court noted that the decision to continue a sale is within the trustee's discretion, as evidenced by the citation that states, 'the trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, continue the sale.'"

Alpha \nsubmitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an \nestimated 2004 value of $5.2 million. The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million. SFI bought \nthe property for $2.1 million. These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside. \n \nWashington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a \ntrustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone. In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth \nbetween $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873. The Court held that \namount to be grossly inadequate In Steward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for \napproximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870. This court \nheld that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate. In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for \nless than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate. The Court \nin Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase \nprice; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than \nthree percent of the value. In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1116 \nthe sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 \npercent will not be set aside. [Citation.] The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value. \nThese facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price. \n \nAlpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set \naside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here. However, \nthe cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than \nthree and four percent of their value. Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor \nshown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price. \n \nDuty to a Junior Lienholder \nAlpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder. Alpha cites no case law for this \nproposition, and, indeed, there is none—Division Two specifically declined to decide this issue in Country \nExpress [Citation]. Alpha acknowledges the lack of language in RCW 61.24 (the deed of trust statute) \nregarding fiduciary duties of trustees to junior lienholders. But Alpha argues that since RCW 61.24 \nrequires that the trustee follow certain procedures in conducting the sale, and allows for sales to be \nrestrained by anyone with an interest, a substantive duty from the trustee to a junior lienholder can be \ninferred. \n \nAlpha’s arguments are unavailing.

Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the \nparticular debtor—otherwise, one creditor may file an involuntary petition, as long as his claim is for at \nleast $13,475; (3) there must be no bona fide dispute about the debt owing. If there is a dispute, the debtor \ncan resist the involuntary filing, and if she wins the dispute, the creditors who pushed for the involuntary \npetition have to pay the associated costs. Persons owing less than $13,475, farmers, and charitable \norganizations cannot be forced into bankruptcy. \n \nThe Automatic Stay \nThe petition—voluntary or otherwise—operates as a stay against suits or other actions against the debtor \nto recover claims, enforce judgments, or create liens (but not alimony collection). In other words, once the \npetition is filed, the debtor is freed from worry over other proceedings affecting her finances or property. \nNo more debt collection calls! Anyone with a claim, secured or unsecured, must seek relief in the \nbankruptcy court. This provision in the act can have dramatic consequences. Beset by tens of thousands of \nproducts-liability suits for damages caused by asbestos, UNR Industries and Manville Corporation, the \nnation’s largest asbestos producers, filed (separate) voluntary bankruptcy petitions in 1982; those filings \nautomatically stayed all pending lawsuits. \n \nFirst Meeting of Creditors \nOnce a petition in bankruptcy is filed, the court issues an order of relief, which determines that the \ndebtor’s property is subject to bankruptcy court control and creates the stay. The Chapter 7 case may be \ndismissed by the court if, after a notice and hearing, it finds that among other things (e.g., delay, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1130 \nnonpayment of required bankruptcy fees), the debts are primarily consumer debts and the debtor could \npay them off—that’s the 2005 act’s famous “means test,” discussed in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 \nLiquidation\". \n \nAssuming that the order of relief has been properly issued, the creditors must meet within a reasonable \ntime. The debtor is obligated to appear at the meeting and submit to examination under oath. The judge \ndoes not preside and, indeed, is not even entitled to attend the meeting. \n \nWhen the judge issues an order for relief, an interim trustee is appointed who is authorized initially to \ntake control of the debtor’s assets. The trustee is required to collect the property, liquidate the debtor’s \nestate, and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. The trustee may sue and be sued in the name of the \nestate. Under every chapter except Chapter 7, the court has sole discretion to name the trustee. Under \nChapter 7, the creditors may select their own trustee as long as they do it at the first meeting of creditors \nand follow the procedures laid down in the act. \nTrustee’s Powers and Duties \nThe act empowers the trustee to use, sell, or lease the debtor’s property in the ordinary course of business \nor, after notice and a hearing, even if not in the ordinary course of business. In all cases, the trustee must \nprotect any security interests in the property. As long as the court has authorized the debtor’s business to \ncontinue, the trustee may also obtain credit in the ordinary course of business. She may invest money in \nthe estate to yield the maximum, but reasonably safe, return. Subject to the court’s approval, she may \nemploy various professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and appraisers, and may, with some \nexceptions, assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases that the debtor has made. The \ntrustee also has the power to avoid many prebankruptcy transactions in order to recover property of the \ndebtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate.

He must sell the \nproperty for money, close up the estate “as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties \nin interest,” investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, examine proofs of claims, reject improper ones, \noppose the discharge of the debtor where doing so is advisable in the trustee’s opinion, furnish a creditor \nwith information about the estate and his administration (unless the court orders otherwise), file tax \nreports if the business continues to be operated, and make a final report and file it with the court. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1143 \n \nConversion \nUnder Section 706 of the bankruptcy code, the debtor may convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 11, 12, or \n13 at any time. The court may order a conversion to Chapter 11 at any time upon request of a party in \ninterest and after notice and hearing. And, as discussed next, a case may be converted from Chapter 7 to \nChapter 13 if the debtor agrees, or be dismissed if he does not, in those cases where the debtor makes too \nmuch money to be discharged without it being an “abuse” under the 2005 act. \n \nDismissal \nThe court may dismiss a case for three general reasons. \n \nThe first reason is “for cause,” after notice and a hearing for cause, including (1) unreasonable delay by the \ndebtor that prejudices creditors, (2) nonpayment of any fees required, (3) failure to file required \ndocuments and schedules. \n \nThe second reason for dismissal (or, with the debtor’s permission, conversion to Chapter 11 or 13) applies \nto debtors whose debt is primarily consumer debt: the court may—after notice and a hearing—dismiss a \ncase if granting relief would be “an abuse of the provisions” of the bankruptcy code. \nThe third reason for dismissal is really the crux of the 2005 law: under it, the court will find that granting \nrelief under Chapter 7 to a debtor whose debt is primarily consumer debt is “an abuse” if the debtor makes \ntoo much money. The debtor must pass a means test: If he’s poor enough, he can go Chapter 7. If he is not \npoor enough (or if they are not, in case of a married couple), Chapter 13—making payments to creditors—\nis the way to go. Here is one practitioner’s explanation of the means test: \nTo apply the means test, the courts will look at the debtor’s average income for the 6 months prior \nto filing [not the debtor’s income at the time of filing, when—say—she just lost her job] and \ncompare it to the median income for that state. For example, the median annual income for a \nsingle wage-earner in California is $42,012. If the income is below the median, then Chapter 7 \nremains open as an option. If the income exceeds the median, the remaining parts of the means \ntest will be applied. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1144",

                    "question": "What are the specific conditions under which a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case might be dismissed, and how does the 'means test' play a role in determining whether a debtor qualifies for Chapter 7 relief?",
                    "answer": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases can be dismissed for three primary reasons: 'for cause,' 'abuse of provisions,' and 'abuse of the means test.' The 'for cause' dismissal typically involves situations like unreasonable delays by the debtor, non-payment of required fees, or failure to file necessary documents. The 'abuse of provisions' dismissal is applicable to debtors with primarily consumer debt and occurs when granting relief would be considered an abuse of the provisions of the bankruptcy code. This can happen even if the debtor files for Chapter 7. The 'means test' is particularly significant in determining whether a debtor qualifies for Chapter 7 relief, especially for those with higher incomes. Under the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA), the court will evaluate the debtor's average income over the six months preceding the filing against the median income for their state. If the debtor's income exceeds the state's median income, they must pass additional means test criteria, potentially leading to a conversion to Chapter 13 or dismissal of the Chapter 7 case. Thus, the means test acts as a critical threshold for eligibility, ensuring that only debtors who genuinely qualify due to financial hardship are granted Chapter 7 relief."

This list is not exhaustive: \n \n1. The debtor is not an individual. In a Chapter 7 case, a corporation or partnership does not receive a \nbankruptcy discharge; instead, the entity is dissolved and its assets liquidated. The debts remain \ntheoretically valid but uncollectible until the statute of limitations on them has run. Only an \nindividual can receive a Chapter 7 discharge. [3] \n2. The debtor has concealed or destroyed property with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay within twelve \nmonths preceding filing of the petition. \n3. The debtor has concealed, destroyed, or falsified books and records \n4. The debtor has lied under oath, knowingly given a false account, presented or used a false claim, \ngiven or received bribes, refused to obey court orders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1147 \n5. The debtor has failed to explain satisfactorily any loss of assets. \n6. The debtor has declared Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy within eight years, or Chapter 13 within \nsix years (with some exceptions). \n7. The debtor failed to participate in “an instructional course concerning personal financial \nmanagement” (unless that’s excused). \n8. An individual debtor has “abused” the bankruptcy process. A preferential transfer is not an “abuse,” \nbut it will be set aside. Making too much money to file Chapter 7 is “an abuse” that will deny \ndischarge. \n \nA discharge may be revoked if the debtor committed fraud during the bankruptcy proceedings, but the \ntrustee or a creditor must apply for revocation within one year of the discharge. \n \nHaving the discharge denied does not affect the administration of the bankruptcy case. The trustee can \n(and will) continue to liquidate any nonexempt assets of the debtor and pay the creditors, but the debtor \nstill has to pay the debts left over. \nAs to any consequence of discharge, bankruptcy law prohibits governmental units from discriminating \nagainst a person who has gone through bankruptcy. Debtors are also protected from discrimination by \nprivate employers; for example, a private employer may not fire a debtor because of the bankruptcy. \nCertainly, however, the debtor’s credit rating will be affected by the bankruptcy. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy case may be dismissed for cause or because the debtor has abused the system. The \ndebtor is automatically considered to have abused the system if he makes too much money. With the debtor’s \npermission, the Chapter 7 may be converted to Chapter 11, 12, or 13. The law requires that the debtor pass a \nmeans test to qualify for Chapter 7. Assuming the debtor does qualify for Chapter 7, her nonexempt assets (if \nthere are any) are sold by the trustee and distributed to creditors according to a priority set out in the law. A \ndischarge may be denied, in general because the debtor has behaved dishonestly or—again—has abused the \nsystem. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1148 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understand that there are nonbankruptcy alternatives for debtors who cannot pay their bills in a timely \nway: assignment for benefit of creditors, compositions, and receiverships. \n2. Recognize the reasons why these alternatives might not work. \n \n \nAlternatives to Bankruptcy: Overview \nBankruptcy is a necessary thing in a capitalist economic system. As already noted, without it, few people \nwould be willing to take business risks, and the economy would necessarily operate at a lower level \n(something some people might not think so bad overall). But bankruptcy, however “enlightened” society \nmay have become about it since Victorian days, still carries a stigma. Bankruptcy filings are public \ninformation; the lists of people and businesses who declare bankruptcy are regularly published in monthly \nbusiness journals. Bankruptcy is expensive, too, and both debtors and creditors become enmeshed in \nsignificantly complex federal law. For these reasons, among others, both parties frequently determine it is \nin their best interest to find an alternative to bankruptcy. Here we take up briefly three common \nalternatives. \n \nIn other parts of this book, other nonbankruptcy creditors’ rights are discussed: under the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC), creditors have rights to reclaim goods sold and delivered but not paid for; under \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1156 \nthe UCC, too, creditors have a right to repossess personal property that has been put up as collateral for \nthe debtor’s loan or extension of credit; and mortgagees have the right to repossess real estate without \njudicial assistance in many circumstances. These nonbankruptcy remedies are governed mostly by state \nlaw. \n \nThe nonbankruptcy alternatives discussed here are governed by state law also. \n \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors; Compositions; Receivership \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors \nUnder a common-law assignment for the benefit of creditors, the debtor transfers some or all of his \nassets to a trustee—usually someone appointed by the adjustment bureau of a local credit managers’ \nassociation—who sells the assets and apportions the proceeds in some agreed manner, usually pro rata, to \nthe creditors. Of course, not every creditor need agree with such a distribution. Strictly speaking, the \ncommon-law assignment does not discharge the balance of the debt. Many state statutes attempt to \naddress this problem either by prohibiting creditors who accept a partial payment of debt under an \nassignment from claiming the balance or by permitting debtors to demand a release from creditors who \naccept partial payment. \n \nComposition \nA composition is simply an agreement by creditors to accept less than the full amount of the debt and to \ndischarge the debtor from further liability. As a contract, composition requires consideration; the mutual \nagreement among creditors to accept a pro rata share of the proceeds is held to be sufficient consideration \nto support the discharge. The essential difference between assignment and composition lies in the \ncreditors’ agreement: an assignment implies no agreement among the creditors, whereas a composition \ndoes. Not all creditors of the particular debtor need agree to the composition for it to be valid. A creditor \nwho does not agree to the composition remains free to attempt to collect the full sum owed; in particular, \na creditor not inclined to compose the debt could attach the debtor’s assets while other creditors are \nbargaining over the details of the composition agreement. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1157 \nOne advantage of the assignment over the composition is that in the former the debtor’s assets—having",

                    "answer": "Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy versus Chapter 7 involves distinct processes and outcomes. Chapter 7 bankruptcy typically leads to the liquidation of a business's assets to repay creditors, ultimately closing the business. On the other hand, Chapter 11 allows a business to reorganize its debts and continue operations, aiming to develop a plan to pay off debts over a three-to-five year period. This plan must be approved by creditors and the court. Importantly, in Chapter 11, the business retains control over its assets and operations, which can be crucial for maintaining business value and continuity. Additionally, under Chapter 11, certain relief from creditors that may not be available in Chapter 7 can be sought, such as restructuring debt terms or negotiating new financing. This flexibility makes Chapter 11 a more viable option for business owners looking to preserve their enterprise while addressing financial difficulties."

                    "question": "Can you explain the distinction between dischargeable and nondischargeable debts under Chapter 13 bankruptcy, specifically mentioning alimony and child support?",
                    "answer": "Under Chapter 13 bankruptcy, certain types of debts are considered dischargeable, meaning they can be legally forgiven if the debtor successfully completes the repayment plan. However, alimony and child support obligations fall into the category of nondischargeable debts. This means that even if a debtor files for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, they are still legally obligated to fulfill these financial responsibilities. The rationale behind this distinction is rooted in the societal importance of these obligations. Alimony and child support ensure that individuals maintain their legal and moral duties towards their ex-spouses and children, regardless of their current financial status. By making these debts non-dischargeable, the bankruptcy process does not undermine the integrity of family relationships and the welfare of dependents."

            "chunk": "bankruptcy case.… \n \nWhile a debtor’s decision to file an action to determine the dischargeability of a student loan is not \ntemporally constrained, this does not mean that a debtor’s financial hardship may arise after a discharge \nhas been entered. \n \n[The] Coleman [case, cited by debtor] deals with the ripeness of a dispute concerning the dischargeability \nof a student loan. [The Ninth Circuit held that it] is ripe for adjudication at any point during the case. The \nNinth Circuit did not conclude, however, that a debtor could rely upon post-discharge circumstances to \nestablish undue hardship. In fact, the court in Coleman made clear that the debtor could take a snapshot \nof the hardship warranting a discharge of a student loan any time prior to discharge. [Coleman was a \nChapter 13 case.] \n \nHere, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident on January 17, 2007, almost exactly one year after \nher January 3, 2006 chapter 7 discharge. Because the accident had no causal link to the misfortune \nprompting the debtor to seek bankruptcy relief in the first instance, the accident cannot be relied on to \njustify the discharge of the student loans because repayment would be an undue hardship. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1162 \nTo hold otherwise would mean that a bankruptcy discharge is a perpetual license to discharge student \nloans based on events that occur years after the bankruptcy discharge is granted. If a discharged debtor \nsuffers later financial misfortune, that debtor must consider seeking another discharge subject to the \nlimitations imposed by [the sections of the code stipulating how often a person can petition for \nbankruptcy]. In the context of a second case, the debtor could then ask that the student loan be declared \ndischargeable under section 523(a)(8). \n \nIn this instance, the debtor is now eligible for a discharge in a chapter 13 case. Her chapter 7 petition was \nfiled on September 19, 2005. Section 1328(f)(1) bars a chapter 13 discharge when the debtor has received \na chapter 7 discharge in a case commenced in the prior four years. She would not be eligible for a chapter \n7 discharge until September 19, 2013. \n \nThis is not to say that post-discharge events are irrelevant. The second and third prongs of the Pena test \nrequire the court to consider whether the circumstances preventing a debtor from repaying a student loan \nare likely to persist, and whether the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the student loan. Post-\ndischarge events are relevant to these determinations because they require the court to look into the \ndebtor’s financial future. \n \nUnfortunately for the debtor, it is unnecessary to consider the second and third prongs because she \ncannot satisfy the first prong. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. What is the rationale for making the bankruptcy discharge of student loans very difficult? \n2. Petitioner argued that she should be able to use a postdischarge event (the auto accident) as a basis for \nestablishing that she could not maintain a “minimal” standard of living, and thus she should get a \nretroactive discharge of her student loans. What benefit is there to her if she could successfully make the \nargument, given that she could—as the court noted—file for Chapter 13? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1163 \n3. The court cites the Coleman case. That was a Chapter 13 proceeding. Here were the facts: Debtor had \nnot yet completed her payments under her five-year repayment plan, and no discharge order had yet \nbeen entered; one year into the plan, she was laid off work. She had been trying to repay her student \nloans for several years, and she claimed she would suffer hardship in committing to the five-year \nrepayment plan without any guarantee that her student loan obligations would be discharged, since \nshe was required to commit all of her disposable income to payments under the plan and would likely \nbe forced to pursue undue hardship issue pro se upon completion of the plan.” In Coleman, the court \nheld that Debtor could, postfiling but predischarge—one year into the five-year plan—bring up the \nhardship issue. \nNow, in the case here, after the auto accident, the petitioner “subsists” on Social Security disability \npayments, and she has almost $150,000 in debt, yet the court prohibited her from claiming a hardship \ndischarge of student loans. Does this result really make sense? Is the court’s concern that allowing this \npostdischarge relief would mean “that a bankruptcy discharge is a perpetual license to discharge \nstudent loans based on events that occur years after the bankruptcy discharge is granted” well \nfounded? Suppose it is scheduled to take thirty years to pay off student loans; in year 4, the student-\nborrower, now Debtor, declares Chapter 7 bankruptcy, student loans not being discharged; in year 6, \nthe person is rendered disabled. What public policy is offended if the person is allowed to “reopen” \nthe bankruptcy and use the postbankruptcy event as a basis for claiming a hardship discharge of \nstudent loans?",

While a debtor’s decision to file an action to determine the dischargeability of a student loan is not temporally constrained, the court has ruled that a debtor cannot rely on post-discharge circumstances to establish undue hardship. This means that a debtor must demonstrate hardship prior to discharge. Post-discharge events are only relevant for determining whether the circumstances preventing repayment are likely to persist and whether the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loan. Allowing post-discharge events to be used as a basis for establishing undue hardship could undermine the purpose of bankruptcy discharge and create a perpetual license to discharge student loans based on events that occur years after the bankruptcy discharge is granted.

The court held that the debtor could bring up the hardship issue post-filing but predischarge. However, in the current case, the debtor's injury occurred after a Chapter 7 discharge and was unrelated to the original misfortune prompting the bankruptcy filing. The court found that the injury could not be relied upon to justify the discharge of student loans because repayment would still be an undue hardship. This decision is consistent with the principle that post-discharge events cannot be used to establish undue hardship for discharging student loans. The court emphasized that allowing such post-discharge relief would create a perpetual license to discharge student loans based on events occurring years after the discharge, which would undermine the integrity of the bankruptcy system."

The current law is the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which provides for six types of proceedings: (1) \nliquidation, Chapter 7; (2) adjustment of debts of a municipality, Chapter 9; (3) reorganization, Chapter \n11; (4) family farmers with regular income, Chapter 12; (5) individuals with regular income, Chapter 13; \nand (6) cross-border bankruptcies, Chapter 15. \n \nWith some exceptions, any individual, partnership, or corporation seeking liquidation may file a voluntary \npetition in bankruptcy. An involuntary petition is also possible; creditors petitioning for that must meet \ncertain criteria. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1171 \nA petition operates as a stay against the debtor for lawsuits to recover claims or enforce judgments or \nliens. A judge will issue an order of relief and appoint a trustee, who takes over the debtor’s property and \npreserves security interests. To recover monies owed, creditors must file proof of claims. The trustee has \ncertain powers to recover property for the estate that the debtor transferred before bankruptcy.

                    "answer": "Criminal fines are generally considered part of a debtor's sentence and are typically paid into a special fund for victims' compensation and assistance through the U.S. Treasury. On the other hand, costs of prosecution are expenses incurred by the government to conduct the criminal case, which are often paid to the entity incurring those costs. In the context of Chapter 13 bankruptcy, criminal fines fall under the category of 'restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime,' and thus are not dischargeable. Conversely, costs of prosecution are not explicitly covered by this exception and can potentially be discharged under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy unless specifically excluded by the bankruptcy court."

The costs of prosecution were not explicitly mentioned in this exception. Furthermore, the court emphasized that the principle of construing exceptions to discharge narrowly in favor of debtors, especially in Chapter 13 cases, supported its decision. This interpretation aligns with the legislative intent to provide broader relief to debtors under Chapter 13 compared to Chapter 7, where Congress could have mirrored the exception but chose not to."

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n0\n25\n10\n20\n20\n15\n30\n10\n40\n5\n50\nTable 3.1 Demand\nSchedule for Pizza\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\n68\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 3.2 Demand Curve for Pizzas\nThe inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of a good sold occurs for two reasons.\nFirst, as you consume more and more pizza, the amount of happiness that one more pizza will bring you\ndiminishes. If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher. The\ndemand schedule for pizzas might look like Table 3.2 after an increase in the price of hamburgers.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n9\n25\n19\n20\n29\n15\n39\n10\n49\n5\n59\nTable 3.2 Demand\nSchedule for Pizzas\nafter the Price of\nHamburgers Doubles\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n69\nThis change leads to a movement in the demand curve—outward to the right, as shown in Figure 3.3. This is\nknown as an increase in demand. Now, at a price of $25, people will purchase 19 pizzas instead of 10; and at a\nprice of $15, people will purchase 39 pizzas instead of 30.\nFigure 3.3 An Increase in Demand Represented as a Movement of the Demand Curve to the Right\nA decrease in demand would cause the demand curve to move to the left. This could happen if people’s tastes\nand preferences changed. If there were, for example, increased publicity about pizza being an unhealthy food\nchoice, some individuals would choose healthier alternatives and consume less pizza.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDemand Curve Shifts\nIf any of the items that are assumed not to change when a demand curve is drawn do change, then the\ndemand curve can shift. To learn more about these changes in demand, watch the MRU video on demand\ncurve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video).\nSupply\nSupply is the quantity of a good or service that firms are willing to sell at various prices, during a given time\nperiod, ceteris paribus. Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale. Thus, there is a positive relationship\nbetween the price and quantity supplied.\nPrice ($) Quantity\n30\n60\n25\n50\n20\n40\n15\n30\n10\n20\n5\n10\nTable 3.3 Supply\nSchedule for Pizzas\n70\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates",

                    "answer": "The demand curve represents the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded by consumers at those prices. It is typically downward sloping because as the price of a good decreases, the quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is due to two primary reasons: the law of diminishing marginal utility and the ability to pay. As consumers consume more of a good, the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) gained from consuming each successive unit diminishes, making consumers less willing to pay a high price for additional units. Additionally, as the price falls, more consumers who were previously unable to afford the good become willing and able to purchase it, thus increasing the overall quantity demanded."

                    "answer": "Changes in relevant economic factors can cause the demand curve to shift, leading to either an increase or decrease in demand. For instance, if the price of a related good changes, it can affect the demand for a product. If the price of hamburgers doubles, families might prefer to have pizza nights over hamburger cookouts, thereby increasing the demand for pizzas. Other relevant economic factors that can influence demand include consumer income, the size of the population, and consumer tastes and preferences. For example, if there is increased publicity about pizza being unhealthy, some individuals might opt for healthier alternatives, reducing the demand for pizzas. These changes lead to a shift in the entire demand curve rather than a movement along the existing curve, as they affect the underlying willingness and ability of consumers to purchase the good at different prices."

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n73\nSupply2, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium1\nto Equilibrium2\n. The new equilibrium price will\nbe $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left. In Figure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change\nfrom\nto\n.\nFigure 3.8 A Decrease in Demand\nAt the new equilibrium,\n, the price of a pizza is $10. The new equilibrium quantity is 20 pizzas. Note that the\nsupply curve has not moved.

Show this movement in a graph. What happens to\nthe equilibrium? What are some reasons you can think of that may have caused this change in demand?\nSolution:\nThis is an increase in demand. At every price, consumers now want to purchase more sweatshirts than they\ndid before. This is shown in the graph as a movement of the demand curve outward to the right. Both the\nequilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will rise because of this increase in demand. The equilibrium\nprice will now be $40, and the equilibrium quantity of sweatshirts will be 30. Note that there is not an\nincrease in supply; the supply curve does not move. There is simply an increase in quantity supplied (see\nFigure 3.9).\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n75\nFigure 3.9 Graph Showing Increase in Sweatshirt Supply\nA change in any of the factors that are assumed to be held constant under the ceteris paribus assumption\ncould have caused the demand curve to shift to the right. Perhaps a rise in consumers’ incomes led them to\npurchase more clothing, including sweatshirts. Or an unseasonably cool fall could result in more people\npurchasing sweatshirts. If a popular TV personality indicates that their favorite weekend wardrobe consists\nof jeans and a sweatshirt and the tabloids run pictures of the celebrity wearing sweatshirts, the tastes and\npreferences of consumers may change.

                    "answer": "If the demand for sweatshirts increased according to the new demand schedule in Table 3.5, the demand curve would shift outward to the right. This shift would lead to a new equilibrium where both the equilibrium price and quantity would increase. Specifically, at every price level, consumers would now want to buy more sweatshirts. Given the new demand schedule, the equilibrium price would rise to $40 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to 30 sweatshirts. This scenario reflects an increase in consumer preference for sweatshirts, possibly due to factors such as rising incomes, cooler weather, or celebrity endorsements, which do not affect the supply curve but influence the quantity supplied at each price point."

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle\na period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\nceteris paribus\nholding all other things constant\nconsumer price index (CPI)\na measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\ncore inflation index\na measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\ndemand\nthe quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\ntime period, ceteris paribus\neconomic exposure\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\ncustomers\nequilibrium\nthe point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\nequilibrium price\nthe price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\nexpansion\nthe part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\n3 • Summary\n95\nGDP deflator\na measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, intended to measure what\nGDP would be if prices did not change from one year to the next",

                    "answer": "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a typical urban family of four might purchase. It represents the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The CPI is used to understand the impact of inflation on the cost of living in a country. For instance, the text mentions that the overall price level today is about three times what it was in 1970 in both Japan and Switzerland, indicating significant inflationary pressure over this period. This comparison helps in assessing the relative impact of inflation across different countries and over time."

After\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses. To sell its hunting and fishing equipment in the current year, Clear Lake\nSporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500) and utilities for its retail and warehouse spaces ($2,500);\nrecorded depreciation on equipment, buildings, and store furnishings (shelves, racks, etc.) ($3,600); and paid\nsalaries to its indirect employees in accounting, purchasing, and human resources ($5,400). The company’s\noperating expenses are deducted from gross profit to arrive at operating income\nWhile gross profit reflects only how profitable the firm was in making its core product, operating income\n5.1 • The Income Statement\n131\nreflects how profitable the firm’s daily operations were as a whole. This still does not include other\nmiscellaneous items outside the scope of a firm’s normal business. Just as the name implies, it shows income\nfrom the core operations of the firm.\nFigure 5.3 Income Statement through Income from Operations\nWe can see that the company was able to generate\nmore in net sales in the\ncurrent year than the prior year. However, it only generated\nin gross profit and\nof additional operating income. Further investigation shows that while net sales\nincreased, so did the direct costs of its goods (COGS) and its operating expenses.\nWe will further explore how to assess each of these expenses later in the chapter using common-size analysis.\nCommon-size analysis reflects each element of a financial statement as a percentage of the base. In the case\nof the income statement, the base is net sales.

Have any of the operating expenses changed significantly? How did that impact the company’s\noperating income? What might it tell you about the company’s performance?\nNet Income\nFinally, we move on to net income, or what is commonly referred to as the bottom line. Net income (or loss)\nreflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events\noutside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at\nnet income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are\nthose that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a\npiece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.\nWe can see in Figure 5.4 that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense\n132\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof $2,000 in the current year and $3,000 the prior year.

This improvement in gross profit suggests an increase in profitability from their core product sales. However, when examining operating income, it appears that the increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher operating expenses. For the current year, Clear Lake Sporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500), utilities ($2,500), recorded depreciation ($3,600), and paid salaries to indirect employees ($5,400), totaling $17,000 in operating expenses. These expenses, combined with the increase in direct costs of goods sold (COGS), resulted in only a modest increase in operating income.

If Apple's operating income has improved or declined, it may indicate changes in the company's overall profitability from its core operations. To understand the impact of operating expenses, one should examine whether any specific expenses have changed significantly. A significant increase or decrease in certain expenses relative to others might suggest areas where the company is either becoming more efficient or facing challenges. If the improvement or decline in operating income aligns with trends observed in net sales and gross profit, it could reflect consistent performance over time, where the company is earning more or less gross profit on its gross sales.

This comprises the\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\nsaving and investing.\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples\nwe have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\nall other variables are constant.\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\nrate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period\nand n as the number\nof periods (12 months in a year;\n) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\ntimes a year, would grow to\nin one year. Note that this final amount ends up\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\n218\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompounded future value of $1.061.67, which would appear to make logical sense.\nThe total differences in future values among annual, monthly, and quarterly compounding in these examples\nare insignificant, amounting to less than $1.70 in total. However, when working with larger amounts, higher\ninterest rates, more frequent compounding periods, and longer terms, compounding periods and frequency\nbecome far more important and can generate some exceptionally large differences in future values.\nTen million dollars at 12% growth for one year and compounded annually amounts to\n, while 10 million dollars on the same terms but compounded quarterly will\nproduce\n. Most wealthy and rational investors and savers would be\nvery pleased to earn that additional $55,088.10 by simply having their funds in an account that features\nquarterly compounding.\nIn another example, $200 at 60% interest, compounded annually for six years, becomes\n, while this same amount compounded quarterly grows to\n.\nAn amount of $1 at 3%, compounded annually for 100 years, will be worth\n. The same\ndollar at the same interest rate, compounded monthly over the course of a century, will grow to\n.\nThis would all seem to make sense due to the fact that in situations when compounding increases in\nfrequency, interest income is being received during the year as opposed to at the end of the year and thus\ngrows more rapidly to become a larger and more valuable sum of money. This is important because we know\nthrough the concept of TVM that having money now is more useful to us than having that same amount of\nmoney at some later point in time.\nThe Rule of 72\nThe rule of 72 is a simple and often very useful mathematical shortcut that can help you estimate the impact of\nany interest or growth rate and can be used in situations ranging from financial calculations to projections of\npopulation growth.

                    "answer": "The future value of $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be $1,060.00. This is calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest; P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money); r is the annual interest rate (decimal); n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year; and t is the time the money is invested for in years. In the case of annual compounding, n=1, so the formula simplifies to A = P(1 + r)^t. For the example, A = 1000(1 + 0.06)^1 = $1,060.00. If the same $1,000 is invested for the same period of time—one year—and earning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly, the future value would be $1,061.67. Here, n=12 since interest is compounded 12 times a year. Thus, the formula becomes A = 1000(1 + 0.06/12)^(12*1) = $1,061.67. The monthly compounding results in a slightly higher future value due to the additional interest earned on the previously earned interest, making logical sense given the increased frequency of compounding."

It works by dividing the number 72 by the interest rate or growth rate. For instance, if the interest rate is 6%, the investment will approximately double in 72/6 = 12 years. This rule is particularly useful for quick mental calculations and provides a good approximation for interest rates between 6% and 10%. Its significance lies in illustrating the power of compound interest and exponential growth. By applying the Rule of 72, individuals can grasp how even small interest rates can lead to significant growth over time, emphasizing the importance of early investment and consistent savings.

When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very\neasily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.\nLet’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your\naccount earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will take\nor 8, years to double. However, if you are\nearning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take\n, or 12, years to double.\nNow let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your\nmoney in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.\nIt is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an\namount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.",

                    "question": "How does the rule of 72 help in understanding the impact of different growth rates on an investment's ability to double?",
                    "answer": "The rule of 72 provides a quick and easy way to estimate the time it takes for an investment to double based on its growth rate. For instance, if an investment grows at a rate of 9%, it will take approximately 8 years to double, whereas at a 6% growth rate, it will take around 12 years. This demonstrates that even slight variations in the growth rate can significantly affect the time needed for an investment to double. Additionally, the rule of 72 can be used to determine the necessary growth rate to achieve a desired doubling time. For example, if one needs to double their money in 5 years, they would need an investment with a 14.4% growth rate. This tool is particularly useful for financial estimations and projections, allowing individuals to quickly assess the potential outcomes of various investment scenarios without the need for complex calculations."

                    "answer": "The rule of 72 has numerous applications in economics and population growth. In economic terms, it can be used to estimate how long it will take for a country's gross domestic product (GDP) to double at a given growth rate. For example, if a country's GDP is growing at 4% annually, it will take approximately 18 years for the GDP to double. Similarly, if the growth rate drops to 2%, it will take 36 years, and if it rises to 11%, it will take around 6.55 years. This illustrates how changes in the growth rate can significantly impact economic forecasts and planning. In the context of population growth, the rule of 72 can help predict how quickly a population will double. If a country's population growth rate increases from 2% to 3%, the population will double in 24 years instead of 36 years, highlighting the importance of even small changes in growth rates. Such insights are crucial for urban planning, infrastructure development, and resource allocation."

The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries. Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for\n$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore\ntaxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission\nis offering you instead.\nBy substitution, and following the proper order of operations:\nAll things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119\ntoday. Now you can compare like numbers, and the $787,000 cash lump sum is worth more than the\ndiscounted future payments. That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.",

                    "answer": "An annuity due differs from an ordinary annuity by having payments start immediately rather than waiting for one period. This means that the first payment is made at point zero, and the subsequent payments follow. Because of this immediate payment, the initial investment for an annuity due needs to be larger to account for the loss of compounding power caused by the immediate withdrawal. Thus, the present value of an annuity due is always greater than that of an ordinary annuity, given the same parameters and assuming all other factors remain constant."

The syntax\nfor the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is\n=EFFECT(rate,periods)\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n251\nwhere rate is the nominal rate and periods represents the number of periods within a year.\nEarlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over\n19.56% (see Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7 Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate\nNote several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.\nExcel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization.

Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate\nand periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The\ndollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t\nattempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as an absolute\nreference (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.9 Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table\n3.\nThe next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this\ncase cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference.

No dollar signs are included because this cell reference can adjust to each row into which this\nformula is replicated, as will be seen in the following examples.\nFigure 8.11 Step 4 of Creating an Amortization Table\n5.\nBecause our principal portion of the last payment has reduced our outstanding balance, it is subtracted\nfrom the preceding balance in cell E9 (see Figure 8.12).

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\nYield to Maturity\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM?

If the Coca-Cola bond has just been issued in March 2021, then it would be a seven-year, semiannual\nbond with a coupon rate of 1.0% and an original price of $952.06 at the time of issue (Table 10.5).\nBond Characteristic\nDetails\nPrice (% of par)\n95.20\nCoupon rate\n1%\nMaturity date\nMarch 15, 2028\nStandard & Poor’s Rating\nA+\nCoupon payment frequency Semiannual\nFirst coupon date\nSeptember 1, 2021\nType\nCorporate\nCallable?\nYes\nTable 10.5 Overview of Coca-Cola Bond (as of March\n2021) (credit: FINRA-Markets.Morningstar)\nDetermining Bond Yield Using a Calculator\nFor the Coca-Cola bond above, what was the bond’s YTM at its issue date? This is not an easy problem to solve\nwith a mathematical formula. It is far more practical, not to mention easier, to use a financial calculator or an\nExcel spreadsheet to solve for bond prices, yields, and maturity periods.\nWe will cover Excel applications later, but we can jump into some calculator examples right now. So, to\ncalculate the yield on the Coca-Cola bond, we’ll start by entering the values we have for this bond into a\ncalculator. The values we know are as follows:\nIf the bond’s selling price was $952.06 at issue, we have all the information we need to determine the bond’s\nYTM at issue. Table 10.6 shows the steps for using a calculator to come to an answer.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nClear calculator register\nCE/C\nCE/C\n0.0000\n2\nEnter present value or price as a negative amount 952.06 +|-\n+|- PV\nPV PV =\n-952.0600\nTable 10.6 Calculator Steps for Bond’s Yield to Maturity at Issue\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n293\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n3\nEnter future or par value\n1000 FV\nFV\nFV =\n1,000.0000\n4\nEnter periods\n14 NN\nN =\n14.0000\n5\nEnter coupon payment\n5 PMT\nPMT\nPMT =\n5.0000\n6\nCompute interest rate\nCPT\nCPT I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n0.8651\nTable 10.6 Calculator Steps for Bond’s Yield to Maturity at Issue\nThe calculated I/Y (interest rate or YTM) of 0.8651 is a semiannual figure because the periods and coupon\npayments we entered for the calculation are semiannual values. To covert the semiannual value into an annual\nrate, we will need multiply the calculated I/Y by 2. This gives us an amount of 1.73%.\nSo, the YTM of the Coca-Cola bond at issue date was 1.73%. It is important to know that unless otherwise\nindicated, bond yields are expressed in annual percentage terms.\nWe have just demonstrated how a calculator can be used to determine the YTM or interest rate of a bond.\nLet’s look at a few more examples that cover the most common types of bond problems.

                    "answer": "The coupon rate is the fixed interest rate printed on the bond, used solely to calculate the interest or coupon payments. In contrast, the yield to maturity (YTM) is the interest rate used to discount the bond's future cash flows, reflecting the total return an investor expects to earn if they hold the bond until maturity. YTM is significant in bond valuation because it represents the internal rate of return on the bond, considering both the coupon payments and the capital gain or loss from the difference between the purchase price and the face value. It is derived from the marketplace and takes into account the riskiness of future cash flows, making it a crucial factor for investors assessing the true cost of borrowing or the potential return on investment."

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward.

Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.\nIt will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%. Let’s say that the current year’s\ndividend is $14 and the required rate of return (or discount rate) is 12%. What is the current value of Lore Ltd.\nstock?\nStep 1:\nFirst, we will need to calculate the dividends for each year until the second, stable growth rate phase is\nreached. Based on the current dividend value of $14 and the anticipated growth rate of 13%, the values of\ndividends (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) can be determined for each year of the first phase. Because the stable growth\nrate is achieved in the second phase, after five years have passed, if we assume that the current year is 2021,\nwe can lay out the profile for this stock’s dividends through the year 2026, as per Figure 11.3.\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n329\nFigure 11.3 Profile of Stock Dividend through 2026\nStep 2:\nNext, we apply the DDM to determine the terminal value, or the value of the stock at the end of the five-year\nhigh-growth phase and the beginning of the second, lower growth-phase.\nWe can apply the DDM formula at any point in time, but in this example, we are working with a stock that has\nconstant growth in dividends for five years and then decreases to a lower growth rate in its secondary phase.\nBecause of this timing and dividend structure, we calculate the value of the stock five years from now, or the\nterminal value. Again, this is calculated at the end of the high-growth phase, in 2026. By applying the constant\ngrowth DDM formula, we arrive at the following:\nThe terminal value can be calculated by applying the DDM formula in Excel, as seen in Figure 11.4 and Figure\n11.5. The terminal value, or the value at the end of 2026, is $386.91.\nFigure 11.4 Terminal Value at the End of 2026 (Showing Formula)\nFigure 11.5 Terminal Value at the End of 2026\nStep 3:\n330\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNext, we find the PV of all paid dividends that occur during the high-growth period of 2022–2026. This is shown\nin Figure 11.6. Our required rate of return (discount rate) is 12%.\nFigure 11.6 Present Value of All Paid Dividends, 2022–2026\nStep 4:\nNext, we calculate the PV of the single lump-sum terminal value:\nRemember that due to the sign convention, either the FV must be entered as a negative value or, if entered as\na positive value, the resulting PV will be negative. This example shows the former.\nStep 5:\nOur next step is to find the current fair (intrinsic) value of the stock, which comprises the PV of all future\ndividends plus the PV of the terminal value. This is represented in the following formula, with all factors shown\nin Figure 11.7:\nFigure 11.7 Fair Value of the Stock\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n331\nSo, we end up with a total current fair value of Lore Ltd. stock of $291.44 (due to Excel’s rounding), although\nthe sum can also be calculated as shown below:\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDetermining Stock Value\nTake a few minutes to review this video, which covers methods used to determine stock value\n(https://openstax.org/r/covers_methods_used_to_determine_stock_value) when dividend growth is\nnonconstant.\nAdvantages and Limitations of DDMs\nSome of the primary advantages of DDMs are their basis in the sound logic of present value concepts, their\nconsistency, and the implication that companies that pay dividends tend to be mature and stable entities. Also,\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\nsubjectivity.

During the high-growth phase, the company experiences a higher growth rate, typically around 10-15% per year, as it expands and captures market share. However, as the company matures and becomes more established, the growth rate slows down significantly to a more modest level, usually around 5-7% per year, in the stable growth phase. This transition reflects the reality that firms cannot maintain a constant high growth rate indefinitely as they face diminishing returns and saturation in their markets."

                    "answer": "To calculate the intrinsic value of Lore Ltd.'s stock using the two-stage DDM model, we follow several steps. First, we determine the dividends for each year during the high-growth phase. Given the current dividend of $14 and a growth rate of 13% for the next five years, the dividends (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) can be calculated as follows: D1 = $14 * (1 + 0.13) = $15.82, D2 = $15.82 * (1 + 0.13) = $17.90, D3 = $17.90 * (1 + 0.13) = $20.28, D4 = $20.28 * (1 + 0.13) = $22.98, D5 = $22.98 * (1 + 0.13) = $26.04. Next, we calculate the terminal value at the end of the high-growth phase, which is assumed to be a constant growth rate of 5%. Using the DDM formula, the terminal value can be found by dividing the dividend in the sixth year (D6) by the difference between the required rate of return (12%) and the terminal growth rate (5%). In this case, D6 = D5 * (1 + 0.05) = $27.34, and the terminal value is $27.34 / (0.12 - 0.05) = $390.57. We then find the present value of all paid dividends during the high-growth period by discounting each dividend back to the present using the required rate of return. Finally, we calculate the present value of the terminal value, ensuring to account for the correct sign convention. Summing the present value of the dividends and the present value of the terminal value gives us the current fair value of the stock, which in this example is $291.44."

It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\n14\nJeremy J. Siegel.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average.

Retired people may spend a greater portion\nof their income on healthcare than someone in their twenties.17 Residents on the East and West Coasts spend\na higher percentage of their earnings on housing than those living in the Midwest.18 As such, there are several\ndifferent measures of inflation based on geographic region or other factors.19 It is worth noting that a basket\nof goods and services that cost $100 in 1984 would cost approximately $260 by the end of 2020, an increase of\n160% (see Figure 12.6)! Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI\nwas 2.55%.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If",

                    "answer": "Warren Buffett's approach to investing differs from traditional value investing methods in that he expanded beyond the analysis of financial statements and intrinsic value as advocated by Benjamin Graham. While Graham focused on these aspects, Buffett also examined the character of executive management. Furthermore, he applied the same rigorous criteria to hiring employees, emphasizing the importance of integrity, intelligence, and initiative. Buffett’s strategy is characterized by a long-term perspective, advocating patience and understanding, which contrasts with the short-term speculative nature of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s. His belief in understanding a business thoroughly before investing, as exemplified by his statement 'Never invest in a business you can’t understand,' underscores his distinctive investment philosophy."

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks",

While most established economies have not generated higher returns than the US equity markets, they do offer diversification benefits. The greatest return potential—and the greatest risk of loss—may lie in developing economies. Long-run stock performance in any given country is influenced by various factors such as an entrepreneurial spirit and geographic distance from major conflicts like world wars. For instance, the United States benefited from these factors over the 121-year period reviewed by researchers Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton for Credit Suisse. However, investing experts are not in complete agreement about the advantages and disadvantages of investing in foreign equity markets, which makes careful analysis and comparison necessary."

An example of paired data would be if data were collected on employees’ years of experience and\ntheir corresponding salaries. Typically, it is of interest to investigate possible associations or correlations\nbetween the two variables under analysis.\nTime Series Graphs\nSuppose that we want to track the consumer price index (CPI) over the past 10 years. One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph\nfor the (rounded) annual CPI data (see Table 13.12). The time series graph is shown in Figure 13.7.\nYear\nCPI\n2012 226.65\n2013 230.28\n2014 233.91\nTable 13.12\nData for Time\nSeries Graph\nof Annual CPI,\n2012–2021\n(source: US\nBureau of\nLabor\nStatistics)\n13.6 • Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\n403\nYear\nCPI\n2015 233.70\n2016 236.91\n2017 242.84\n2018 247.87\n2019 251.71\n2020 257.97\n2021 261.58\nTable 13.12\nData for Time\nSeries Graph\nof Annual CPI,\n2012–2021\n(source: US\nBureau of\nLabor\nStatistics)\nFigure 13.7 Time Series Graph of Annual CPI, 2012–2021\nScatter Plots\nA scatter plot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two\nvariables. The setup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other\nvariable is plotted on the vertical axis. Then each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the\nvarious points are plotted on the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns\nor trends. Additional statistical analysis can be conducted to determine if there is a correlation or other\nstatistically significant relationship between the two variables.\nAssume we are interested in tracking the closing price of Nike stock over the one-year time period from April\n2020 to March 2021. We would also like to know if there is a correlation or relationship between the price of\nNike stock and the value of the S&P 500 over the same time period.

The\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\ntime period.\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the\nindependent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,\nthe dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or\nassociation between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we\nconclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.\nDate\nS&P 500\nNike\nStock Price\n4/1/2020 2,912.43\n87.18\n5/1/2020 3,044.31\n98.58\n6/1/2020 3,100.29\n98.05\nTable 14.1 Nike Stock Price ($) and\nValue of S&P 500 over a One-Year\nTime Period (source: Yahoo!

                    "answer": "The purpose of creating a scatter plot when investigating the correlation between two numeric quantities is to visually inspect the relationship between the two variables. By plotting the (x, y) ordered pairs on a graph, where the independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the x-variable and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable, a scatter plot allows for a visual assessment of the data points' distribution. This visual inspection helps in detecting any patterns or trends that might exist between the two variables. For instance, if the data points tend to form a line sloping upwards, it suggests a positive correlation, indicating that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable also tends to increase. Conversely, if the data points form a line sloping downwards, it suggests a negative correlation, indicating that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases. However, it's important to note that while a scatter plot can provide a preliminary indication of the nature of the relationship, a more precise assessment of the correlation can be obtained by calculating the numeric correlation coefficient (r)."

                    "answer": "The correlation coefficient, denoted by r, is a measure developed by statistician Karl Pearson in the early 1900s to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, specifically the independent variable x and the dependent variable y. It ranges from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear correlation, +1 indicates a perfect positive linear correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation. The formula for r involves several steps: calculating the sum of the x-values, the sum of the y-values, the sum of the product of each x-value and the corresponding y-value, the sum of the squares of the x-values, the sum of the squares of the y-values, and determining the number of data pairs, n. While the formula can be complex, technology like Excel or specialized software such as R is typically used to compute r. The correlation coefficient provides a more precise measure of the linear relationship compared to visual inspection alone, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the strength and direction of the association between the two variables."

We must remember that correlation\ndoes not imply causation.\nTest a Correlation Coefficient for Significance\nThe correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and\ny. The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the\nentire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,\nwhich is labeled as the Greek letter ρ (pronounced “rho”).

The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the\nunknown population correlation coefficient.\n•\nρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)\n•\nr = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)\nAn important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are\nasking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions for y based on values of x. One\nmethod to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us\ndecide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is close to zero or significantly different\nfrom zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.\nIf the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the\ncorrelation coefficient is significant.\n•\nConclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x\nand y variables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\n•\nWhat the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between the x and y variables. If the\ntest concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we\nsay that the correlation coefficient is not significant.\nA hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical\nmethod that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the\nhypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficient ρ is equal to zero.\nUse these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:\n•\nNull hypothesis:\n•\nAlternate hypothesis:\nThe hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:\n•\nNull hypothesis\n: The population correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases.

In contrast, the lower correlation with XOM implies that it is less likely to move in tandem with DAL, making it a better candidate for reducing portfolio risk. Therefore, including XOM in a portfolio alongside DAL can lead to a more significant reduction in overall portfolio volatility due to its lower correlation."

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta\nmeasures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.\nFigure 15.3 Calculation of Beta for DAL (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n463\nCAPM Equation\nBecause DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance\ntheory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for\nthis risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive\n139% of the market risk premium.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) equation is\nwhere Re is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk-free rate of return, and Rm is the expected return of\nthe market. Given the average S&P 500 return of 11.64% and the average US Treasury bill return of 3.36%, the\nexpected return of DAL would be calculated as\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCalculating Beta\nMany providers of stock data and investment information will list a company’s beta. Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCAPM\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\n8\n“Delta Air Lines, Inc.

The slope of this line represents the beta of the stock, indicating the degree to which the stock's returns move in relation to the market. In the case of DAL, the slope of the regression line was 1.39, meaning that for every 1% change in the S&P 500, DAL's returns typically changed by 1.39%.

An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any\nassumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based on that updated information.\nExcel is a versatile tool with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of\nstraightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.\nSuppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this\nproject is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to\nincrease by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know\nthat your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.\nCalculating NPV Using Excel\nTo calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row\n5 in Figure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is\nshown in row 6.\nFigure 16.4 Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.5 shows the present value of each year’s cash flow resulting from the formula. The NPV is then\ncalculated by summing the present values of the cash flows.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file) containing key Chapter 16\nExcel exhibits.\nFigure 16.5 NPV Calculated by Summing Present Values of Cash Flows ($ except Cost of Funds)\nAlternatively, Excel is programmed with financial functions, including a calculation for NPV. The NPV formula is\nshown in cell J7 in Figure 16.6 below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\n496\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperiod zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You\nmust subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.\nWhen entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the\ncells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\nthe NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project. Figure 16.8 shows the\ncompleted spreadsheet.\nFigure 16.7 Function for Calculating IRR ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.8 Final Spreadsheet ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nUsing Excel to Create an NPV Profile\nFirms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is, so they must use estimates in their\ndecision-making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\nchanges in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.\nMiddleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout\nits plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an\nestimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this\nproject will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.",

Then, you use the formula for discounting future cash flows to find the present value of each year's cash flow. The NPV is calculated by summing the present values of the cash flows. Alternatively, Excel has a built-in NPV function, but it does not include the initial investment at time zero. Therefore, you need to subtract the initial investment from the result of the NPV function to get the correct NPV. Additionally, you can create an NPV profile by changing the cost of funds and observing how the NPV of the project changes."

This lowers its taxable income to $51,720 and its taxes to $14,481.60. Because\ninterest is a tax-deductible expense, using leverage lowers the company’s taxes.\nTable 17.6 shows that the company’s net income is lower with leverage than it would be without leverage. In\nother words, debt obligations will reduce the value of the equity. However, less equity is needed because some\nof the firm is financed through debt. The important consideration is how the use of leverage changes the total\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n519\namount of dollars available to all investors. Table 17.6 shows this impact.\nWithout Leverage With Leverage\nInterest Paid to Debt Holders\n$0.00\n$280.00\nAmount Available to Stockholders\n37,440.00\n37,238.40\nTotal Available for All Investors\n$37,440.00\n$37,518.40\nTable 17.6 Total Dollars Available to Investors\nUsing leverage allows the firm to generate $37,518.40 to pay its investors, compared to only $37,440 that is\navailable if the firm is unlevered. Where does the extra $78.40 to pay investors come from? It comes from the\nreduction in taxes that the firm pays due to leverage. If the company uses no debt, it pays $14,560 in taxes. The\nlevered firm pays only $14,481.60 in taxes, a savings of $78.40.\nThe $280 that the levered company pays in interest is shielded from the corporate tax, resulting in tax savings\nof\n. The additional amount available to investors because of the tax deductibility of\ninterest payments is known as the interest tax shield. The interest tax shield is calculated as\nWhen interest is a tax-deductible expense, the total value of the levered firm will exceed the value of the\nunlevered firm by the amount of this interest tax shield. The tax-advantage status of debt financing impacts\nthe WACC. The WACC with taxes is calculated as\nThis formula can be written as\nThus, the WACC with taxes is lower than the pretax WACC because of the interest tax shield. The more debt the\nfirm has, the greater the dollar amount of this interest tax shield. The presence of the interest tax shield\nencourages firms to use debt financing in their capital structures.\n17.5\nOptimal Capital Structure\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how increased use of leverage increases the possibility of financial distress.\n•\nExplain how the possibility of financial distress impacts the cost of capital.\n•\nDiscuss the trade-offs a firm faces as it increases its leverage.\n•\nExplain the concept of an optimal capital structure.\nDebt and Financial Distress\nThe more debt a company uses in its capital structure, the larger the dollar value of the interest tax shield.\nWhy, then, do we not see firms using a capital structure composed 100% of debt to maximize this interest tax\nshield?\nThe answer to this question lies in the fact that as a company increases its debt, there is a greater chance that\nthe firm will be unable to make its required interest payments on the debt. If the firm has difficulty meeting its\n520\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt obligations, it is said to be in financial distress.\nA firm in financial distress incurs both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs of financial distress include\nfees paid to lawyers, consultants, appraisers, and auctioneers. The indirect costs include loss of customers and\nsuppliers.\nTrade-Off Theory\nTrade-off theory weighs the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the capital structure. The\nadvantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of\nfinancial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.\nA company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will\nmake it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs. Calculating the precise\nbalance between these two is difficult if not impossible.\nFor companies with a low level of debt, the risk of default is low, and the main impact of an increase in\nleverage will be an increase in the interest tax shield. At some point, however, the tax savings that result from\nincreasing the amount of debt in the capital structure will be just offset by the increased probability of\nincurring the costs of financial distress. For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years.

This reduces the company's taxable income to $51,720 and its taxes to $14,481.60. The reduction in taxes due to the interest expense creates an interest tax shield, which lowers the company’s taxes. Consequently, the company's net income is lower with leverage than it would be without leverage, but the total amount of dollars available to all investors increases to $37,518.40 from $37,440. Without leverage, the company pays $14,560 in taxes, whereas with leverage, the tax savings amount to $78.40, indicating that the interest tax shield contributes significantly to the total dollars available to investors."

Starting as a DVD rental company, Netflix\nquickly shifted its model to content streaming. In recent years, the company has become a major producer\nof content, and it is currently the largest media/entertainment company by market capitalization. It is\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content. Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress. The magnitude of the costs of financial distress increases as the debt level of the\ncompany rises. To some degree, these costs offset the benefit of the interest tax shield.\nThe optimal debt level occurs at the point at which the value of the firm is maximized. A company will use this\noptimal debt level to determine what the weight of debt should be in its target capital structure. The optimal\ncapital structure is the target. Recall that the market values of a company’s debt and equity are used to\ndetermine the costs of capital and the weights in the capital structure. Because market values change daily\ndue to economic conditions, slight variations will occur in the calculations from one day to the next. It is\nneither practical nor desirable for a firm to recalculate its optimal capital structure each day.\nAlso, a company will not want to make adjustments for minor differences between its actual capital structure\nand its optimal capital structure. For example, if a company has determined that its optimal capital structure is\n22.5% debt and 77.5% equity but finds that its current capital structure is 23.1% debt and 76.9% equity, it is\nclose to its target. Reducing debt and increasing equity would require transaction costs that might be quite\nsignificant.\nTable 17.7 shows the average WACC for some common industries. The calculations are based on corporate\ninformation at the end of December 2020. A risk-free rate of 3% and a market-risk premium of 5% are assumed\nin the calculations. You can see that the capital structure used by firms varies widely by industry. Companies in\nthe online retail industry are financed almost entirely through equity capital; on average, less than 7% of the\ncapital comes from debt for those companies. On the other hand, companies in the rubber and tires industry\ntend to use a heavy amount of debt in their capital structure. With a debt weight of 63.62%, almost two-thirds\nof the capital for these companies comes from debt.\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (online)\n93.33%\n6.67% 1.16\n8.82%\n2.93%\n2.19% 8.38%\nComputers/peripherals\n91.45%\n8.55% 1.18\n8.92%\n3.71%\n1.88% 8.32%\nHousehold products\n87.07%\n12.93% 0.73\n6.65%\n5.06%\n2.19% 6.07%\nDrugs (pharmaceutical)\n84.62%\n15.38% 0.91\n7.54%\n1.88%\n2.19% 6.72%\nTable 17.7 Capital Structure, Cost of Debt, Cost of Equity, and WACC for Selected Industries (data source: Aswath\nDamodaran Online)\n522\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIndustry Name\nEquity Weight Debt Weight Beta Cost of Equity Tax Rate\nAfter-Tax\nCost of Debt WACC\nRetail (general)\n82.41%\n17.59% 0.90\n7.49%\n12.48%\n1.88% 6.51%\nBeverages (soft)\n82.24%\n17.76% 0.79\n6.96%\n3.32%\n2.19% 6.11%\nTobacco\n76.74%\n23.26% 0.72\n6.61%\n8.69%\n1.88% 5.51%\nHomebuilding\n75.34%\n24.66% 1.46\n10.29%\n15.91%\n2.19% 8.30%\nFood processing\n75.18%\n24.82% 0.64\n6.18%\n8.56%\n2.19% 5.19%\nRestaurants/dining\n74.79%\n25.21% 1.34\n9.72%\n3.19%\n2.19% 7.82%\nApparel\n71.74%\n28.26% 1.10\n8.49%\n4.75%\n2.19% 6.71%\nFarming/agriculture\n68.94%",

However, the value of the firm starts to decrease once the interest expense equals earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), as the firm will then have no taxable income, and the tax benefit from debt is no longer available. Beyond this point, the costs of financial distress begin to outweigh the benefits of the tax shield, leading to a decline in the firm's value."

For instance, the online retail industry is predominantly financed through equity capital, with less than 7% of capital coming from debt. In contrast, the rubber and tires industry relies heavily on debt, with nearly two-thirds of capital derived from debt. Factors influencing these variations include the industry's risk profile, the cost of capital, and the availability of debt financing. Industries with higher risks may opt for more equity financing to mitigate potential losses. Additionally, industries where debt is more readily available or cheaper may favor higher levels of debt.

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis.

In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n539\nuse elements of the income statement to assess historical financial performance.

Examples of\nincome statement ratios include gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin. Common ratios that\nincorporate items from both the balance sheet and the income statement include return on assets (ROA),\nreturn on equity (ROE), inventory turnover, accounts receivable turnover, and accounts payable turnover.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPerformance Trends\nReview the most recent annual report for Big 5 Sporting Goods (https://openstax.org/r/\nannual_report_for_Big_5_Sporting-Goods).

Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential\nchanges they are considering. They may reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it\ngets them closer to their goal. They may adjust cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they feel they can\nnegotiate with vendors to work down their costs. They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail\nlocation to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save\nan entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second\nretail location would do.\nAs you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash\nplanning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new\nopportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.\nSensitivity Analysis in Forecasting\nSensitivity analysis will often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It\nexamines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular\nunderlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the\nprices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by\n10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research\ndollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the\noutcome. However, a slight change in other variables may have significant impact.\nUsing pro forma financial statements created in Excel allows management to quickly generate new pro forma\nfinancials and see the impact that each possible variable might have on the overall financial results.\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n553\n18.6\nUsing Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a financial statement forecast using spreadsheet tools.\n•\nConnect the balance sheet and income statement using appropriate formula referencing.\n•\nUse spreadsheet functions to generate appropriate iterations that balance financial forecasts.\nThroughout this chapter, we have seen forecasted financial statements for Clear Lake Sporting Goods along\nwith its forecasted cash flow. These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that\nwouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be\nquite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just\none common option, Microsoft Excel.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file) containing key Chapter 18\nExcel exhibits.\nUsing the “Sheet”\nCreating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of\nthe business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.\nCreating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the\npower of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.",

                    "answer": "Managers can use a forecast file to evaluate various potential changes in the business by tinkering with different variables. For instance, they can reduce the new salaries package by a percentage point to see if it gets them closer to their profit goals. They can also adjust the cost of goods sold by a certain percentage if they believe they can negotiate with vendors to lower their costs. Another approach is to adjust rent and explore finding a better retail location to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic. Additionally, they can create an entirely new version of the forecast and make drastic changes to see the impact of opening a second retail location. By doing so, managers can assess the potential outcomes of these changes without having to implement them in reality, allowing for informed decision-making."

                    "answer": "Sensitivity analysis assists in forecasting by examining the impact of changes in specific variables on the overall financial results. It focuses on understanding how sensitive a particular output, such as net income, is to a change in a specific underlying input, like sales or costs. For example, sensitivity analysis might investigate what happens if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted, or if the prices charged to customers are 10% more or less, or if the cost of goods sold increases by 10%. The primary goal is to identify which variables are most critical to getting right. If a variable does not significantly affect the outcome, there is no need to spend extensive resources on predicting it accurately. Instead, the focus should be on those variables that have a substantial impact, as they can influence the overall financial results more significantly."

Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit\nterms. Certainly, cash balances can be conserved by delaying payments to vendors for as long as possible;\nhowever, payments on trade credit need to be made on time or the company’s relationship with the supplier\ncan suffer. In a worst-case scenario, the company’s credit rating could also deteriorate.\nA credit rating, also called a credit score, is a measure produced by an independent agency indicating the\n572\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nlikelihood that a company will meet its financial obligations as they come due; it is an indication of the\ncompany’s ability to pay its creditors. Three business credit rating services are Equifax Small Business,\nExperian Business, and Dun & Bradstreet.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle\nConsidering the previous Think It Through (Scenario 1), what if you could reduce inventory levels, hold\nlower accounts receivable balances, and rely more heavily on accounts payable while maintaining the same\nsales level?\nHere’s Scenario 2. Because of better inventory management, credit and collections management, and\nnegotiation of longer payment periods with vendors, King Sized Products (KSP) Inc. needs less investment\nin inventory and accounts receivable and is able to utilize a greater amount of trade credit financing.\nAnnual credit sales are $40,000,000, average inventory is $2,800,000, average accounts receivable are\n$5,500,000, average accounts payable are $3,300,000, and cost of goods sold is $30,000,000. What is the\ncash conversion cycle?\nSolution:\nInventory conversion period:\n•\n•\n•\nReceivables collection period:\n•\n•\nPayables deferral period:\n•\n•\nNotice that the investment in inventory and accounts receivable is less and the average accounts payable is\nmore with no change in credit sales and cost of goods sold—you would certainly anticipate a reduction in\nthe cash conversion cycle. The improvement would be about 13 days (from 57.2 in Scenario 1 to 44.1 days in\nScenario 2). Figure 19.4 shows a bar chart comparison of the two scenarios.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2\nInventory Conversion Period\n36.50\n34.07\nReceivables Collection Period\n54.75\n50.21\nPayables Deferral Period\n34.07\n40.15\nCash Conversion Cycle\n57.18\n44.10\nTable 19.2\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n573\nFigure 19.4 Scenario 1 and 2 Comparison: Shortening the Cash Conversion Cycle\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA Harvard Business School blog post, How Amazon Survived the Dot-Com Bubble (https://openstax.org/r/\nhow-amazon-survived), discusses how Amazon managed its cash conversion cycle to the point where it was\nreceiving payment for the things it sold before Amazon had to pay for them. In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to\nmanage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,\nand a very small investment in accounts receivables.1 Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating\nfavorable payment terms with their vendors. The ability to generate consistent positive cash flow from\noperations allows a retailer like Walmart to operate with relatively low amounts of working capital.\nThe credit policies of a company also affect working capital. A company with a liberal credit policy will require a\ngreater amount of working capital, as collection periods of accounts receivable are longer and therefore tie up\n1",

                    "question": "What factors contribute to a shorter cash conversion cycle, and how does this impact a company's working capital needs?",
                    "answer": "A shorter cash conversion cycle is achieved by reducing inventory levels, holding lower accounts receivable balances, and relying more heavily on accounts payable while maintaining the same sales level. This can be seen in Scenario 2 where King Sized Products (KSP) Inc., through better inventory management, credit and collections management, and negotiation of longer payment periods with vendors, reduces its investment in inventory and accounts receivable and utilizes more trade credit financing. The cash conversion cycle is calculated using three key periods: the inventory conversion period, the receivables collection period, and the payables deferral period. By optimizing these periods, KSP Inc. is able to reduce its cash conversion cycle from 57.2 days to 44.1 days, demonstrating the impact of these changes on working capital needs. This optimization leads to a more efficient use of working capital, allowing the company to maintain its operations with fewer funds tied up in inventory and receivables while extending payment periods to suppliers."

                    "answer": "Different industries exhibit significant variation in their working capital needs. Industries such as grocery and retail businesses can have very low cash conversion cycles, whereas construction companies often experience very high cash conversion cycles. For instance, home construction companies typically have a long operating cycle due to the production process of building homes, leading to high current ratios, possibly as high as 11 or 12 times current liabilities. In contrast, retailers like Walmart or Target have much lower current ratios due to their quicker inventory turnover and smaller investments in accounts receivables. Another example is the restaurant industry, which can have very low cash conversion cycles and even achieve negative cash conversion cycles, meaning they receive payment before incurring costs. These variations highlight the importance of understanding specific industry norms when assessing a company's working capital requirements."

Some\nof the “inputs” to the cash budget are from the sales (collections of cash), purchases (payments), and the\noperating expense budget (cash expenditures for selling and administrative expenses). A sample cash budget\nand a discussion of its preparation follows in the next section of this chapter.\n586\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSample Cash Budget\nA cash budget is the last budget to be prepared and is often part of the financial budget (cash budget,\nbudgeted income statement, and budgeted balance sheet). The purpose of the cash budget is to estimate\ncash flows, to help ensure sufficient cash balances are maintained during the planning period, and to plan for\nexternal financing during periods of cash deficits.\nWhen a budget is prepared in Excel, cash budget analysts can play “what if” with different scenarios to see\nwhen cash surpluses and deficits are expected. Cash surpluses means that funds can be invested in\nmarketable securities to earn a rate of return, while cash deficits mean that financing, such as a line of credit,\nwill be necessary (assuming forecasts are accurate).\nAlthough the example shown in Figure 19.10 is a monthly cash budget, a cash budget could be prepared using\nany useful time elements: weekly, monthly, or quarterly.\nOne common practice is to use a rolling cash budget. A rolling cash budget is continually updated to add a\nnew budget period, such as a month’s amount of cash flow activity, as the most recent budgeted month\nexpires. For example, assume that a 12-month cash budget is prepared for a period covering January 20X1 to\nDecember 20X1. Once the month of January 20X1 has concluded, a 12-month planning period continues by\nadd January 20X2 to the last column of the budget. The rolling cash monthly budget is an extension of the\ninitial cash budget model, adding one month and thereby always extending cash flow projections one year\ninto the future.\nFigure 19.9 Operating Expenses Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n587\nFigure 19.10 Sample Cash Budget\nUsing Figure 19.9 as an example, Table 19.5 shows the formulas that form the skeleton of a monthly cash\nbudget.\nBeginning\nCash Balance\nThis is the amount of cash the company expects to have on the first day of the month. For\nexample, in Figure 19.10, cell B2 is the amount of cash on Jan. 1 to start the year (the planning\nperiod). The remaining beginning cash balances for the months February through December\nare the ending cash balances of the previous month. For example, February’s beginning cash\nbalance (C2) is referenced from cell B9 (ending cash balance for January).\nCash\nCollections\nThese are the projected cash inflows from collections from customers (accounts receivable),\ncash sales, and any other significant cash inflows, such as dividends and interest on\ninvestments or sale of fixed assets. For example, the Cash Collections shown in the Sample\nCash Budget (Figure 19.10) are referenced from the Sales and Collections Budget (Figure\n19.7). January’s Cash Collections (cell B3) in the Sample Cash Budget are from cell B12 of the\nSales and Collection Budget.\nCash\nDisbursements\nCash disbursements are the projected cash outflows, such as those for operating expenses\nand payment of payables. For example, Cash Disbursements in the Sample Cash Budget for\nJanuary (Figure 19.10) are the sum of January’s payments for purchases in the Purchases\nBudget (Figure 19.8, cell B3) and the January operating expenses (Operating Expenses\nBudget, Figure 19.9, cell B12).\nNet Cash Flow\nThe formula for net cash flow is For example, in Figure 19.10, the January Net Cash Flow is\ncalculated in cell B5.\nPreliminary\nEnding Cash\nBalance\nBeginning Cash Balance + or - Net Cash Flow.

You will also\nlearn about ways in which firms can reduce their exposure to these risks. When firms take actions to reduce\ntheir exposures to risk, they are said to be hedging. Firms hedge to try to protect themselves from losses.\nThus, in finance, hedging is a risk management tool.\nCertain strategies are commonly used by firms to hedge risk, which is part of corporate financial management.\nMany of these same strategies can be used by economic players who wish to speculate. Speculating occurs\nwhen someone bets on a future outcome. It involves trying to predict the future and profit off of that\nprediction, knowing that there is some risk that an incorrect prediction will lead to a loss.

A change in the\nmarket price of these raw materials can significantly impact the profitability of a company.\nFor example, Starbucks must purchase coffee beans in order to make its coffee drinks. The price of coffee\nbeans is highly volatile. Sample prices of a pound of Arabica coffee beans over the past couple of decades are\nshown in Table 20.1. Over this period, the price of coffee beans ranged from a low of $0.52 per pound in the\nsummer of 2002 to a high of over $3.00 per pound in the spring of 2011. The costs, and thus the profits, of\nStarbucks will vary greatly depending on if the company is paying less than $1.00 per pound for coffee or if it is\npaying three times that much.\nDate\nPrice per Pound ($)\nJanuary 1, 2000\n1.09\nJanuary 1, 2004\n0.74\nJanuary 1, 2008\n1.39\nJanuary 1, 2012\n2.41\nJanuary 1, 2016\n1.46\nJanuary 1, 2020\n1.50\nTable 20.1 Price of Coffee in Select Years,\n2000-20205\nLong-Term Contracts\nOne method of hedging the risk of volatile input prices is for a firm to enter into long-term contracts with its\nsuppliers. Starbucks, for example, could enter into an agreement with a coffee farmer to purchase a particular\nquantity of coffee beans at a predetermined price over the next several years.\nThese long-term contracts can benefit both the buyer and the seller. The buyer is concerned that rising\ncommodity prices will increase its cost of goods sold. The seller, however, is concerned that falling commodity\nprices will mean lower revenue. By entering into a long-term contract, the buyer is able to lock in a price for its\nraw materials and the seller is able to lock in its sales price. Thus, both parties are able to reduce uncertainty.\nWhile long-term contracts reduce uncertainty about the commodity price, and thus reduce risk, there are",

                    "answer": "The term used to describe the increase in value of an asset over time, which is often realized when the asset is sold for more than its purchase price, is capital gain yield. This concept is closely related to capital gains, which refer to the profit made from the sale of an asset that has increased in value. Capital gains are a key component of investment returns and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions."
