Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Political conflicts during judges' confirmation processes in the Senate could arise due to the balance of power among different political factions. Over the past fifty years, such divisions have been relatively common, indicating that these conflicts are a recurring issue in the American political system. These conflicts may stem from differing views on judicial philosophy, policy priorities, or ideological stances. The Senate's role in confirming judges means that each confirmation process can become a proxy for broader political disagreements, making it a focal point for debate and negotiation."

The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office.

                    "answer": "Term risk refers to the potential loss faced by investors who invest in bonds with fixed interest rates due to rising interest rates. This risk arises because the fixed interest rate on a bond may become less attractive compared to the returns from newer, lower-paying investments as interest rates increase over time. Term risk is typically quantified using a measure known as the term premium."

Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate bond valuations using Excel.\n•\nDemonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.\nCalculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond",

                    "answer": "When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and conversely, when interest rates fall, bond values increase. This inverse relationship exists because the coupon payments from existing bonds become less attractive when new bonds are issued with higher interest rates. As a result, the market price of older bonds must drop to make their yield competitive with newer, higher-yielding bonds."
