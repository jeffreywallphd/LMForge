            "chunk": "there are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory. Positivism is a philosophical movement that claims that science provides the only knowledge \nprecise enough to be worthwhile. But what are we to make of the social phenomena of laws? \n \nWe could examine existing statutes—executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions—in a fairly \nprecise way to find out what the law says. For example, we could look at the posted speed limits on most \nUS highways and conclude that the “correct” or “right” speed is no more than fifty-five miles per hour. Or \nwe could look a little deeper and find out how the written law is usually applied. Doing so, we might \nconclude that sixty-one miles per hour is generally allowed by most state troopers, but that occasionally \nsomeone gets ticketed for doing fifty-seven miles per hour in a fifty-five miles per hour zone. Either \napproach is empirical, even if not rigorously scientific. The first approach, examining in a precise way \nwhat the rule itself says, is sometimes known as the “positivist” school of legal thought. The second \napproach—which relies on social context and the actual behavior of the principal actors who enforce the \nlaw—is akin to the “legal realist” school of thought (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"). \n \nPositivism has its limits and its critics. New Testament readers may recall that King Herod, fearing the \nbirth of a Messiah, issued a decree that all male children below a certain age be killed. Because it was the \ncommand of a sovereign, the decree was carried out (or, in legal jargon, the decree was “executed”). \nSuppose a group seizes power in a particular place and commands that women cannot attend school and \ncan only be treated medically by women, even if their condition is life-threatening and women doctors are \nfew and far between. Suppose also that this command is carried out, just because it is the law and is \nenforced with a vengeance. People who live there will undoubtedly question the wisdom, justice, or \ngoodness of such a law, but it is law nonetheless and is generally carried out. To avoid the law’s impact, a \ncitizen would have to flee the country entirely. During the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, from which this \nexample is drawn, many did flee. \n \nThe positive-law school of legal thought would recognize the lawmaker’s command as legitimate; \nquestions about the law’s morality or immorality would not be important. In contrast, the natural-law \nschool of legal thought would refuse to recognize the legitimacy of laws that did not conform to natural, \nuniversal, or divine law. If a lawmaker issued a command that was in violation of natural law, a citizen \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n8 \nwould be morally justified in demonstrating civil disobedience. For example, in refusing to give up her \nseat to a white person, Rosa Parks believed that she was refusing to obey an unjust law. \n \nNatural Law \nThe natural-law school of thought emphasizes that law should be based on a universal moral order. \nNatural law was “discovered” by humans through the use of reason and by choosing between that which is \ngood and that which is evil. Here is the definition of natural law according to the Cambridge Dictionary of \nPhilosophy: “Natural law, also called the law of nature in moral and political philosophy, is an objective \nnorm or set of objective norms governing human behavior, similar to the positive laws of a human ruler, \nbut binding on all people alike and usually understood as involving a superhuman legislator.” [1] \n \nBoth the US Constitution and the United Nations (UN) Charter have an affinity for the natural-law \noutlook, as it emphasizes certain objective norms and rights of individuals and nations. The US \nDeclaration of Independence embodies a natural-law philosophy. The following short extract should \nprovide some sense of the deep beliefs in natural law held by those who signed the document. \n \n \n \n \nThe Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America \nJuly 4, 1776 \nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political \nbands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, \nthe separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a \ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which \nimpel them to the separation. \n \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by",

                    "question": "What does Legal Positivism claim about the nature of law and how does it differ from Natural Law?",
                    "answer": "Legal Positivism posits that law is essentially a command from a sovereign authority that can be enforced, emphasizing the importance of a recognized authority and the ability to enforce laws within a defined territory. This perspective focuses on the positivist approach of examining statutes, executive orders, regulations, or judicial decisions in a precise manner to ascertain the 'correct' or 'right' rules. On the other hand, Natural Law advocates for a moral foundation in the creation and enforcement of laws, asserting that they should be grounded in universal moral principles. According to Natural Law, a law that violates these moral principles is not legitimate and citizens are justified in disobeying such laws. This fundamental difference lies in the source of legitimacy: Legal Positivism bases it on human authority and enforcement capability, while Natural Law roots it in moral or divine law."

                    "answer": "The example of King Herod's decree illustrates how Legal Positivism views a command as legitimate simply because it originates from a sovereign, regardless of its moral implications. From a Legal Positivist standpoint, the decree to kill male children below a certain age, being a command of a sovereign, would be considered a valid law, and individuals would be required to comply with it. However, from a Natural Law perspective, such a decree would be seen as immoral and unjust, as it violates universal moral principles. This example highlights the limitation of Legal Positivism in recognizing the moral dimensions of laws, whereas Natural Law insists on a moral evaluation of legal commands, allowing for the possibility of civil disobedience when a law conflicts with these principles."

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations). Basic ethical norms for promise-keeping and not harming others are reflected in the civil law of \ncontracts and torts. In the United States, both the states and the federal government have roles to play, and",

                    "answer": "In a legal system, there are various types of remedies available to address different forms of wrongdoing. These remedies can be categorized into two main groups: legal remedies and equitable remedies. Legal remedies, such as money damages, aim to compensate the victim for losses suffered due to the defendant's actions. On the other hand, equitable remedies, including fines, jail, and forfeitures, are designed to punish the wrongdoer and deter future misconduct. Additionally, there are specific equitable remedies such as injunctions and specific performance, which are tailored to address unique situations where monetary compensation may not suffice."

                    "answer": "One way to differentiate between a civil case and a criminal case is by examining the case caption. Typically, if the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. Lieberman or State v. Seidel), it indicates that the government is prosecuting on behalf of the people. However, this method is not always reliable, as governments can also initiate civil actions to collect debts or resolve disputes. For instance, U.S. v. Mayer might involve a tax collection action, and U.S. v. Canada could represent a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, individuals or entities can sue the government under certain conditions, but the government must waive its sovereign immunity for such suits to proceed."

If you are engaged to be married and your spouse-to-be bolts from the wedding \nceremony, there are some states that do provide a legal basis on which to bring a lawsuit. “Breach of \npromise to marry” is recognized in several states, but most states have abolished this cause of action, \neither by judicial decision or by legislation. Whether a runaway bride or groom gives rise to a valid cause \nof action in the courts depends on whether the state courts still recognize and enforce this now-\ndisappearing cause of action. \n \nYour cause of action is thus based on existing laws, including decided cases. How closely your case “fits” \nwith a prior decided case raises the question of precedent. \n \nAs noted earlier in this chapter, the English common-law tradition placed great emphasis on precedent \nand what is called stare decisis. A court considering one case would feel obliged to decide that case in a \nway similar to previously decided cases. Written decisions of the most important cases had been spread \nthroughout England (the common “realm”), and judges hoped to establish a somewhat predictable, \nconsistent group of decisions. \n \nThe English legislature (Parliament) was not in the practice of establishing detailed statutes on crimes, \ntorts, contracts, or property. Thus definitions and rules were left primarily to the courts. By their nature, \ncourts could only decide one case at a time, but in doing so they would articulate holdings, or general \nrules, that would apply to later cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n27 \nSuppose that one court had to decide whether an employer could fire an employee for no reason at all. \nSuppose that there were no statutes that applied to the facts: there was no contract between the employer \nand the employee, but the employee had worked for the employer for many years, and now a younger \nperson was replacing him. The court, with no past guidelines, would have to decide whether the employee \nhad stated a “cause of action” against the employer. If the court decided that the case was not legally \nactionable, it would dismiss the action. Future courts would then treat similar cases in a similar way. In \nthe process, the court might make a holding that employers could fire employees for any reason or for no \nreason. This rule could be applied in the future should similar cases come up. \n \nBut suppose that an employer fired an employee for not committing perjury (lying on the witness stand in \na court proceeding); the employer wanted the employee to cover up the company's criminal or unethical \nact. Suppose that, as in earlier cases, there were no applicable statutes and no contract of employment. \nCourts relying on a holding or precedent that “employers may fire employees for any reason or no reason” \nmight rule against an employee seeking compensation for being fired for telling the truth on the witness \nstand. Or it might make an exception to the general rule, such as, “Employers may generally discharge \nemployees for any reason or for no reason without incurring legal liability; however, employers will incur \nlegal liability for firing an employee who refuses to lie on behalf of the employer in a court proceeding.” \n \nIn each case (the general rule and its exception), the common-law tradition calls for the court to explain \nthe reasons for its ruling. In the case of the general rule, “freedom of choice” might be the major reason. \nIn the case of the perjury exception, the efficiency of the judicial system and the requirements of \ncitizenship might be used as reasons. Because the court’s “reasons” will be persuasive to some and not to \nothers, there is inevitably a degree of subjectivity to judicial opinions. That is, reasonable people will \ndisagree as to the persuasiveness of the reasoning a court may offer for its decision. \n \nWritten judicial opinions are thus a good playing field for developing critical thinking skills by identifying \nthe issue in a case and examining the reasons for the court’s previous decision(s), or holding. \nWhat has the court actually decided, and why? Remember that a court, especially the US Supreme Court, \nis not only deciding one particular case but also setting down guidelines (in its holdings) for federal and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n28 \nstate courts that encounter similar issues. Note that court cases often raise a variety of issues or questions \nto be resolved, and judges (and attorneys) will differ as to what the real issue in a case is. A holding is the \ncourt’s complete answer to an issue that is critical to deciding the case and thus gives guidance to the \nmeaning of the case as a precedent for future cases. \n \nBeyond the decision of the court, it is in looking at the court’s reasoning that you are most likely to \nunderstand what facts have been most significant to the court and what theories (schools of legal thought) \neach trial or appellate judge believes in.

When there are no specific statutes or contracts guiding a case, courts must create new rules through their decisions. For instance, if an employer fires an employee for no reason, and there are no applicable statutes or contracts, the court would need to decide whether the case is legally actionable. The court might decide that employers can fire employees for any reason or for no reason, creating a general rule that could be applied in future similar cases. Alternatively, the court might make an exception, such as allowing legal liability for firing an employee who refuses to commit perjury. In both scenarios, the court explains the reasons for its ruling, which might include concepts like freedom of choice or the efficiency of the judicial system.

They provide a detailed account of the court's reasoning, the significance of the facts, and the theories or schools of legal thought held by each judge. By analyzing these opinions, individuals can identify the key issues in a case and examine the reasons behind the court's previous decisions, known as holdings. This process helps in comprehending the court's actual decision and the underlying rationale. Furthermore, it allows for the evaluation of different perspectives and the recognition that reasonable people may disagree on the persuasiveness of the reasoning offered by the court. Through this analysis, one can gain insight into the complexities of legal decision-making and the potential subjectivity involved. Ultimately, judicial opinions act as a playing field for honing critical thinking skills and deepening one's understanding of the legal system and its principles."

(1988 ed., Supp. III). \n \n \n \nI \n \nTeresa Harris worked as a manager at Forklift Systems, Inc., an equipment rental company, from \nApril 1985 until October 1987. Charles Hardy was Forklift’s president. \nThe Magistrate found that, throughout Harris’ time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of \nher gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendoes. Hardy told Harris on \nseveral occasions, in the presence of other employees, “You’re a woman, what do you know” and “We \nneed a man as the rental manager”; at least once, he told her she was “a dumbass woman.” Again in \nfront of others, he suggested that the two of them “go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris’s] \nraise.” Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants \npocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick \nthe objects up. He made sexual innuendoes about Harris’ and other women’s clothing. \n \nIn mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised \nthat Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would \nstop, and based on this assurance Harris stayed on the job. But in early September, Hardy began \nanew: While Harris was arranging a deal with one of Forklift’s customers, he asked her, again in \nfront of other employees, “What did you do, promise the guy…some [sex] Saturday night?” On \nOctober 1, Harris collected her paycheck and quit. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n34 \nHarris then sued Forklift, claiming that Hardy’s conduct had created an abusive work environment \nfor her because of her gender. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, \nadopting the report and recommendation of the Magistrate, found this to be “a close case,” but held \nthat Hardy’s conduct did not create an abusive environment. The court found that some of Hardy’s \ncomments “offended [Harris], and would offend the reasonable woman,” but that they were not “so \nsevere as to be expected to seriously affect [Harris’s] psychological well-being. A reasonable woman \nmanager under like circumstances would have been offended by Hardy, but his conduct would not \nhave risen to the level of interfering with that person’s work performance. \n \n“Neither do I believe that [Harris] was subjectively so offended that she suffered injury.…Although \nHardy may at times have genuinely offended [Harris], I do not believe that he created a working \nenvironment so poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to [Harris].” \n \nIn focusing on the employee’s psychological well-being, the District Court was following Circuit \nprecedent.

Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR §§ \n1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR § 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.

We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2.

Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the \ncommon law? \n4. In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to \nequal treatment in the workplace? Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial? Or should \nthe judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court? \n5. What was the employer’s argument in this case? Do you agree or disagree with it? What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies. It has also given you a brief background in common",

                    "answer": "When determining if an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive' under Title VII, several factors are considered. These include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely an offensive utterance, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. Psychological well-being is relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive, but it is just one of many factors that may be taken into account. No single factor is required for a determination, and the overall context of the situation is crucial."

                    "answer": "Civil law deals primarily with disputes between individuals or organizations, such as contracts, torts, and property rights, and focuses on resolving conflicts and compensating victims. Criminal law, on the other hand, addresses offenses against the public or society as a whole, and its primary aim is to punish those who commit crimes. These differences significantly impact the legal system as civil cases often involve private parties seeking remedies, while criminal cases involve the state prosecuting individuals for violations of the law. The procedural and evidentiary rules, as well as the potential penalties, differ substantially between these two types of law, reflecting the different purposes and outcomes sought in each context."

It posits that laws derived from natural reason are superior to those created by human authority alone. For instance, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, reflects many principles of natural law, such as the right to life, liberty, and security of person. Additionally, constitutional law often incorporates natural law principles, ensuring that laws are just and protect fundamental human rights. Natural law also shapes legal education and ethical considerations in legal practice, emphasizing the importance of moral reasoning in judicial decision-making and legislative processes."

Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.

Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct \nthan achieving the right results. A deontologist like Kant is likely to believe that ethical action arises from \ndoing one’s duty and that duties are defined by rational thought. Duties, according to Kant, are not \nspecific to particular kinds of human beings but are owed universally to all human beings. Kant therefore \nuses “universalizing“ as a form of rational thought that assumes the inherent equality of all human beings. \nIt considers all humans as equal, not in the physical, social, or economic sense, but equal before God, \nwhether they are male, female, Pygmy, Eskimoan, Islamic, Christian, gay, straight, healthy, sick, young, or \nold. \n \nFor Kantian thinkers, this basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any \nparticular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. For example, if you were to consider \nmisrepresenting yourself on a resume for a particular job you really wanted and you were convinced that \ndoing so would get you that job, you might be very tempted to do so. (What harm would it be? you might \nask yourself. When I have the job, I can prove that I was perfect for it, and no one is hurt, while both the \nemployer and I are clearly better off as a result!) Kantian ethicists would answer that your chosen course \nof action should be a universal one—a course of action that would be good for all persons at all times. \nThere are two requirements for a rule of action to be universal: consistency and reversibility. Consider \nreversibility: if you make a decision as though you didn’t know what role or position you would have after \nthe decision, you would more likely make an impartial one—you would more likely choose a course of \naction that would be most fair to all concerned, not just you. Again, deontology requires that we put \nduty first, act rationally, and give moral weight to the inherent equality of all human beings. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n53 \nIn considering whether to lie on your resume, reversibility requires you to actively imagine both that you \nwere the employer in this situation and that you were another well-qualified applicant who lost the job \nbecause someone else padded his resume with false accomplishments. If the consequences of such an \nexercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. \n \nThe second requirement for an action to be universal is the search for consistency. This is more abstract. \nA deontologist would say that since you know you are telling a lie, you must be willing to say that lying, as \na general, universal phenomenon, is acceptable. But if everyone lied, then there would be no point to \nlying, since no one would believe anyone. It is only because honesty works well for society as a whole and \nis generally practiced that lying even becomes possible! That is, lying cannot be universalized, for it \ndepends on the preexistence of honesty. \n \nSimilar demonstrations can be made for actions such as polluting, breaking promises, and committing \nmost crimes, including rape, murder, and theft. But these are the easy cases for Kantian thinkers. In the \ngray areas of life as it is lived, the consistency test is often difficult to apply. If breaking a promise would \nsave a life, then Kantian thought becomes difficult to apply. If some amount of pollution can allow \nemployment and the harm is minimal or distant, Kantian thinking is not all that helpful. Finally, we \nshould note that the well-known Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” \nemphasizes the easier of the two universalizing requirements: practicing reversibility (“How would I like it \nif someone did this to me?”). \n \nSocial Justice Theory and Social Contract Theory \nSocial justice theorists worry about “distributive justice”—that is, what is the fair way to distribute goods \namong a group of people? Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society,",

This basic principle of equality means that we should be able to universalize any particular law or action to determine whether it is ethical. The two requirements for a rule of action to be universal are consistency and reversibility. Consistency requires that a rule of action can be applied universally without contradiction, meaning that if everyone were to follow the same rule, it would still hold true.

Reversibility requires that you put yourself in the shoes of others to ensure that your actions would be fair and impartial. If the consequences of such an exercise of the imagination are not appealing to you, your action is probably not ethical. For instance, as the employer, you might find it unfair to hire someone who lied on their resume, and as the applicant, you would want to be hired based on genuine qualifications.

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

Unlike other values such as wealth, power, fitness, or intelligence, having these core values does make one more virtuous in character and habits. For example, being honest and keeping promises increases trustworthiness, and staying true to these values contributes to overall ethical behavior. On the other hand, while many people may value wealth or good looks, possessing these qualities alone does not necessarily make someone virtuous. Additionally, the six core values share a commonality with other ethical values that are less universally agreed upon. Some families or religious institutions may strongly adhere to virtues like saving money or abstinence, yet others may not practice or admire these specific values. Nonetheless, individuals can still embody core ethical values regardless of their financial status, drinking habits, or relationship choices."

Shareholders \nelect directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. From this structure, some very basic \nrealities follow. Because the directors of a corporation do not meet that often, it’s possible for the officers \nhired (top management, or the “C-suite”) to be selective of what the board knows about, and directors are \nnot always ready and able to provide the oversight that the shareholders would like. Nor does the law \nrequire officers to be shareholders, so that officers’ motivations may not align with the best interests of the \ncompany. This is the “agency problem” often discussed in corporate governance: how to get officers and \nother top management to align their own interests with those of the shareholders. For example, a CEO \nmight trade insider information to the detriment of the company’s shareholders. Even board members are \nsusceptible to misalignment of interets; for example, board members might resist hostile takeover bids \nbecause they would likely lose their perks (short for perquisites) as directors, even though the tender offer \nwould benefit stockholders. Among other attempted realignments, the use of stock options was an \nattempt to make managers more attentive to the value of company stock, but the law of unintended \nconsequences was in full force; managers tweaked and managed earnings in the bubble of the 1990s bull \nmarket, and “managing by numbers” became an epidemic in corporations organized under US corporate \nlaw.

                    "answer": "The typical corporate legal structure involves shareholders electing directors, who then hire officers to manage the company. This structure leads to the 'agency problem,' where top management may prioritize their own interests over those of the shareholders. Directors may not provide sufficient oversight due to infrequent meetings, and officers hired to manage the company may not be shareholders, leading to potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, the lack of alignment between officers' motivations and the best interests of the company can result in unethical behavior, such as trading insider information or resisting hostile takeovers for personal benefits. To address these issues, efforts have been made to bolster shareholder rights through changes in state and federal law, although the fundamental challenge of aligning management's interests with shareholders remains a significant ethical challenge in corporate governance."

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities? Only people can have \nresponsibilities. A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n67 \nresponsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this \nvague sense.… \n \nPresumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual \nproprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate \nexecutive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes. If these are “social responsibilities,” \nthey are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business. \n \nWhat does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity \nas businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the",

Companies that practice conscious capitalism embrace the idea that profit and \nprosperity can and must go hand in hand with social justice and environmental stewardship. They operate \nwith a holistic or systems view. This means that they understand that all stakeholders are connected and \ninterdependent. They reject false trade-offs between stakeholder interests and strive for creative ways to \nachieve win-win-win outcomes for all. [7] \n \nThe “conscious business” has a purpose that goes beyond maximizing profits. It is designed to maximize \nprofits but is focused more on its higher purpose and does not fixate solely on the bottom line. To do so, it \nfocuses on delivering value to all its stakeholders, harmonizing as best it can the interests of consumers, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n76 \npartners, investors, the community, and the environment. This requires that company managers take a \n“servant leadership” role, serving as stewards to the company’s deeper purpose and to the company’s \nstakeholders. \n \nConscious business leaders serve as such stewards, focusing on fulfilling the company’s purpose, \ndelivering value to its stakeholders, and facilitating a harmony of interests, rather than on personal gain \nand self-aggrandizement. Why is this refocusing needed? Within the standard profit-maximizing model, \ncorporations have long had to deal with the “agency problem.” Actions by top-level managers—acting on \nbehalf of the company—should align with the shareholders, but in a culture all about winning and money, \nmanagers sometimes act in ways that are self-aggrandizing and that do not serve the interests of \nshareholders. Laws exist to limit such self-aggrandizing, but the remedies are often too little and too late \nand often catch only the most egregious overreaching. Having a culture of servant leadership is a much \nbetter way to see that a company’s top management works to ensure a harmony of interests. \n \n  \n \n[1] See Robert Jackall, Moral Mazes: The World of Corporate Managers (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988). \n[2] John Schwartz, “An Enron Unit Chief Warned, and Was Rebuffed,” New York Times, February 20, 2002. \n[3] Warren Bennis, “A Corporate Fear of Too Much Truth,” New York Times, February 17, 2002. \n[4] University of Oklahoma Department of Defense Joint Course in Communication, Case Study: The Johnson & \nJohnson Tylenol Crisis, accessed April 5, 2011. \n[5] FindLaw, Report of Investigation by the Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron Corp., \nFebruary 1, 2002, accessed April 5, 2011,http://news.findlaw.com/wsj/docs/enron/sicreport. \n[6] Steven Pearlstein, “Debating the Enron Effect,” Washington Post, February 17, 2002. \n[7] Milton Friedman, John Mackey, and T.

Each business needs to create or maintain \na culture of ethical excellence, where there is ongoing dialogue not only about the best technical practices \nbut also about the company’s ethical challenges and practices.

This ruling implies that Mr. Hardy's actions were indeed unethical, as they contributed to an environment that made Ms. Harris feel unsafe and uncomfortable. Ethically, Mr. Hardy should have taken steps to ensure a respectful and inclusive workplace, as such behavior can lead to significant distress and harm to employees. The fact that the case proceeded to a trial suggests that the behavior was severe enough to warrant legal scrutiny, indicating that Mr. Hardy's actions went beyond mere personal preferences and crossed into unethical territory. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions may have led to negative outcomes for Ms. Harris and other employees, thus violating the principle of maximizing overall well-being. From a deontological standpoint, his actions violated established principles of respect for individuals, which are fundamental to ethical behavior.

A court that hears appeals from the trial court is said to have appellate jurisdiction—it must \naccept the facts as determined by the trial court and limit its review to the lower court’s theory of the \napplicable law. \n \nLimited Jurisdiction Courts \nIn most large urban states and many smaller states, there are four and sometimes five levels of courts. The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states). Most disputes that wind up in court are handled in the 18,000-\nplus limited jurisdiction courts, which are estimated to hear more than 80 percent of all cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n85 \nOne familiar limited jurisdiction court is the small claims court, with jurisdiction to hear civil cases \ninvolving claims for amounts ranging between $1,000 and $5,000 in about half the states and for \nconsiderably less in the other states ($500 to $1,000). The advantage of the small claims court is that its \nprocedures are informal, it is often located in a neighborhood outside the business district, it is usually \nopen after business hours, and it is speedy. Lawyers are not necessary to present the case and in some \nstates are not allowed to appear in court. \n \nGeneral Jurisdiction Courts \nAll other civil and criminal cases are heard in the general trial courts, or courts of general jurisdiction. \nThese go by a variety of names: superior, circuit, district, or common pleas court (New York calls its \ngeneral trial court the supreme court). These are the courts in which people seek redress for incidents \nsuch as automobile accidents and injuries, or breaches of contract. These state courts also prosecute those \naccused of murder, rape, robbery, and other serious crimes. The fact finder in these general jurisdiction \ncourts is not a judge, as in the lower courts, but a jury of citizens. \n \nAlthough courts of general jurisdiction can hear all types of cases, in most states more than half involve \nfamily matters (divorce, child custody disputes, and the like). A third were commercial cases, and slightly \nover 10 percent were devoted to car accident cases and other torts (as discussed in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\"). \n \nMost states have specialized courts that hear only a certain type of case, such as landlord-tenant disputes \nor probate of wills. Decisions by judges in specialized courts are usually final, although any party \ndissatisfied with the outcome may be able to get a new trial in a court of general jurisdiction. Because \nthere has been one trial already, this is known as a trial de novo. It is not an appeal, since the case \nessentially starts over. \n \nAppellate Courts \nThe losing party in a general jurisdiction court can almost always appeal to either one or two higher \ncourts. These intermediate appellate courts—usually called courts of appeal—have been established in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n86 \nforty states. They do not retry the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial was conducted in a \nprocedurally correct manner and whether the appropriate law was applied. For example, the appellant \n(the losing party who appeals) might complain that the judge wrongly instructed the jury on the meaning \nof the law, or improperly allowed testimony of a particular witness, or misconstrued the law in question. \nThe appellee (who won in the lower court) will ask that the appellant be denied—usually this means that \nthe appellee wants the lower-court judgment affirmed.

                    "question": "What is the role of appellate courts in the legal system?",
                    "answer": "Appellate courts play a crucial role in the legal system by reviewing decisions made by lower courts. They primarily focus on procedural correctness and the application of law during the original trial. Appellate courts do not re-examine the factual evidence presented in the lower court; instead, they evaluate whether the legal proceedings were conducted appropriately and if the correct laws were applied. Parties involved in a dispute can appeal to an intermediate appellate court if they believe there were errors in the lower court's procedures or rulings. These appellate courts can affirm, modify, reverse, or remand the decision back to the lower court for retrial. The ultimate appellate court in the state system is the state supreme court, which is typically located in the state capital and composed of a panel of judges. In a select few cases where federal constitutional issues are raised, litigants may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari."

                    "answer": "State court systems typically consist of multiple levels, including limited jurisdiction courts, general jurisdiction courts, and appellate courts. Limited jurisdiction courts handle minor criminal and civil cases, while general jurisdiction courts deal with more significant cases, such as family matters, commercial disputes, and serious crimes. Appellate courts review decisions from general jurisdiction courts to ensure procedural correctness and proper application of the law. In contrast, the federal court system is standardized across the United States and includes three levels: district courts, circuit courts of appeals, and the Supreme Court. District courts are the trial courts where cases are initially heard, circuit courts of appeals review decisions from district courts, and the Supreme Court serves as the final appellate authority. This structure allows for consistent application of federal law across the nation."

If it’s a case based on state law, a state court will always have \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n3 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case that is either based on a federal law \n(statute, case, or US Constitution) \nOR \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n95 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case based on state law where the parties \nare (1) from different states and (2) the amount in controversy is at least $75,000. \n(1) The different states requirement means that no plaintiff can have permanent residence in a state \nwhere any defendant has permanent residence—there must be complete diversity of citizenship as \nbetween all plaintiffs and defendants. \n(2) The amount in controversy requirement means that a good-faith estimate of the amount the \nplaintiff may recover is at least $75,000. \nNOTE: For purposes of permanent residence, a corporation is considered a resident where it is \nincorporated AND where it has a principal place of business. \n4 \nIn diversity cases, the following rules apply. \n(1) Federal civil procedure rules apply to how the case is conducted before and during trial \nand any appeals, but \n(2) State law will be used as the basis for a determination of legal rights and responsibilities. \n(a) This “choice of law” process is interesting but complicated. Basically, each state has \nits own set of judicial decisions that resolve conflict of laws. For example, just because \nA sues B in a Texas court, the Texas court will not necessarily apply Texas law. Anna \nand Bobby collide and suffer serious physical injuries while driving their cars in \nRoswell, New Mexico. Both live in Austin, and Bobby files a lawsuit in Austin. The \ncourt there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction \nover Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and \naccidents in New Mexico. Why would the Texas judge do that? \n(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make \na decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law \nstandards. For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the \nUniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court \ndecides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other. \nIn Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New \nMexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or \nhow much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies. Because both were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n96 \nunder the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New \nMexico law. \n(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court? \n(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or \nsympathetic to the “local” plaintiff. \n(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured \njudge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area). \n(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done? \n(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court. \n(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the \ncase unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy \nis less than $75,000. \n \n \nTo better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example. Wile E. Coyote wants a \nfederal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on \nstate law.

The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury.

As parties exchange information through various discovery methods like depositions, written interrogatories, and requests for documents, they gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their own and the opposing party's case. This increased knowledge often leads to more informed settlement discussions. In many cases, the sheer volume and cost of discovery can serve as a deterrent to proceeding to trial, as both parties might prefer to resolve the dispute through settlement rather than risking the uncertainty and expense of a trial. Furthermore, judges frequently use the discovery phase to encourage settlement by meeting with the parties and discussing the merits of their cases. This process can help identify areas of agreement and highlight the risks and costs associated with going to trial, thereby increasing the chances of a pretrial resolution. According to the text, approximately 85% of civil cases and over 90% of criminal cases end before trial due to successful settlements or guilty pleas, underscoring the significant impact of the discovery process on settlement rates."

            "chunk": "lawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause. For \nexample, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n112 \nprospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar \nproblem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney \ncould well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In that case, she could use \na challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion, \ncould either accept the for-cause reason or reject it. \n \nEven if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several \nperemptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow. A trial attorney with many years of \nexperience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide \nto use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel. \n \nAfter the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the \nnature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the \nlawyer will present. The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right \nto do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case. \n \nThe plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. \nThe direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The rules of evidence (that govern the \nkinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format \ntend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow. \n \nAnyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will \nappreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may \nor may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is \nasked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge. \n \nAfter direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This \nis a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment \n(the right to confront one’s accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n113 \nand the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem \nimmediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial.",

This process helps in identifying and eliminating jurors who might have preconceived notions or conflicts of interest that could affect their impartiality.

There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge. In \ncompiling a record on appeal, the appellant needs to show the appellate court some examples of mistakes \nmade by the judge—for example, having erroneously admitted evidence, having failed to admit proper \nevidence that should have been admitted, or having wrongly instructed the jury. The appellate court must \ndetermine if those mistakes were serious enough to amount to prejudicial error. \n \nAppellate and trial procedures are different. The appellate court does not hear witnesses or accept \nevidence. It reviews the record of the case—the transcript of the witnesses’ testimony and the documents \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n118 \nreceived into evidence at trial—to try to find a legal error on a specific request of one or both of the \nparties. The parties’ lawyers prepare briefs (written statements containing the facts in the case), the \nprocedural steps taken, and the argument or discussion of the meaning of the law and how it applies to \nthe facts. After reading the briefs on appeal, the appellate court may dispose of the appeal without \nargument, issuing a written opinion that may be very short or many pages. Often, though, the appellate \ncourt will hear oral argument. (This can be months, or even more than a year after the briefs are filed.) \nEach lawyer is given a short period of time, usually no more than thirty minutes, to present his client’s \ncase. The lawyer rarely gets a chance for an extended statement because he is usually interrupted by \nquestions from the judges. Through this exchange between judges and lawyers, specific legal positions can \nbe tested and their limits explored. \n \nDepending on what it decides, the appellate court will affirm the lower court’s \njudgment, modify it, reverse it, or remand it to the lower court for retrial or other action directed by the \nhigher court. The appellate court itself does not take specific action in the case; it sits only to rule on \ncontested issues of law. The lower court must issue the final judgment in the case. As we have already \nseen, there is the possibility of appealing from an intermediate appellate court to the state supreme court \nin twenty-nine states and to the US Supreme Court from a ruling from a federal circuit court of appeal. In \ncases raising constitutional issues, there is also the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Court from the \nstate courts. \n \nLike trial judges, appellate judges must follow previous decisions, or precedent. But not every previous \ncase is a precedent for every court. Lower courts must respect appellate court decisions, and courts in one \nstate are not bound by decisions of courts in other states. State courts are not bound by decisions of \nfederal courts, except on points of federal law that come from federal courts within the state or from a \nfederal circuit in which the state court sits. A state supreme court is not bound by case law in any other \nstate. But a supreme court in one state with a type of case it has not previously dealt with may find \npersuasive reasoning in decisions of other state supreme courts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n119 \nFederal district courts are bound by the decisions of the court of appeals in their circuit, but decisions by \none circuit court are not precedents for courts in other circuits. Federal courts are also bound by decisions \nof the state supreme courts within their geographic territory in diversity jurisdiction cases. All courts are \nbound by decisions of the US Supreme Court, except the Supreme Court itself, which seldom reverses \nitself but on occasion has overturned its own precedents. \n \nNot everything a court says in an opinion is a precedent. Strictly speaking, only the exact holding is \nbinding on the lower courts. A holding is the theory of the law that applies to the particular circumstances \npresented in a case. The courts may sometimes declare what they believe to be the law with regard to \npoints that are not central to the case being decided. These declarations are called dicta (the \nsingular, dictum), and the lower courts do not have to give them the same weight as holdings. \n \n \nJudgment and Order \nWhen a party has no more possible appeals, it usually pays up voluntarily.

            "chunk": "Article II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is \ncalled federalism. The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch. The basic power \nimbalance was between the large states (with greater population) and the smaller ones (such as \nDelaware). The smaller ones feared a loss of sovereignty if they could be outvoted by the larger ones, so \nthe federal legislature was constructed to guarantee two Senate seats for every state, no matter how small. \nThe Senate was also given great responsibility in ratifying treaties and judicial nominations. The net effect \nof this today is that senators from a very small number of states can block treaties and other important \nlegislation. The power of small states is also magnified by the Senate’s cloture rule, which currently \nrequires sixty out of one hundred senators to vote to bring a bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. \n \nBecause the Constitution often speaks in general terms (with broad phrases such as “due process” and \n“equal protection”), reasonable people have disagreed as to how those terms apply in specific cases. The \nUnited States is unique among industrialized democracies in having a Supreme Court that reserves for \nitself that exclusive power to interpret what the Constitution means. The famous case of Marbury v. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n143 \nMadison began that tradition in 1803, when the Supreme Court had marginal importance in the new \nrepublic. The decision in Bush v. Gore, decided in December of 2000, illustrates the power of the court to \nshape our destiny as a nation. In that case, the court overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court \nregarding the way to proceed on a recount of the Florida vote for the presidency. The court’s ruling was \npurportedly based on the “equal protection of the laws” provision in the Fourteenth Amendment. \n \nFrom Marbury to the present day, the Supreme Court has articulated the view that the US Constitution \nsets the framework for all other US laws, whether statutory or judicially created. Thus any statute (or \nportion thereof) or legal ruling (judicial or administrative) in conflict with the Constitution is not \nenforceable. And as the Bush v. Gore decision indicates, the states are not entirely free to do what they \nmight choose; their own sovereignty is limited by their union with the other states in a federal sovereign. \n \nIf the Supreme Court makes a “bad decision” as to what the Constitution means, it is not easily \noverturned. Either the court must change its mind (which it seldom does) or two-thirds of Congress and \nthree-fourths of the states must make an amendment (Article V). \n \nBecause the Supreme Court has this power of judicial review, there have been many arguments about how \nit should be exercised and what kind of “philosophy” a Supreme Court justice should have. President \nRichard Nixon often said that a Supreme Court justice should “strictly construe” the Constitution and not \nadd to its language. Finding law in the Constitution was “judicial activism” rather than “judicial restraint.” \nThe general philosophy behind the call for “strict constructionist” justices is that legislatures make laws in \naccord with the wishes of the majority, and so unelected judges should not make law according to their \nown views and values. Nixon had in mind the 1960s Warren court, which “found” rights in the \nConstitution that were not specifically mentioned—the right of privacy, for example. In later years, critics \nof the Rehnquist court would charge that it “found” rights that were not specifically mentioned, such as",

Additionally, the principle of judicial review, established through Marbury v. Madison, ensures that any statute or legal ruling in conflict with the Constitution is not enforceable, thereby limiting the powers of other branches of government. However, the Supreme Court's decisions are not easily overturned, requiring either a change in the court's opinion or a constitutional amendment, which underscores the enduring nature of its interpretations."

United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of \nlotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n148 \nfood and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement \nin prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] \n \nIn each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary \nto the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate \ntransportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of \ninterstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed!

Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, where the Court ruled that even modest impacts on interstate commerce could justify federal legislation. Specifically, the Court reversed earlier decisions that considered labor relations to have only an indirect effect on commerce, holding that the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining, a key aspect of labor rights, was 'an essential condition of industrial peace.' This decision allowed the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to regulate industrial activities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce, thereby justifying federal intervention in corporate practices that affected worker rights. This significant change marked a departure from the previous stance and paved the way for broader federal regulation in areas affecting interstate commerce."

Indeed, Ollie did not advertise \nnationally, or even regionally, and had customers only from the local area. But the court found that some \n42 percent of the supplies for Ollie’s restaurant had moved in the channels of interstate commerce. This \nwas enough to sustain federal regulation based on the commerce clause. [3] \n \nFor nearly thirty years following, it was widely assumed that Congress could almost always find some \ninterstate commerce connection for any law it might pass. It thus came as something of a shock in 1995 \nwhen the Rehnquist court decided U.S. v. Lopez. Lopez had been convicted under a federal law that \nprohibited possession of firearms within 1,000 feet of a school. The law was part of a twenty-year trend \n(roughly 1970 to 1990) for senators and congressmen to pass laws that were tough on crime. Lopez’s \nlawyer admitted that Lopez had had a gun within 1,000 feet of a San Antonio school yard but challenged \nthe law itself, arguing that Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in passing this \nlegislation. The US government’s Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Department of Justice to the \nSupreme Court that Congress was within its constitutional rights under the commerce clause because \neducation of the future workforce was the foundation for a sound economy and because guns at or near \nschool yards detracted from students’ education. The court rejected this analysis, noting that with the \ngovernment’s analysis, an interstate commerce connection could be conjured from almost anything. \nLopez went free because the law itself was unconstitutional, according to the court. \n \nCongress made no attempt to pass similar legislation after the case was decided. But in passing \nsubsequent legislation, Congress was often careful to make a record as to why it believed it was addressing \na problem that related to interstate commerce. In 1994, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA), having held hearings to establish why violence against women on a local level would impair \ninterstate commerce. In 1994, while enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Christy \nBrzonkala alleged that Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both students and varsity football players \nat Virginia Tech, had raped her. In 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against Morrison and Crawford \nunder Virginia Tech’s sexual assault policy. After a hearing, Morrison was found guilty of sexual assault \nand sentenced to immediate suspension for two semesters. Crawford was not punished. A second hearing \nagain found Morrison guilty. After an appeal through the university’s administrative system, Morrison’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n151 \npunishment was set aside, as it was found to be “excessive.” Ultimately, Brzonkala dropped out of the \nuniversity. Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA.

This ruling led to a decrease in similar legislation attempts by Congress and highlighted the need for lawmakers to provide a clear interstate commerce connection when passing such laws. Subsequently, Congress became more cautious about asserting its commerce clause powers, ensuring that there was a direct link between the legislation and interstate commerce. For instance, in 1994, when passing the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), Congress conducted hearings to demonstrate how violence against women at the local level could impede interstate commerce, thereby justifying the federal intervention."

The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that \nstated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to \nthe advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions \nwere preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of \nthe supremacy clause. Preemption can be express or implied. In cases where preemption is implied, the court \nusually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory \nscheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. For many years, the United States engaged in discussions with friendly nations as to the reciprocal use of \nports and harbors. These discussions led to various multilateral agreements between the nations as to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n162 \nconfiguration of oceangoing vessels and how they would be piloted. At the same time, concern over oil \nspills in Puget Sound led the state of Washington to impose fairly strict standards on oil tankers and \nrequirements for the training of oil tanker pilots. In addition, Washington’s state law imposed many other \nrequirements that went above and beyond agreed-upon requirements in the international agreements \nnegotiated by the federal government. Are the Washington state requirements preempted by federal law? \n2. The Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 requires that all contracts for arbitration be treated as any other \ncontract at common law. Suppose that the state of Alabama wishes to protect its citizens from a variety of \narbitration provisions that they might enter into unknowingly. Thus the legislation provides that all \npredispute arbitration clauses be in bold print, that they be of twelve-point font or larger, that they be \nclearly placed within the first two pages of any contract, and that they have a separate signature line where \nthe customer, client, or patient acknowledges having read, understood, and signed the arbitration clause in \naddition to any other signatures required on the contract. The legislation does preserve the right of \nconsumers to litigate in the event of a dispute arising with the product or service provider; that is, with this \nlegislation, consumers will not unknowingly waive their right to a trial at common law. Is the Alabama law \npreempted by the Federal Arbitration Act? \n \n  \n \n[1] Cippolone v.

Rudzewicz (Section 3.9 \n\"Cases\"). In that case, the court considered whether it was constitutionally correct for a court to assert \npersonal jurisdiction over a nonresident. The states cannot constitutionally award a judgment against a \nnonresident if doing so would offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Even if the \nstate’s long-arm statute would seem to allow such a judgment, other states should not give it full faith and \ncredit (see Article V of the Constitution). In short, a state’s long-arm statute cannot confer personal \njurisdiction that the state cannot constitutionally claim. \n \nThe Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was originally meant to apply to federal \nactions only. During the twentieth century, the court began to apply selected rights to state action as well. \nSo, for example, federal agents were prohibited from using evidence seized in violation of the Fourth \nAmendment, but state agents were not, until Mapp v.

It has been \nhis practice to raise a small acreage of winter wheat, sown in the Fall and harvested in the following July; \nto sell a portion of the crop; to feed part to poultry and livestock on the farm, some of which is sold; to use \nsome in making flour for home consumption; and to keep the rest for the following seeding. \n \nHis 1941 wheat acreage allotment was 11.1 acres and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat an acre. He \nsowed, however, 23 acres, and harvested from his 11.9 acres of excess acreage 239 bushels, which under \nthe terms of the Act as amended on May 26, 1941, constituted farm marketing excess, subject to a penalty \nof 49 cents a bushel, or $117.11 in all. \n \nThe general scheme of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 as related to wheat is to control the \nvolume moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the \nconsequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce. [T]he Secretary of \nAgriculture is directed to ascertain and proclaim each year a national acreage allotment for the next crop \nof wheat, which is then apportioned to the states and their counties, and is eventually broken up into \nallotments for individual farms. \nIt is urged that under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Article I, § 8, clause 3, Congress does not \npossess the power it has in this instance sought to exercise. The question would merit little consideration \nsince our decision in United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, sustaining the federal power to regulate \nproduction of goods for commerce, except for the fact that this Act extends federal regulation to \nproduction not intended in any part for commerce but wholly for consumption on the farm. \n \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \nKassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. \n450 U.S. 662 (U.S. Supreme Court 1981) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n179 \n \nJUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which JUSTICE \nWHITE, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS joined. \n \nThe question is whether an Iowa statute that prohibits the use of certain large trucks within the State \nunconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \n \nI \nAppellee Consolidated Freightways Corporation of Delaware (Consolidated) is one of the largest common \ncarriers in the country: it offers service in 48 States under a certificate of public convenience and necessity \nissued by the Interstate Commerce Commission. Among other routes, Consolidated carries commodities \nthrough Iowa on Interstate 80, the principal east-west route linking New York, Chicago, and the west \ncoast, and on Interstate 35, a major north-south route. \n \nConsolidated mainly uses two kinds of trucks. One consists of a three-axle tractor pulling a 40-foot two-\naxle trailer. This unit, commonly called a single, or “semi,” is 55 feet in length overall. Such trucks have \nlong been used on the Nation’s highways. Consolidated also uses a two-axle tractor pulling a single-axle \ntrailer which, in turn, pulls a single-axle dolly and a second single-axle trailer. This combination, known \nas a double, or twin, is 65 feet long overall. Many trucking companies, including Consolidated, \nincreasingly prefer to use doubles to ship certain kinds of commodities. Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways. Unlike all \nother States in the West and Midwest, Iowa generally prohibits the use of 65-foot doubles within its \nborders. \n \n… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n180 \nBecause of Iowa’s statutory scheme, Consolidated cannot use its 65-foot doubles to move commodities \nthrough the State. Instead, the company must do one of four things: (i) use 55-foot singles; (ii) use 60-foot \ndoubles; (iii) detach the trailers of a 65-foot double and shuttle each through the State separately; or (iv) \ndivert 65-foot doubles around Iowa. Dissatisfied with these options, Consolidated filed this suit in the \nDistrict Court averring that Iowa’s statutory scheme unconstitutionally burdens interstate commerce. \nIowa defended the law as a reasonable safety measure enacted pursuant to its police power. The State \nasserted that 65-foot doubles are more dangerous than 55-foot singles and, in any event, that the law \npromotes safety and reduces road wear within the State by diverting much truck traffic to other states. \n \nIn a 14-day trial, both sides adduced evidence on safety and on the burden on interstate commerce",

Consolidated Freightways Corp. case examines whether an Iowa statute prohibiting the use of certain large trucks within the state unduly burdens interstate commerce. Iowa restricted the length of vehicles on its highways, specifically banning 65-foot doubles, while other western and midwestern states allowed such lengths. Consolidated Freightways, a major carrier, sought to use 65-foot doubles on its routes through Iowa but was constrained by the state’s laws. The company faced several alternatives, including using shorter 55-foot singles, 60-foot doubles, or detaching trailers for separate transport, or rerouting around Iowa. Iowa justified its restrictions as a safety measure and argued that they reduced road wear and diverted traffic to other states. The case highlights the tension between state regulatory powers and the federal government's authority over interstate commerce, as the court must determine whether Iowa's regulations are permissible under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution."

As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections. The concern over backing \ncapability also is insignificant, because it seldom is necessary to back up on an interstate. In any event, no \nevidence suggested any difference in backing capability between the 60-foot doubles that Iowa permits \nand the 65-foot doubles that it bans. Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles. Another study, prepared by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the \nrequest of the state legislature, concluded that “[s]ixty-five foot twin trailer combinations have not been \nshown by experiences in other states to be less safe than 60-foot twin trailer \ncombinations or conventional tractor-semitrailers.” \n \nIn sum, although Iowa introduced more evidence on the question of safety than did Wisconsin \nin Raymond, the record as a whole was not more favorable to the State. \n \nB \nConsolidated, meanwhile, demonstrated that Iowa’s law substantially burdens interstate commerce. \nTrucking companies that wish to continue to use 65-foot doubles must route them around Iowa or detach \nthe trailers of the doubles and ship them through separately. Alternatively, trucking companies must use \nthe smaller 55-foot singles or 65-foot doubles permitted under Iowa law. Each of these options engenders \ninefficiency and added expense. The record shows that Iowa’s law added about $12.6 million each year to \nthe costs of trucking companies. \n \nConsolidated alone incurred about $2 million per year in increased costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n185 \n \nIn addition to increasing the costs of the trucking companies (and, indirectly, of the service to \nconsumers), Iowa’s law may aggravate, rather than, ameliorate, the problem of highway accidents. Fifty-\nfive-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles. Either more small trucks must be used to carry the \nsame quantity of goods through Iowa or the same number of larger trucks must drive longer distances to \nbypass Iowa. In either case, as the District Court noted, the restriction requires more highway miles to be \ndriven to transport the same quantity of goods. Other things being equal, accidents are proportional to \ndistance traveled. Thus, if 65-foot doubles are as safe as 55-foot singles, Iowa’s law tends to increase the \nnumber of accidents and to shift the incidence of them from Iowa to other States. \n \n[IV. Omitted] \nV \nIn sum, the statutory exemptions, their history, and the arguments Iowa has advanced in support of its \nlaw in this litigation all suggest that the deference traditionally accorded a State’s safety judgment is not \nwarranted. See Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 444-447. The controlling factors thus are the findings of \nthe District Court, accepted by the Court of Appeals, with respect to the relative safety of the types of \ntrucks at issue, and the substantiality of the burden on interstate commerce. \n \nBecause Iowa has imposed this burden without any significant countervailing safety interest, its statute \nviolates the Commerce Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. \n \nIt is so ordered. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Under the Constitution, what gives Iowa the right to make rules regarding the size or configuration of trucks \nupon highways within the state? \n2. Did Iowa try to exempt trucking lines based in Iowa, or was the statutory rule nondiscriminatory as to the \norigin of trucks that traveled on Iowa highways? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n186 \n3.

However, the significance of these characteristics is limited on modern interstate highways where passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic lanes and interstates have few, if any, intersections.

Lastly, while doubles tend to jackknife more often than singles, 65-foot doubles are actually less likely to jackknife compared to 60-foot doubles. Despite these advantages, statistical studies indicated that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe as 55-foot singles and 60-foot doubles, suggesting that the safety concerns raised against 65-foot doubles are largely unfounded."

                    "answer": "The case argues that Iowa's law imposing restrictions on the use of 65-foot doubles creates a substantial burden on interstate commerce. Specifically, trucking companies face increased costs due to the need to route around Iowa or detach trailers to ship through separately. These inefficiencies and additional expenses are estimated to add about $12.6 million annually to the costs of trucking companies, with Consolidated alone incurring approximately $2 million annually. Furthermore, the law may inadvertently lead to an increase in the number of accidents. Since 55-foot singles carry less freight than 65-foot doubles, either more small trucks must be used to transport the same quantity of goods through Iowa, or larger trucks must drive longer distances to bypass Iowa. Both scenarios result in more highway miles being driven to transport the same amount of goods, and given that accidents are proportional to distance traveled, the restriction would likely increase the total number of accidents, shifting the incidence of accidents from Iowa to other states. This outcome contradicts the stated goal of reducing highway accidents, thereby undermining the rationale behind the law."

The text argues that no sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations, and that the government may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker's corporate identity. This principle is highlighted by the example of the potential ban on the film 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' under the Austin ruling, which allowed for the suppression of political speech funded by a corporation that was critical of Members of Congress."

Constitution sets the framework for all other laws of the United States, at both the federal and the \nstate level. It creates a shared balance of power between states and the federal government (federalism) \nand shared power among the branches of government (separation of powers), establishes individual rights \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n200 \nagainst governmental action (Bill of Rights), and provides for federal oversight of matters affecting \ninterstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations. Knowing the contours of the US legal system is \nnot possible without understanding the role of the US Constitution. \n \nThe Constitution is difficult to amend. Thus when the Supreme Court uses its power of judicial review to \ndetermine that a law is unconstitutional, it actually shapes what the Constitution means. New meanings \nthat emerge must do so by the process of amendment or by the passage of time and new appointments to \nthe court. Because justices serve for life, the court changes its philosophical outlook slowly. \n \nThe Bill of Rights is an especially important piece of the Constitutional framework. It provides legal \ncauses of action for infringements of individual rights by government, state or federal. Through the due \nprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both procedural and (to some \nextent) substantive due process rights are given to individuals. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. For many years, the Supreme Court believed that “commercial speech” was entitled to less protection \nthan other forms of speech. One defining element of commercial speech is that its dominant theme is \nto propose a commercial transaction. This kind of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but the \ngovernment is permitted to regulate it more closely than other forms of speech. However, the \ngovernment must make reasonable distinctions, must narrowly tailor the rules restricting commercial \nspeech, and must show that government has a legitimate goal that the law furthers. \nEdward Salib owned a Winchell’s Donut House in Mesa, Arizona. To attract customers, he displayed \nlarge signs in store windows. The city ordered him to remove the signs because they violated the city’s \nsign code, which prohibited covering more than 30 percent of a store’s windows with signs. Salib sued, \nclaiming that the sign code violated his First Amendment rights. What was the result, and why? \n2. Jennifer is a freshman at her local public high school.

The employees of the US Treasury Department that work the border crossing between the United States \nand Mexico learned that they will be subject to routine drug testing.

Many border guards do not use drugs, have no intention of using \ndrugs, and object to the invasion of their privacy. What is the constitutional basis for their objection? \n4.

The necessity of such justifications implies that the government must provide substantial reasons to support the requirement, beyond mere speculation or general interest.

The implications of this classification for tax deductibility as business expenses are complex. While the Constitution protects corporate speech, it does not mandate that such expenses be tax-deductible. The decision to allow or prohibit such deductions typically falls under the purview of Congress and involves balancing the principles of free speech with broader economic and fiscal considerations. Some might argue that allowing tax deductions for political contributions could distort the political process, while others might contend that such deductions align with the spirit of free speech protections. Ultimately, the tax deductibility of these expenses remains a matter of legislative discretion within the constraints set by constitutional interpretations."

For example, after the \nReagan administration set aside a Carter administration rule from the National Highway Traffic and \nSafety Administration on passive restraints in automobiles, State Farm and other insurance companies \nchallenged the reversal as arbitrary and capricious. Examining the record, the Supreme Court found that \nthe agency had failed to state enough reasons for its reversal and required the agency to review the record \nand the rule and provide adequate reasons for its reversal. State Farm and other insurance companies \nthus gained a legal benefit by keeping an agency rule that placed costs on automakers for increased \npassenger safety and potentially reducing the number of injury claims from those it had insured. [1] \n \nSuing the Government \nIn the modern administrative state, the range of government activity is immense, and administrative \nagencies frequently get in the way of business enterprise. Often, bureaucratic involvement is wholly \nlegitimate, compelled by law; sometimes, however, agencies or government officials may overstep their \nbounds, in a fit of zeal or spite. What recourse does the private individual or company have? \n \nMainly for historical reasons, it has always been more difficult to sue the government than to sue private \nindividuals or corporations. For one thing, the government has long had recourse to the doctrine of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n226 \nsovereign immunity as a shield against lawsuits. Yet in 1976, Congress amended the Administrative \nProcedure Act to waive any federal claim to sovereign immunity in cases of injunctive or other \nnonmonetary relief. Earlier, in 1946, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had waived sovereign \nimmunity of the federal government for most tort claims for money damages, although the act contains \nseveral exceptions for specific agencies (e.g., one cannot sue for injuries resulting from fiscal operations of \nthe Treasury Department or for injuries stemming from activities of the military in wartime). The act also \ncontains a major exception for claims “based upon [an official’s] exercise or performance or the failure to \nexercise or perform a discretionary function or duty.” This exception prevents suits against parole boards \nfor paroling dangerous criminals who then kill or maim in the course of another crime and suits against \nofficials whose decision to ship explosive materials by public carrier leads to mass deaths and injuries \nfollowing an explosion en route. [2] \n \nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has been stripping away the traditional immunity enjoyed by many \ngovernment officials against personal suits. Some government employees—judges, prosecutors, \nlegislators, and the president, for example—have absolute immunity against suit for official actions. But \nmany public administrators and government employees have at best a qualified immunity. Under a \nprovision of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (so-called Section 1983 actions), state officials can be sued in \nfederal court for money damages whenever “under color of any state law” they deprive anyone of his \nrights under the Constitution or federal law. In Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, the \nSupreme Court held that federal agents may be sued for violating the plaintiff’s Fourth Amendment rights \nagainst an unlawful search of his home.[3] Subsequent cases have followed this logic to permit suits for \nviolations of other constitutional provisions. This area of the law is in a state of flux, and it is likely to \ncontinue to evolve. \n \nSometimes damage is done to an individual or business because the government has given out erroneous \ninformation. For example, suppose that Charles, a bewildered, disabled navy employee, is receiving a \nfederal disability annuity. Under the regulations, he would lose his pension if he took a job that paid him \nin each of two succeeding years more than 80 percent of what he earned in his old navy job.

The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v.

The Fourth Amendment speaks of “people” being secure in their “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” \nWhy would the Fourth Amendment apply to a business, which is not in a “house”? \n4. If the Fourth Amendment does not distinguish between closely regulated industries and those that are not, \nwhy does the court do so? \n \n \nAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan \nAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute v. Donovan \n452 U.S. 490 (1981) \n \nJUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nCongress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Act) “to assure so far as possible every \nworking man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions.…“The Act authorizes the \nSecretary of Labor to establish, after notice and opportunity to comment, mandatory nationwide \nstandards governing health and safety in the workplace. In 1978, the Secretary, acting through the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated a standard limiting occupational \nexposure to cotton dust, an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton \nproducts, exposure to which produces a “constellation of respiratory effects” known as “byssinosis.” This \ndisease was one of the expressly recognized health hazards that led to passage of the Act. \n \nPetitioners in these consolidated cases representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the \nvalidity of the “Cotton Dust Standard” in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \npursuant to § 6 (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655 (f).

Respondents, the Secretary of Labor and two labor \norganizations, counter that Congress balanced the costs and benefits in the Act itself, and that the Act \nshould therefore be construed not to require OSHA to do so. They interpret the Act as mandating that \nOSHA enact the most protective standard possible to eliminate a significant risk of material health \nimpairment, subject to the constraints of economic and technological feasibility. \n \nThe Court of Appeals held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits. \n \nWe granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 817 (1980), to resolve this important question, which was presented but",

                    "answer": "Barlow’s argues against the warrantless entry of government agents into their business premises. Specifically, the company asserts that the Fourth Amendment protects individuals and their property, including businesses, from unreasonable searches and seizures, even if the business is engaged in interstate commerce. Barlow’s contends that merely conducting a business that affects interstate commerce does not automatically grant government agents the right to enter and search the business without a warrant, especially when the entry is sought over the objection of the business owner. Additionally, Barlow’s emphasizes that the employees' ability to report violations does not justify warrantless searches by federal agents, as such searches are distinct from the inspections and reports that employees might make as part of their regular duties."

                    "answer": "The court differentiates between closely regulated industries and other businesses by recognizing that while closely regulated industries like those covered by the Walsh-Healey Act have historically been subject to more stringent oversight, this does not mean that all businesses involved in interstate commerce fall under the same level of regulation. The court argues that invoking the Walsh-Healey Act as a precedent for regulating all businesses is unconvincing because the act's provisions on minimum wages and maximum hours do not prepare the entirety of American interstate commerce for minute details of regulation. Furthermore, the court notes that the voluntary nature of subjecting oneself to regulation does not equate to a blanket acceptance of warrantless searches by government agents. It highlights that while the use of employees in a business operation does not inherently open up the entire business to public scrutiny, the presence of government agents without a warrant goes beyond what is reasonably expected in terms of privacy protections afforded by the Fourth Amendment. This distinction underscores that the Fourth Amendment applies to all businesses, regardless of their level of regulation, ensuring that all are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures."

According to \nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), “feasible” means \n“capable of being done, executed, or effected.” In accord, the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n235 \n(“Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out”); Funk & Wagnalls New “Standard” Dictionary of \nthe English Language 903 (1957) (“That may be done, performed or effected”). Thus, § 6(b)(5) directs the \nSecretary to issue the standard that “most adequately assures…that no employee will suffer material \nimpairment of health,” limited only by the extent to which this is “capable of being done.” In effect then, \nas the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits, by \nplacing the “benefit” of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this \n“benefit” unachievable. Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that \nstrikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth \nin § 6(b)(5). Thus, cost-benefit analysis by OSHA is not required by the statute because feasibility analysis \nis. \n \nWhen Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such \nintent on the face of the statute. One early example is the Flood Control Act of 1936, 33 U.S.C. § 701: \n \n[T]he Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters \nor their tributaries, including watersheds thereof, for flood control purposes if the benefits to \nwhomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and \nsocial security of people are otherwise adversely affected. (emphasis added) \nA more recent example is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, providing that \noffshore drilling operations shall use the best available and safest technologies which the Secretary \ndetermines to be economically feasible, wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on \nsafety, health, or the environment, except where the Secretary determines that the incremental benefits \nare clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such technologies. \n \nThese and other statutes demonstrate that Congress uses specific language when intending that an agency \nengage in cost-benefit analysis. Certainly in light of its ordinary meaning, the word “feasible” cannot be \nconstrued to articulate such congressional intent. We therefore reject the argument that Congress \nrequired cost-benefit analysis in § 6(b)(5). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n236 \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

This means that the Secretary is directed to issue the standard that most adequately assures no employee will suffer material impairment of health, but this is limited only by the extent to which this is capable of being done. This interpretation affects the role of cost-benefit analysis by OSHA because it implies that cost-benefit analysis is not required by the statute.

The Flood Control Act of 1936 specifically states that the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters for flood control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected. This indicates that Congress intended for the government to consider both benefits and costs. Similarly, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978 provide that offshore drilling operations shall use the best available and safest technologies which the Secretary determines to be economically feasible, wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment, except where the Secretary determines that the incremental benefits are clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such technologies. These examples show that when Congress intends that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it uses specific language to make this clear. Therefore, the absence of such specific language in § 6(b)(5) of the statute indicates that Congress did not require cost-benefit analysis but rather feasibility analysis."

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

However, when individuals agree to participate in certain activities like sports, they typically consent to abide by the rules of that activity, including the permissible physical contact.

                    "answer": "Larceny involves the unlawful taking and carrying away of someone else's personal property with the intent to permanently deprive them of it. The act of larceny requires the thief to take the property directly from the owner, such as walking away with a stolen bicycle. On the other hand, embezzlement occurs when a person who is in lawful possession of property, usually due to their position of trust, misappropriates it for their own use. This can happen in scenarios where someone is entrusted with property temporarily, like an automobile mechanic keeping a customer's car or a bank teller taking money from the cash drawer. Modern statutes have addressed these offenses by explicitly defining them and creating specific penalties. For instance, embezzlement is now recognized as a statutory offense in all states, providing clearer legal boundaries and consequences for such actions."

A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat \ncommonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him. \n \nOffenses against Habitation and Other Offenses \nBurglary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n250 \nBurglary is not a crime against property. It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead?

Under Section (a)(1), obtaining national security information is punishable with a maximum of 10 years (20 years for a second offense). Section (a)(3) deals with trespassing in a government computer, carrying a penalty of 1 year (5 years for a second offense). Compromising the confidentiality of a computer falls under Section (a)(2) and carries a penalty of 1 year (10 years for a second offense). Accessing a computer to defraud and obtain value is addressed in Section (a)(4), with a penalty of 5 years (10 years for a second offense). Section (a)(5)(A)(ii) covers intentional access and reckless damage, which can result in a sentence of 5 years (20 years for a second offense). Lastly, trafficking in passwords is governed by Section (a)(6), with a penalty of 1 year (10 years for a second offense).

                    "question": "Can a person be considered guilty of a criminal act without performing an actual criminal action, and under what circumstances?",
                    "answer": "Yes, a person can be considered guilty of a criminal act without performing an actual criminal action. This concept is known as 'attempt' in criminal law. An attempt occurs when a person takes a substantial step towards committing a crime with the specific intent to complete it, even if the crime is not ultimately completed. For instance, Brett pointing a gun at Ashley with the intent to shoot her would constitute an attempt to murder, regardless of whether he successfully hits her. However, the determination of whether a defendant's actions amount to an attempt rather than mere preparation is often complex and left to the discretion of the jury. Courts generally require that the defendant has passed beyond mere preparation and has taken an actual step toward perpetrating the crime. For example, snapping a gun into a shoulder holster after preparing to shoot would likely be seen as an attempt, whereas simply preparing the gun without taking that final step would not. Additionally, factual impossibility, where the crime cannot be committed due to external factors (e.g., the victim being dead), is typically not a valid defense for an attempt. Legal impossibility, where the act is not illegal, can serve as a valid defense."

Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor. In the fifty states, prosecution is a \nfunction of the district attorney’s office. These offices are usually organized on a county-by-county \nbasis. In the federal system, criminal prosecution is handled by the office of the US attorney, one of \nwhom is appointed for every federal district. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n263 \nFollowing the preliminary hearing, the prosecutor must either file an information (a document \nstating the crime of which the person being held is accused) or ask the grand jury for \nan indictment. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who sit to determine whether there is \nsufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution. It does not sit to determine guilt or innocence. The \nindictment is the grand jury’s formal declaration of charges on which the accused will be tried. If \nindicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant. \n \nThe defendant will then be arraigned, that is, brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the \nindictment. The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety.

He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating \nthe situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the \ncorrective action to reply to the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] \ncould have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.” \n \nOn cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to \nthe public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company” and he \nstated that it was one of many phases of the company that he assigned to “dependable subordinates.” \nRespondent was asked about and, over the objections of his counsel, admitted receiving, the April 1970 \nletter addressed to him from the FDA regarding insanitary conditions at Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. \nHe acknowledged that, with the exception of the division vice president, the same individuals had \nresponsibility for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia. Finally, in response to questions \nconcerning the Philadelphia and Baltimore incidents, respondent admitted that the Baltimore problem \nindicated the system for handling sanitation “wasn’t working perfectly” and that as Acme’s chief executive \nofficer he was “responsible for any result which occurs in our company.” \n \nAt the close of the evidence, respondent’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. The \nrelevant portion of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury challenged by respondent is set out in the \nmargin. Respondent’s counsel objected to the instructions on the ground that they failed fairly to reflect \nour decision in United States v. Dotterweich supra, and to define “‘responsible relationship.’” The trial \njudge overruled the objection. The jury found respondent guilty on all counts of the information, and he \nwas subsequently sentenced to pay a fine of $50 on each count.

In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to \nthe corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate \ncommerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general \nmanager. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that only the drug dealer, whether \ncorporation or individual, was subject to the criminal provisions of the Act, and that where the dealer was \na corporation, an individual connected therewith might be held personally only if he was operating the \ncorporation as his ‘alter ego.’ \n \nIn reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court \nlooked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of people \nwhich, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. It observed that \nthe Act is of “a now familiar type” which “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal \nconduct-awareness of some wrongdoing: In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at \nhazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

Employers can be held liable for the actions of their employees in all three scenarios, particularly in cases of negligent torts where the employer may be seen as having a duty of care towards third parties. However, in intentional torts, the employer might be less directly responsible unless they directed or authorized the employee's actions, while in strict liability torts, the employer's liability may depend on whether they had control over the conditions that led to the incident."

One is the fault dimension. Like criminal law, \ntort law requires a wrongful act by a defendant for the plaintiff to recover. Unlike criminal law, however, \nthere need not be a specific intent. Since tort law focuses on injury to the plaintiff, it is less concerned than \ncriminal law about the reasons for the defendant’s actions. An innocent act or a relatively innocent one \nmay still provide the basis for liability. Nevertheless, tort law—except for strict liability—relies on \nstandards of fault, or blameworthiness. \n \nThe most obvious standard is willful conduct. If the defendant (often called the tortfeasor—i.e., the one \ncommitting the tort) intentionally injures another, there is little argument about tort liability. Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault. They are based, rather, on negligent conduct that in the \ncircumstances is careless or poses unreasonable risks of causing damage. Most automobile accident and \nmedical malpractice suits are examples of negligence suits. \n \nThe fault dimension is a continuum. At one end is the deliberate desire to do injury. The middle ground is \noccupied by careless conduct. At the other end is conduct that most would consider entirely blameless, in \nthe moral sense. The defendant may have observed all possible precautions and yet still be held liable. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n285 \nThis is called strict liability. An example is that incurred by the manufacturer of a defective product that \nis placed on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality-control inspection. In many \nstates, if the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable. \n \nDimensions of Tort: Nature of Injury \nTort liability varies by the type of injury caused. The most obvious type is physical harm to the person \n(assault, battery, infliction of emotional distress, negligent exposure to toxic pollutants, wrongful death) \nor property (trespass, nuisance, arson, interference with contract). Mental suffering can be redressed if it \nis a result of physical injury (e.g., shock and depression following an automobile accident). A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other. Still another excuse is consent: two \nboxers in the ring consent to being struck with fists (but not to being bitten on the ear). \n \nDamages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n286 \nSince the purpose of tort law is to compensate the victim for harm actually done, damages are usually \nmeasured by the extent of the injury. Expressed in money terms, these include replacement of property \ndestroyed, compensation for lost wages, reimbursement for medical expenses, and dollars that are \nsupposed to approximate the pain that is suffered. Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations.

                    "answer": "Strict liability in tort law applies when a defendant is held liable regardless of fault or intent. Unlike the fault-based approach, strict liability focuses on the outcome rather than the defendant's state of mind. This means that even if a defendant has taken all possible precautions, they can still be held liable if their actions cause harm. An example of strict liability is the manufacturer of a defective product that places it on the market despite all possible precautions, including quality control inspections. If the product causes injury, the manufacturer will be held liable under strict liability rules. This concept is particularly relevant in industries where products pose inherent risks, such as manufacturing or chemical production, and ensures that victims of accidents can seek compensation without having to prove negligence or intent."

Unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are \ntaxable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are three kinds of torts, and in two of them (negligent torts and strict liability torts), damages are \nusually limited to making the victim whole through an enforceable judgment for money damages. These \ncompensatory damages awarded by a court accomplish only approximate justice for the injuries or property \ndamage caused by a tortfeasor. Tort laws go a step further toward deterrence, beyond compensation to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n287 \nplaintiff, in occasionally awarding punitive damages against a defendant. These are almost always in cases \nwhere an intentional tort has been committed. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is deterrence needed for intentional torts (where punitive damages are awarded) rather than \nnegligent torts? \n2. Why are costs imposed on others without their consent problematic for a market economy? What if the \nlaw did not try to reimpose the victim’s costs onto the tortfeasor? What would a totally nonlitigious society \nbe like? \n \n \n \n \n7.2 Intentional Torts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Distinguish intentional torts from other kinds of torts. \n2. Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

                    "question": "Why are compensatory damages awarded in tort cases, and how do they differ from punitive damages?",
                    "answer": "Compensatory damages are awarded in tort cases to make the victim whole by providing monetary compensation for the injuries or property damage caused by a tortfeasor. These damages aim to approximate justice and cover losses such as replacement of destroyed property, lost wages, medical expenses, and the suffering endured due to the tort. Compensatory damages are designed to restore the victim to the position they were in before the tort occurred. On the other hand, punitive damages are awarded in certain instances where the defendant's actions are deemed particularly egregious or malicious. Unlike compensatory damages, which are meant to compensate the victim, punitive damages are intended to punish the defendant and deter similar future behavior. Punitive damages are rarely awarded in negligence cases, as those typically involve unintentional harm, but they are more common in cases involving intentional torts where the defendant acted with malice or outrageous conduct. The amount of punitive damages is often left to the discretion of the jury and judge, and unlike compensatory damages, punitive damages are taxable."

                    "question": "What distinguishes intentional torts from negligent torts and strict liability torts, and why might punitive damages be awarded in cases of intentional torts?",
                    "answer": "Intentional torts are distinguished from negligent torts and strict liability torts primarily by the defendant's state of mind. In intentional torts, the defendant acts with the specific intent to cause harm or to perform an act that they know will likely cause harm. This contrasts with negligent torts, where the harm is unintended, and the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care, and strict liability torts, where the defendant is held liable regardless of fault or intent. In cases of intentional torts, punitive damages may be awarded because the defendant's actions are considered particularly egregious and malicious. The purpose of punitive damages is to punish the defendant for their wrongdoing and to deter similar future conduct. Unlike compensatory damages, which aim to restore the victim to their pre-tort state, punitive damages are intended to impose additional financial penalties on the defendant to send a strong message about the seriousness of their actions. This distinction is important because it reflects the different legal principles and goals behind compensatory and punitive damages in tort cases."

            "chunk": "damages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted \nTexaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution \nMalicious prosecution is the tort of causing someone to be prosecuted for a criminal act, knowing that \nthere was no probable cause to believe that the plaintiff committed the crime. The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

This is challenging because the law favors litigation as a means to vindicate legal rights, and plaintiffs must overcome this presumption, making it a heavy burden to prove."

Accurate accounts of judicial or other proceedings are \nabsolutely privileged; a newspaper, for example, may pass on the slanderous comments of a judge in \ncourt. “Judicial” is broadly construed to include most proceedings of administrative bodies of the \ngovernment. The Constitution exempts members of Congress from suits for libel or slander for any \nstatements made in connection with legislative business. The courts have constructed a similar privilege \nfor many executive branch officials. \n \nQualified Privilege \nAbsolute privileges pertain to those in the public sector. A narrower privilege exists for private citizens. In \ngeneral, a statement that would otherwise be actionable is held to be justified if made in a reasonable \nmanner and for a reasonable purpose. Thus you may warn a friend to beware of dealing with a third \nperson, and if you had reason to believe that what you said was true, you are privileged to issue the \nwarning, even though false. Likewise, an employee may warn an employer about the conduct or character \nof a fellow or prospective employee, and a parent may complain to a school board about the competence \nor conduct of a child’s teacher. There is a line to be drawn, however, and a defendant with nothing but an \nidle interest in the matter (an “officious intermeddler”) must take the risk that his information is wrong. \n \nIn 1964, the Supreme Court handed down its historic decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, holding \nthat under the First Amendment a libel judgment brought by a public official against a newspaper cannot \nstand unless the plaintiff has shown “actual malice,” which in turn was defined as “knowledge that [the \nstatement] was false or with a reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”[4] In subsequent cases, the \ncourt extended the constitutional doctrine further, applying it not merely to government officials but \nto public figures, people who voluntarily place themselves in the public eye or who involuntarily find \nthemselves the objects of public scrutiny. Whether a private person is or is not a public figure is a difficult \nquestion that has so far eluded rigorous definition and has been answered only from case to case. A CEO \nof a private corporation ordinarily will be considered a private figure unless he puts himself in the public \neye—for example, by starring in the company’s television commercials. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n295 \n \nInvasion of Privacy \nThe right of privacy—the right “to be let alone”—did not receive judicial recognition until the twentieth \ncentury, and its legal formulation is still evolving. In fact there is no single right of privacy. Courts and \ncommentators have discerned at least four different types of interests: (1) the right to control the \nappropriation of your name and picture for commercial purposes, (2) the right to be free of intrusion on \nyour “personal space” or seclusion, (3) freedom from public disclosure of embarrassing and intimate facts \nof your personal life, and (4) the right not to be presented in a “false light.” \n \nAppropriation of Name or Likeness \nThe earliest privacy interest recognized by the courts was appropriation of name or likeness: someone else \nplacing your photograph on a billboard or cereal box as a model or using your name as endorsing a \nproduct or in the product name. A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country. Deciding what “commercial” or \n“trade” purposes are is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its",

Tort law has had a significant impact on business because modern \ntechnology poses significant dangers and the modern market is so efficient at distributing goods to a wide \nclass of consumers. \n \nUnlike criminal law, tort law does not require the tortfeasor to have a specific intent to commit the act for \nwhich he or she will be held liable to pay damages. Negligence—that is, carelessness—is a major factor in \ntort liability. In some instances, especially in cases involving injuries caused by products, a no-fault \nstandard called strict liability is applied. \n \nWhat constitutes a legal injury depends very much on the circumstances. A person can assume a risk or \nconsent to the particular action, thus relieving the person doing the injury from tort liability. To be liable, \nthe tortfeasor must be the proximate cause of the injury, not a remote cause. On the other hand, certain \npeople are held to answer for the torts of another—for example, an employer is usually liable for the torts \nof his employees, and a bartender might be liable for injuries caused by someone to whom he sold too \nmany drinks. Two types of statutes—workers’ compensation and no-fault automobile insurance—have \neliminated tort liability for certain kinds of accidents and replaced it with an immediate insurance \npayment plan. \n \nAmong the torts of particular importance to the business community are wrongful death and personal \ninjury caused by products or acts of employees, misrepresentation, defamation, and interference with \ncontractual relations. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n325 \n1.

As the train rounds the \nbend, the engineer is distracted by a conductor and does not see the car until it is too late to stop. Who is \nnegligent? Who must bear the liability for the damage to the car and to the train? \n4. Suppose in the Katko v.

Pyrodyne, as the distributor, could still be held strictly liable for the injuries caused by its product, regardless of the manufacturer's negligence. Additionally, Klein may also consider pursuing claims against other parties involved in the supply chain, such as transportation companies or storage facilities, depending on their roles and responsibilities in the distribution process. This is because strict liability focuses on the final product reaching the consumer rather than the initial manufacturing defects. Therefore, Klein has multiple avenues for seeking redress, including the Chinese manufacturer, Pyrodyne, and potentially other intermediaries."

Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner \nthat is important to business. The parties create contract duties through a bargaining process. The \nkey element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the \nfreedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

Understand some fundamental contract taxonomy and terminology. \n \n \nThe Role of Contract in Society \nContract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to a deeply held \nconviction about the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that",

Specifically, the court of appeals should evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to support these claims, ensuring that the dismissal was appropriate under applicable law.

It requires mutual assent, consideration, legality, and capacity. Contrary to common usage where 'contract' may be used interchangeably with 'agreement,' 'bargain,' 'undertaking,' or 'deal,' a legal contract is specifically characterized by its enforceability and the presence of these essential elements. While agreements can exist without being contracts, a contract is a formalized agreement that is recognized by law and can be enforced through legal remedies if breached."

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

It is not a contract in the traditional sense, but rather a fiction created by the courts. For instance, suppose a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired him to repair your porch, and in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. The carpenter proceeds to work on your porch without being paid. Although there is no actual contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work done, to ensure that the carpenter is not unjustly enriched at your expense. Thus, even though there was no formal agreement, the law recognizes a quasi-contract to rectify the situation."

(However, if Pete is holding collateral as security for the debt, he is \nentitled to keep it; not all rights are extinguished because a contract is unenforceable.) \n \nDegree of Completion \nIn medieval England, contract—defined as set of promises—was not an intuitive concept. The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed. A \ncontract that has been carried out fully by both parties is called an executed contract. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAYS \n \nContract is the mechanism by which people in modern society make choices for themselves, as opposed to \nbeing born or placed into a status as is common in feudal societies. A contract is a legally enforceable promise. \nThe law of contract is the common law (for contracts involving real estate and services), statutory law (the \nUniform Commercial Code for contract involving the sale or leasing of goods), and treaty law (the Convention \non the International Sale of Goods). Contracts may be described based on the degree of their explicitness, \nmutuality, enforceability, and degree of completion. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n340 \n1.

Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach. The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law.

Baxendale case, the Court of Exchequer ruled that Joseph Baxendale, managing director of Pickford, was not liable for the profits lost by the Hadleys because the delay in delivering the shaft was not a foreseeable consequence of his breach. This decision laid down the rule that the extent of liability for damages in the event of a breach of contract is limited to those losses that were reasonably foreseeable at the time the contract was made."

Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other. Therefore, only \nto the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be \nawarded restitution. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n354 \nIf the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the \nrestitution interest. Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages.

Lucy, complainants, against A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. \nZehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of a contract by which it was alleged the \nZehmers had sold to W. O. Lucy a tract of land owned by A. H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing \n471.6 acres, more or less, known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000. J. C. Lucy, the other complainant, is \na brother of W. O. Lucy, to whom W. O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged purchase. \n \nThe instrument sought to be enforced was written by A. H. Zehmer on December 20, 1952, in these words: \n“We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to \nbuyer,” and signed by the defendants, A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer. \n \nThe answer of A. H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W. O. Lucy offered him $50,000 cash \nfor the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he \nand Lucy having had several drinks, he wrote out “the memorandum” quoted above and induced his wife \nto sign it; that he did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it in his \npocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused to accept, and realizing \nfor the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him that he had no intention of selling the farm \nand that the whole matter was a joke. Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.… \n \nIn his testimony Zehmer claimed that he “was high as a Georgia pine,” and that the transaction “was just a \nbunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most.” That claim is \ninconsistent with his attempt to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done.… \n \nIf it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer was jesting about selling his \nfarm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows \nthat Lucy did not so understand it but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract \nto be binding on the Zehmers as well as on himself. The very next day he arranged with his brother to put \nup half the money and take a half interest in the land. The day after that he employed an attorney to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n357 \nexamine the title. The next night, Tuesday, he was back at Zehmer’s place and there Zehmer told him for \nthe first time, Lucy said, that he wasn’t going to sell and he told Zehmer, “You know you sold that place",

                    "answer": "When choosing between suing for malpractice under tort law versus breach of warranty under contract law, several factors need to be considered. First, the statute of limitations differs between the two legal theories, with most statutes of limitations prescribing longer periods for contract actions compared to tort actions. Second, allowable damages vary between the two theories, with punitive damages being more frequently permitted in tort actions and certain types of injuries, such as pain and suffering, being compensable in tort but not in contract suits. Third, the role of expert testimony can differ, although it is generally similar in both tort and contract cases. However, in some contract cases, the use of an expert witness might be unnecessary, particularly in cases where the breach is straightforward, like abandonment. Lastly, insurance coverage plays a crucial role, as most policies do not cover intentional torts, making a contract theory that avoids the element of willfulness a safer option for the plaintiff seeking monetary damages."

                    "answer": "The primary purpose of remedies in contract law is to put the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had there been no breach. This is achieved through various forms of compensation, including compensatory damages, which encompass incidental and nominal damages, designed to directly address the losses incurred due to the breach. Additionally, in egregious and intentional breaches, punitive damages may be awarded to punish the breaching party. While compensatory damages aim to restore the injured party to their pre-breach position, punitive damages serve a different purpose by aiming to deter future wrongful behavior and impose additional penalties on the breaching party. This distinction highlights that compensatory damages focus on restitution, whereas punitive damages are more about deterrence and punishment."

In addition, Huyffer testified that EBWS would pay its employees during \nthe closure even though EBWS has no written contract to pay its employees when they are not working. \nThe trial court allowed these elements of damages to be submitted to the jury, and the jury awarded \nEBWS consequential damages for unused milk and staff wages. \n \nOn appeal, Britly contends that because there is no contractual or legal obligation for EBWS to purchase \nmilk or pay its employees, these are not foreseeable damages. EBWS counters that it is common \nknowledge that cows continue to produce milk, even if the processing plant is not working, and thus it is \nforeseeable that this loss would occur. We conclude that these damages are not the foreseeable result of \nBritly’s breach of the construction contract and reverse the award.… \n \n[W]e conclude that…it is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee that its failure to perform under the \ncontract would result in this type of damages. While we are sympathetic to EBWS’s contention that the \ncows continue to produce milk, even when the plant is closed down, this fact alone is not enough to \ndemonstrate that buying and dumping milk is a foreseeable result of Britly’s breach of the construction \ncontract. Here, the milk was produced by a separate and distinct entity, Rock Bottom Farm, which sold \nthe milk to EBWS.… \n \nSimilarly, EBWS maintained no employment agreements with its employees obligating it to pay wages \nduring periods of closure for repairs, dips in market demand, or for any other reason. Any losses EBWS \nmight suffer in the future because it chooses to pay its employees during a plant closure for repairs would \nbe a voluntary expense and not in Britly’s contemplation at the time it entered the construction contract. \nIt is not reasonable to expect Britly to foresee losses incurred as a result of agreements that are informal in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n364 \nnature and carry no legal obligation on EBWS to perform. “[P]arties are not presumed to know the \ncondition of each other’s affairs nor to take into account contracts with a third party that is not \ncommunicated.” [Citation] While it is true that EBWS may have business reasons to pay its employees \neven without a contractual obligation, for example, to ensure employee loyalty, no evidence was \nintroduced at trial by EBWS to support a sound rationale for such considerations. Under these \ncircumstances, this business decision is beyond the scope of what Britly could have reasonably foreseen as \ndamages for its breach of contract.… \n \nIn addition, the actual costs of the wages and milk are uncertain.…[T]he the milk and wages here are \nfuture expenses, for which no legal obligation was assumed by EBWS, and which are separate from the \nterms of the parties’ contract. We note that at the time of the construction contract EBWS had not yet \nbegun to operate as a creamery and had no history of buying milk or paying employees. See [Citation] \n(explaining that profits for a new business are uncertain and speculative and not recoverable). Thus, both \nthe cost of the milk and the number and amount of wages of future employees that EBWS might pay in \nthe event of a plant closure for repairs are uncertain. \n \nAward for consequential damages is reversed.… \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why, according to EBWS’s CEO, would EBWS be required to purchase milk from adjacent Rock Bottom \nFarm, even though it could not process this milk? \n2. Surely it is well known in Vermont dairy country that dairy farmers can’t simply stop milking cows when no \nprocessing plant is available to take the milk—the cows will soon stop producing. Why was EBWS then not \nentitled to those damages which it will certainly suffer when the creamery is down for repairs? \n3. Britly (the contractor) must have known EBWS had employees that would be idled when the creamery shut \ndown for repairs. Why was it not liable for their lost wages? \n4. What could EBWS have done at the time of contracting to protect itself against the damages it would incur \nin the event the creamery suffered downtime due to faulty construction? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n365 \n \n \n \n \n8.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nIn this chapter we have seen that two fundamental sources of contract law are the common law as \ndeveloped in the state courts and as summarized in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and the \nUniform Commercial Code for the sale of goods. \n \nSales law is a special type of contract law, governed by Article 2 of the UCC.

These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant. Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not \nalways easy; there is no single factor or mechanical answer. In Robinson v. New York Commodities Corp., \nan injured salesman sought workers’ compensation benefits, claiming to be an employee of the New York \nCommodities Corporation. [2] But the state workmen’s compensation board ruled against him, citing a \nvariety of factors. The claimant sold canned meats, making rounds in his car from his home. The company \ndid not establish hours for him, did not control his movements in any way, and did not reimburse him for \nmileage or any other expenses or withhold taxes from its straight commission payments to him. He \nreported his taxes on a form for the self-employed and hired an accountant to prepare it for him. The \ncourt agreed with the compensation board that these facts established the salesman’s status as an \nindependent contractor. \n \nThe factual situation in each case determines whether a worker is an employee or an independent \ncontractor. Neither the company nor the worker can establish the worker’s status by agreement. As the \nNorth Dakota Workmen’s Compensation Bureau put it in a bulletin to real estate brokers, “It has come to \nthe Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from",

This means that the principal can be held liable for the actions of the subagent, even though the subagent is under the direct control of the agent. The agent typically agrees to be primarily liable for the subagent's conduct, but the principal remains secondarily liable.

                    "answer": "The law distinguishes between an agent and an independent contractor based on the level of control the principal has over the worker's activities. An agent is controlled by the principal in terms of the physical conduct of their work, while an independent contractor is not subject to such control. Key factors in determining this distinction include the degree of control, the method of payment, the nature of the work, and the relationship between the parties. For instance, an independent contractor typically sets their own working hours, reports their own taxes, and provides their own tools and equipment. In contrast, an employee or agent usually works set hours, is paid a salary or hourly wage, and uses the employer's tools and equipment. Additionally, an employer is generally responsible for withholding taxes and providing benefits for employees, whereas independent contractors are responsible for their own taxes and benefits. Courts often consider these factors when deciding the status of a worker, and there is no single factor that can definitively determine the classification."

If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. There are, however, a few situations in which \nthe capacity of the agent is important. Thus a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal. \n \nAgency Created by Operation of Law \nMost agencies are made by contract, but agency also may arise impliedly or apparently. \n \nImplied Agency \nIn areas of social need, courts have declared an agency to exist in the absence of an agreement. The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing \nthe dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt. \n \nImplied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that \nthe “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent. Such are the \nbasic facts in Weingart v. Directoire Restaurant, Inc. in Section 9.3.1 \"Creation of Agency: Liability of \nParent for Contracts Made by “Agent” Child\". \n \nApparent Agency \nSuppose Arthur is Paul’s agent, employed through October 31. On November 1, Arthur buys materials at \nLumber Yard—as he has been doing since early spring—and charges them to Paul’s account. Lumber Yard, \nnot knowing that Arthur’s employment terminated the day before, bills Paul. Will Paul have to pay? Yes, \nbecause the termination of the agency was not communicated to Lumber Yard. It appeared that Arthur \nwas an authorized agent. This issue is discussed further in Chapter 10 \"Liability of Principal and Agent; \nTermination of Agency\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n381 \nAn agent is one who acts on behalf of another. Many transactions are conducted by agents so acting. All \ncorporate transactions, including those involving governmental organizations, are so conducted because \ncorporations cannot themselves actually act; they are legal fictions. Agencies may be created expressly, \nimpliedly, or apparently. Recurring issues in agency law include whether the “agent” really is such, the scope \nof the agent’s authority, and the duties among the parties. The five types of agents include: general agent, \nspecial agent, subagent, agency coupled with an interest, and servant (or employee).

Understand that the agent owes the principal two types of duties: a special duty—the fiduciary duty—and \nother general duties as recognized in agency law. \n2. Recognize that the principal owes the agent duties: contract, tort, and workers’ compensation. \n \n \nAgent’s Duty to Principal \nThe agent owes the principal duties in two categories: the fiduciary duty and a set of general duties \nimposed by agency law. But these general duties are not unique to agency law; they are duties owed by any \nemployee to the employer. \n \nFiduciary Duty \nIn a nonagency contractual situation, the parties’ responsibilities terminate at the border of the contract. \nThere is no relationship beyond the agreement. This literalist approach is justified by the more general \nprinciple that we each should be free to act unless we commit ourselves to a particular course.",

                    "answer": "A contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. Generally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the contract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent. However, there are situations in which the capacity of the agent is important, such as when a mentally incompetent agent cannot bind a principal."

                    "answer": "In areas of social need, courts have declared an agency to exist in the absence of an agreement, a concept known as an 'implied agency by operation of law.' For instance, children in most states may purchase necessary items—such as food or medical services—on the parent's account. This is based on long-standing social policy that deems it desirable for the head of a family to support his dependents. The courts will put the expense on the family head to provide for the dependents' welfare by supposing the dependent to be the family head's agent, thereby allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt."

But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars. A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized \nThis duty states a truism but is one for which there are limits. A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp. These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its",

In the Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp case, after the expiration of Sharp's employment contract, he continued to develop new products and machinery in the company's plants. Despite not having a new contract concerning rights to inventions, the court applied the 'shop rights' doctrine and ruled that the company owned the patent rights to these inventions since they were developed using the company's time, materials, and appliances. This decision underscores the doctrine's application in situations where inventions are created within the company's premises and with its resources, even after the termination of the original employment contract."

If the loss is partial (like partial loss of sight), the recovery is decreased \nby the percentage still usable. \n \nCoverage \nAlthough workers’ compensation laws are on the books of every state, in two states—New Jersey and \nTexas—they are not compulsory. In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

                    "answer": "In New Jersey and Texas, workers' compensation laws are not compulsory, meaning that employers may choose whether to participate in the system. If an employer decides not to participate, the employee must seek compensation through the courts, which can be challenging. However, even in states where the employer has the option to opt out, common-law defenses such as the fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk have been eliminated by statute. This makes it easier for employees to win cases, incentivizing employers to opt into workers' compensation coverage. Therefore, the enforcement mechanism involves both voluntary participation and the potential for legal action against non-participating employers."

We just let it hang and I told this Buster, \nBuster was his name, that you are a free agent and you do whatever you want to do. I am \ntending bar in the place and what you do in the street is up to you, I will not stop you, but we are \nnot hiring you or anything like that, because at that time, we didn’t know what we were going to \nuse the parking lot or get a doorman and put on a uniform or what. \n \nThese facts establish to the court’s satisfaction that, although Douglas was not an actual employee of the \nrestaurant, defendant held him out as its authorized agent or “employee” for the purpose of parking its \ncustomers’ cars, by expressly consenting to his standing, in uniform, in front of its door to receive \ncustomers, to park their cars and issue receipts therefor—which services were rendered without charge to \nthe restaurant’s customers, except for any gratuity paid to Douglas. Clearly, under these circumstances, \napparent authority has been shown and Douglas acted within the scope of this authority. \n \nPlaintiff was justified in assuming that Douglas represented the restaurant in providing his services and \nthat the restaurant had placed him there for the convenience of its customers. A restaurateur knows that \nthis is the impression created by allowing a uniformed attendant to so act. Facility in parking is often a \ncritical consideration for a motorist in selecting a restaurant in midtown Manhattan, and the Directoire \nwas keenly aware of this fact as evidenced by its testimony that the management was looking into various \nother possibilities for solving customers’ parking problems. \n \nThere was no suitable disclaimer posted outside the restaurant that it had no parking facilities or that \nentrusting one’s car to any person was at the driver’s risk. It is doubtful that any prudent driver would \nentrust his car to a strange person on the street, if he thought that the individual had no authorization \nfrom the restaurant or club or had no connection with it, but was merely an independent operator with \nquestionable financial responsibility. \n \nThe fact that Douglas received no compensation directly from defendant is not material. Each party \nderived a benefit from the arrangement: Douglas being willing to work for gratuities from customers, and \nthe defendant, at no cost to itself, presenting the appearance of providing the convenience of free parking \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n397 \nand doorman services to its patrons. In any case, whatever private arrangements existed between the \nrestaurant and Douglas were never disclosed to the customers. \n \nEven if such person did perform these services for several restaurants, it does not automatically follow \nthat he is a freelance entrepreneur, since a shared employee working for other small or moderately sized \nrestaurants in the area would seem a reasonable arrangement, in no way negating the authority of the \nattendant to act as doorman and receive cars for any one of these places individually. \n \nThe case most analogous to the instant one is Klotz v. El Morocco [Citation, 1968], and plaintiff here \nrelies on it. That case similarly involved the theft of a car parked by a uniformed individual standing in \nfront of defendant’s restaurant who, although not employed by it, parked vehicles for its patrons with the \nrestaurant’s knowledge and consent. Defendant here attempts to distinguish this case principally upon the \nground that the parties in El Morocco stipulated that the ‘doorman’ was an agent or employee of the \ndefendant acting within the scope of his authority. However, the judge made an express finding to that \neffect: ‘* * * there was sufficient evidence in plaintiff’s case on which to find DiGiovanni, the man in the \nuniform, was acting within the scope of his authority as agent of defendant.” Defendant here also points to \nthe fact that in Klotz DiGiovanni placed patrons’ car keys on a rack inside El Morocco; however, this is \nonly one fact to be considered in finding a bailment and is, to me, more relevant to the issue of the degree \nof care exercised. \n \nWhen defendant’s agent failed to produce plaintiff’s automobile, a presumption of negligence arose which \nnow requires defendant to come forward with a sufficient explanation to rebut this presumption. \n[Citation] The matter should be set down for trial on the issues of due care and of damages. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n398 \n1.

The defendant also noted that in Klotz, the doorman placed patrons' car keys on a rack inside the restaurant, whereas in the current case, the doorman did not perform this action. Despite this distinction, the defendant acknowledged that this single fact is only one of many to consider in determining a bailment and is less relevant to the issue of the degree of care exercised.

Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Co. \n330 N.E.2d 603 (N.Y. 1975) \n \nWachtler, J. \n \nThis appeal involves a claim for workmen’s compensation benefits for the period during which the \nclaimant was incapacitated by severe depression caused by the discovery of her immediate supervisor’s \nbody after he had committed suicide. \n \nThe facts as adduced at a hearing before the Workmen’s Compensation Board are uncontroverted. The \nclaimant, Mrs. Diana Wolfe, began her employment with the respondent department store, Sibley, \nLindsay & Curr Co. in February, 1968. After working for some time as an investigator in the security \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n408 \ndepartment of the store she became secretary to Mr. John Gorman, the security director. It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays. Mrs. Wolfe testified that throughout the several years she worked at Sibley’s Mr. \nGorman reacted to this holiday pressure by becoming extremely agitated and nervous. She noted, \nhowever, that this anxiety usually disappeared when the holiday season was over. Unfortunately, Mr. \nGorman’s nervous condition failed to abate after the 1970 holidays.… \nDespite the fact that he followed Mrs. Wolfe’s advice to see a doctor, Mr. Gorman’s mental condition \ncontinued to deteriorate. On one occasion he left work at her suggestion because he appeared to be so \nnervous. This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom. She entered his office to find him lying in a pool of blood caused by a self-inflicted gunshot \nwound in the head. Mrs. Wolfe became extremely upset and was unable to continue working that day. \n \nShe returned to work for one week only to lock herself in her office to avoid the questions of her fellow \nworkers. Her private physician perceiving that she was beset by feelings of guilt referred her to a \npsychiatrist and recommended that she leave work, which she did. While at home she ruminated about \nher guilt in failing to prevent the suicide and remained in bed for long periods of time staring at the \nceiling. The result was that she became unresponsive to her husband and suffered a weight loss of 20 \npounds. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Grinols diagnosed her condition as an acute depressive reaction. \n \nAfter attempting to treat her in his office Dr. Grinols realized that the severity of her depression mandated \nhospitalization. Accordingly, the claimant was admitted to the hospital on July 9, 1971 where she \nremained for two months during which time she received psychotherapy and medication. After she was \ndischarged, Dr. Grinols concluded that there had been no substantial remission in her depression and \nruminative guilt and so had her readmitted for electroshock treatment. These treatments lasted for three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n409 \nweeks and were instrumental in her recovery. She was again discharged and, in mid-January, 1972, \nresumed her employment with Sibley, Lindsay & Curr. \nMrs. Wolfe’s claim for workmen’s compensation was granted by the referee and affirmed by the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Board. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed citing its opinions in \n[Citations], [concluding]…that mental injury precipitated solely by psychic trauma is not compensable as \na matter of law. We do not agree with this conclusion. \n \nWorkmen’s compensation, as distinguished from tort liability which is essentially based on fault, is \ndesigned to shift the risk of loss of earning capacity caused by industrial accidents from the worker to \nindustry and ultimately the consumer. In light of its beneficial and remedial character the Workmen’s \nCompensation Law should be construed liberally in favor of the employee [Citation]. \n \nLiability under the act is predicated on accidental injury arising out of and in the course of \nemployment.…Applying these concepts to the case at bar we note that there is no issue raised concerning \nthe causal relationship between the occurrence and the injury. The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the",

This would require proving that the interfering party acted improperly without justification, and that such action directly caused the claimant's damages. In the context of Wolfe v.

The fiduciary duties typically include a duty of loyalty, care, and confidentiality. In this case, Mr. Gorman's role as security director created a potential fiduciary relationship with Mrs. Wolfe as his subordinate. However, the evidence did not show that Mr. Gorman breached these duties, as there was no indication that he acted dishonestly, negligently, or disclosed confidential information. Additionally, the court's decision cited previous cases indicating that mental injuries precipitated solely by psychic trauma are generally not compensable, thus limiting the possibility of proving a breach of fiduciary duty leading to compensable damages."

Under the principle of personal liability, the agent, who acted as a guarantor for the contract, is personally responsible for the obligations under the contract. Since the agent personally guaranteed the performance of the contract and the cars delivered were defective, the judgment would likely be enforced against the agent's personal assets. The US company would not be legally obligated to cover this debt unless there was a specific agreement stipulating that the company would indemnify the agent in such situations, which is not a common provision in typical agency agreements. Therefore, unless there is a contractual obligation to indemnify the agent, the US company is not liable for the judgment obtained by Bolivia."

            "chunk": "the principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors. The plumber who rushes to a client’s house to repair a leak and causes a traffic accident does \nnot subject the homeowner to liability. But there are exceptions to the rule. Generally, these exceptions \nfall into a category of duties that the law deems nondelegable. In some situations, one person is obligated \nto provide protection to or care for another. The failure to do so results in liability whether or not the \nharm befell the other because of an independent contractor’s wrongdoing. Thus a homeowner has a duty \nto ensure that physical conditions in and around the home are not unreasonably dangerous. If the owner \nhires an independent contracting firm to dig a sewer line and the contractor negligently fails to guard \npassersby against the danger of falling into an open trench, the homeowner is liable because the duty of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n426 \ncare in this instance cannot be delegated. (The contractor is, of course, liable to the homeowner for any \ndamages paid to an injured passerby.) \n \nLiability for Agent’s Intentional Torts \nIn the nineteenth century, a principal was rarely held liable for intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the \nprincipal did not command the act complained of. The thought was that one could never infer authority to \ncommit a willfully wrongful act. Today, liability for intentional torts is imputed to the principal if the \nagent is acting to further the principal’s business. See the very disturbing Lyon v. Carey in Section 10.4.2 \n\"Employer’s Liability for Employee’s Intentional Torts: Scope of Employment\". \nDeviations from Employment \nThe general rule is that a principal is liable for torts only if the servant committed them “in the scope of \nemployment.” But determining what this means is not easy. \n \nThe “Scope of Employment” Problem \nIt may be clear that the person causing an injury is the agent of another. But a principal cannot be \nresponsible for every act of an agent. If an employee is following the letter of his instructions, it will be \neasy to determine liability. But suppose an agent deviates in some way from his job. The classic test of \nliability was set forth in an 1833 English case, Joel v. Morrison. [1] The plaintiff was run over on a highway \nby a speeding cart and horse. The driver was the employee of another, and inside was a fellow employee. \nThere was no question that the driver had acted carelessly, but what he and his fellow employee were \ndoing on the road where the plaintiff was injured was disputed. For weeks before and after the accident, \nthe cart had never been driven in the vicinity in which the plaintiff was walking, nor did it have any \nbusiness there. The suggestion was that the employees might have gone out of their way for their own \npurposes. As the great English jurist Baron Parke put it, “If the servants, being on their master’s business, \ntook a detour to call upon a friend, the master will be responsible.…But if he was going on a frolic of his \nown, without being at all on his master’s business, the master will not be liable.” In applying this test, the \ncourt held the employer liable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n427 \nThe test is thus one of degree, and it is not always easy to decide when a detour has become so great as to \nbe transformed into a frolic. For a time, a rather mechanical rule was invoked to aid in making the \ndecision. The courts looked to the servant’s purposes in “detouring.” If the servant’s mind was fixed on \naccomplishing his own purposes, then the detour was held to be outside the scope of employment; hence \nthe tort was not imputed to the master. But if the servant also intended to accomplish his master’s \npurposes during his departure from the letter of his assignment, or if he committed the wrong while \nreturning to his master’s task after the completion of his frolic, then the tort was held to be within the \nscope of employment. \nThis test is not always easy to apply.

This is a significant shift from the nineteenth-century legal stance where a principal was rarely held liable for intentional wrongdoing by the agent if the principal did not command the act. An example of this principle is illustrated in the Lyon v. Carey case, which demonstrates that a principal can be held liable for an agent's intentional torts if it can be shown that the agent was acting in furtherance of the principal's business interests. However, the scope of employment must still be established, as the principal is only liable for torts committed by the agent while performing tasks within the scope of employment."

The classic test for this, as established in the Joel v. Morrison case, involves assessing whether the agent's actions were primarily for their own purposes (a frolic) or for the principal's business (within the scope of employment). The test is nuanced, as it requires evaluating the agent's intentions and the extent of the deviation from their assigned tasks. While a mechanical rule was once used to help determine this, modern applications often require a more flexible approach that considers the specific context and circumstances of each case."

Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency. Moreover, the principal may revoke the agency or \nthe agent may renounce it; such a revocation or renunciation of agency would be an express \ntermination. Even a contract that states the agreement is irrevocable will not be binding, although it can \nbe the basis for a damage suit against the one who breached the agreement by revoking or renouncing it. \nAs with any contract, a person has the power to breach, even in absence of the right to do so. If the agency \nis coupled with an interest, however, so that the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the \nagent has in the subject matter of the agency, then the principal lacks the power to revoke the agreement. \n \nImplied Termination \nThere are a number of other circumstances that will spell the end of the relationship by implication. \nUnspecified events or changes in business conditions or the value of the subject matter of the agency \nmight lead to a reasonable inference that the agency should be terminated or suspended; for example, the \nprincipal desires the agent to buy silver but the silver market unexpectedly rises and silver doubles in \nprice overnight. Other circumstances that end the agency include disloyalty of the agent (e.g., he accepts \nan appointment that is adverse to his first principal or embezzles from the principal), bankruptcy of the \nagent or of the principal, the outbreak of war (if it is reasonable to infer that the principal, knowing of the \nwar, would not want the agent to continue to exercise authority), and a change in the law that makes a \ncontinued carrying out of the task illegal or seriously interferes with it. \n \n \nBy Operation of Law \nAside from the express termination (by agreement of both or upon the insistence of one), or the necessary \nor reasonable inferences that can be drawn from their agreements, the law voids agencies under certain \ncircumstances. The most frequent termination by operation of law is the death of a principal or an agent. \nThe death of an agent also terminates the authority of subagents he has appointed, unless the principal \nhas expressly consented to the continuing validity of their appointment. Similarly, if the agent or principal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n436 \nloses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, it is suspended or terminated. The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability. Apparent authority in many instances will still exist; this is \ncalled lingering authority. It is imperative for a principal on termination of authority to notify all those \nwho may still be in a position to deal with the agent. The only exceptions to this requirement are when \ntermination is effected by death, loss of the principal’s capacity, or an event that would make it impossible \nto carry out the object of the agency. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the \nscope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks \nauthority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. \nAgencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue.

For instance, an agency might terminate 'on the sale of the house' or 'at the conclusion of the last horse race'. Mutual consent between the parties can also bring an end to the agency. Additionally, the principal may revoke the agency, or the agent may renounce it, both considered express terminations. Even a contract stating the agreement is irrevocable can still be the basis for a damage suit if the agreement is breached.

Similarly, if the agent or principal loses the capacity to enter into an agency relationship due to incapacity, the agency is suspended or terminated. Another scenario leading to termination by operation of law is when the purpose of the agency becomes illegal.

Whether Brown had apparent authority to make the July 16, 1976, modification is \na question of how, in the circumstances, a third person, e.g., a customer of the Bank such as Kanavos, \nwould reasonably interpret Brown’s authority in light of the manifestations of his principal, the Bank. \n \nTitles of office generally do not establish apparent authority. Brown’s status as executive vice-president \nwas not, therefore, a badge of apparent authority to modify agreements to which the Bank was a party. \n \nTrappings of office, e.g., office and furnishing, private secretary, while they may have some tendency to \nsuggest executive responsibility, do not without other evidence provide a basis for finding apparent \nauthority. Apparent authority is drawn from a variety of circumstances. Thus in Federal Nat. Bank v. \nO’Connell…(1940), it was held apparent authority could be found because an officer who was a director, \nvice-president and treasurer took an active part in directing the affairs of the bank in question and was \nseen by third parties talking with customers and negotiating with them. In Costonis v. Medford Housing \nAuthy.…(1961), the executive director of a public housing authority was held to have apparent authority to \nvary specifications on the basis of the cumulative effect of what he had done and what the authority \nappeared to permit him to do. \n \nIn the instant case there was evidence of the following variety of circumstances: Brown’s title of executive \nvice-president; the location of his office opposite the president; his frequent communications with the \npresident; the long course of dealing and negotiations; the encouragement of Kanavos by the president to \ndeal with Brown; the earlier amendment of the agreement by Brown on behalf of the Bank on material \npoints, namely the price to be paid by the Bank for the shares and the repurchase price; the size of the \nBank (fourteen or fifteen branches in addition to the main office); the secondary, rather than \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n440 \nfundamental, nature of the change in the terms of the agreement now repudiated by the Bank, measured \nagainst the context of the overall transaction; and Brown’s broad operating authority…all these added \ntogether would support a finding of apparent authority. When a corporate officer, as here, is allowed to \nexercise general executive responsibilities, the “public expectation is that the corporation should be bound \nto engagements made on its behalf by those who presume to have, and convincingly appear to have, the \npower to agree.” [Citation] This principle does not apply, of course, where in the business context, the \nrequirement of specific authority is presumed, e.g., the sale of a major asset by a corporation or a \ntransaction which by its nature commits the corporation to an obligation outside the scope of its usual \nactivity. The modification agreement signed by Brown and dated July 16, 1976, should have been admitted \nin evidence, and a verdict should not have been directed. \n \nJudgment reversed. \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Brown's status as executive vice-president was not, therefore, a badge of apparent authority to modify agreements to which the Bank was a party.

                    "answer": "Apparent authority is related to estoppel in that if a principal (such as the Bank) has led a third party (like Kanavos) to believe that an agent (like Brown) has the authority to make certain modifications to an agreement, then the principal can be estopped from denying that authority. Essentially, the Bank is estopped from denying Brown's authority to make the July 16, 1976, modification because it had previously allowed Brown to negotiate and amend the agreement on its behalf. This principle arises from the public expectation that a corporation should be bound by engagements made on its behalf by individuals who appeared to have the power to agree."

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership. There are also limited partnerships \nand limited liability partnerships, which are discussed in Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". \n \nTable 11.1 Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and Limited Liability \nCompanies \n \n2003 \n2004 \n2005 \n2006",

The concept of 'respondeat superior' is a legal doctrine that holds the principal responsible for the tortious acts committed by their agents while performing tasks within the scope of their employment. This principle is based on the idea that the principal benefits from the agent's work and therefore should bear the consequences of the agent's wrongful actions. However, if the agent acts outside the scope of their authority or commits a personal act unrelated to the principal's business, the principal may not be held liable."

                    "question": "What are the key differences between a general partnership and a limited partnership, and how do these differences affect the liability of the partners involved?",
                    "answer": "A general partnership consists of two or more partners who share equal ownership, management, and unlimited personal liability for the partnership's debts and obligations. In contrast, a limited partnership has both general partners, who manage the business and have unlimited liability, and limited partners, who do not participate in management and whose liability is limited to the amount of their investment. The key difference lies in the level of involvement and financial responsibility of each partner. In a general partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable, meaning any partner can be held responsible for the entire debt of the partnership. In a limited partnership, only the general partners are liable for the partnership's debts and obligations, providing protection to the limited partners from personal financial loss related to the partnership's operations."

Understand partnership by estoppel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n464 \n \nCreation of an Express Partnership \nCreation in General \nThe most common way of forming a partnership is expressly—that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a \npartnership is called an express partnership. If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership. Able contributes \n$250,000. Baker contributes the building and space in which the business will operate. Carr contributes \nhis services; he will manage the dealership. \n \nThe first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have a partnership agreement. As should be clear \nfrom the foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the tests of partnership are met. \nHowever, they ought to have an agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among themselves. \n \nThe agreement itself is a contract and should follow the principles and rules spelled out in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" of this book. Because it is intended to govern the relations of the partners toward themselves \nand their business, every partnership contract should set forth clearly the following terms: (1) the name \nunder which the partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3) the nature, scope, and \nlocation of the business; (4) the capital contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to be \ndivided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7) the responsibilities of each partner for \nmanaging the business; (8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm; (9) the method by \nwhich a given partner may withdraw from the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event of a \npartner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs; and (11) method of \ndissolution. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n465 \nSpecific Issues of Concern \nIn forming a partnership, three of these items merit special attention. And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.)

Firstly, a partnership can include entities like corporations or even other partnerships, and family members can also be partners, though a minor partner may disaffirm the agreement. Secondly, if the business cannot be completed within one year, the agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds, although most partnerships are at-will and thus not covered by this statute. Lastly, the chosen name for the partnership must accurately reflect its legal status and should not be misleading or deceptive, as it could lead to legal issues if not registered or if it violates assumed or fictitious name statutes in the state where the business operates."

Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent, \ncoupled with the absence of profit sharing, they become strong factors in discrediting the partnership \nargument. Such weighing of the elements against a partnership finding compares favorably with Fenwick \nv. Unemployment Compensation Commission, which decided against the partnership theory on similar \nfacts, including the filing of partnership income tax forms. \n \nIn addition, the total circumstances of the case taken together indicate the employer-employee \nrelationship between Chaiken and his barbers.

The barbers brought into the relationship only the \nequipment required of all barber shop operators. And each barber had his own individual “partnership” \nwith Chaiken.

Finally, the name “Richard’s Barber \nShop” continued to be used after the execution of the so-called partnership agreements. [The \nCommission’s decision is affirmed.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why did the unemployment board sue Chaiken? \n2. Why did Chaiken set up this “partnership”? \n3. What factors did the court examine to determine whether there was a partnership here? Which one was \nthe most important? \n4. Why would it be unusual in a partnership agreement to set forth the hours of work and days off? \n \n \nCreation of a Partnership: Registering the Name \nLoomis v. Whitehead \n183 P.3d 890 (Nev. 2008) \nPer Curiam. \n \nIn this appeal, we address whether [Nevada Revised Statute] NRS 602.070 bars the partners of an \nunregistered fictitious name partnership from bringing an action arising out of a business agreement that \nwas not made under the fictitious name. [The statute] prohibits persons who fail to file an assumed or \nfictitious name certificate from suing on any contract or agreement made under the assumed or fictitious \nname. We conclude that it does not bar the partners from bringing the action so long as the partners did \nnot conduct the business or enter into an agreement under the fictitious name or otherwise mislead the \nother party into thinking that he was doing business with some entity other than the partners themselves. \n \nBackground Facts \nAppellants Leroy Loomis and David R. Shanahan raised and sold cattle in Elko County, Nevada. Each of \nthe appellants had certain responsibilities relating to the cattle business.

Shanahan and Loomis subsequently alleged that their cattle were \nmalnourished and that a number of their cattle died from starvation that winter at Whitehead’s ranch. \nWhitehead denied these allegations. \n \nSuit against Whitehead \nThe following summer, Shanahan and Loomis sued Whitehead, claiming negligence and breach of \ncontract. Later, well into discovery, Whitehead was made aware of the existence of the 52 Cattle Company \nwhen Shanahan stated in his deposition that he did not actually own any of the cattle on Whitehead’s \nranch. In his deposition, he described the partnership arrangement. At about the same time, Whitehead \nlearned that the name “52 Cattle Company” was not registered with the Elko County Clerk.",

The court considered several factors to determine the nature of Chaiken's relationship with his barbers, including the absence of profit sharing, the lack of decision-making rights, the absence of liability sharing, and the fact that Chaiken conducted all business transactions in his own name.

The key findings were that although the partners had no formal partnership agreement and did not file an assumed or fictitious name certificate, they did not conduct their business under the fictitious name '52 Cattle Company' and did not mislead Whitehead into believing he was dealing with an entity other than the partners themselves. Therefore, the court concluded that the partners were not barred from bringing the action against Whitehead."

Later the Volkmans got a letter from McNamee on \nstationery that read “DP Associates,” which they assumed was derived from the first names of David and \nPhillip. At the DP Associates office McNamee introduced Mr. Volkman to Carroll, who said to Volkman, “I \nhope we’ll be working together.” At one point during the signing process a question arose and McNamee \nsaid, “I will ask Phil.” He returned with the answer to the question. After the contract was signed but before \nconstruction began, Mr. Volkman visited the DP Associates office where the two men chatted; Carroll said \nto him, “I am happy that we will be working with you.” The Volkmans never saw Carroll on the construction \nsite and knew of no other construction supervised by Carroll.

                    "answer": "Under partnership law principles, Carroll could potentially be held liable for the construction issues. Since the Volkmans believed they were entering into a contract with Carroll through DP Associates and McNamee, Carroll's actions and representations could be considered binding on the partnership. This belief, coupled with Carroll's direct involvement in the project and his assurance to Mr. Volkman that 'David will take care of it,' suggests that Carroll acted within the scope of his authority as a partner. Thus, if the construction issues arise due to Carroll's actions or omissions, the Volkmans might have grounds to hold Carroll personally liable under the doctrine of apparent authority or actual partnership existence. However, the court would need to consider whether Carroll and McNamee had a partnership relationship, and if Carroll's actions were within the scope of that partnership. If the court finds that Carroll and McNamee were indeed partners and Carroll acted within the scope of his authority, then Carroll could be held liable for the construction issues."

                    "answer": "According to partnership law principles, a minor cannot form a partnership with an adult. The reason lies in the nature of a partnership, which requires full legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. Minors lack the legal capacity to enter into such agreements without the consent of a legal guardian. Therefore, a partnership involving a minor would be invalid due to the minor's lack of legal competence. This is further supported by the fact that most jurisdictions have specific age requirements for engaging in certain business activities, and partnerships fall under these regulations. Additionally, the concept of partnership law often emphasizes the importance of mutual agreement and shared responsibility, which minors, being under the age of majority, are typically not capable of providing due to their limited understanding of contractual obligations and potential liabilities."

Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”? Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404. [8] \n \nThe Rights That Partners Have in a Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n496 \nNecessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of",

Who is entitled to her share of the specific property, such as inventory, the \nbuilding, and the money in the cash register—her husband and children, or the other partners, Baker and \nCarr? Section 25(1) of UPA declares that the partners hold the partnership property \nas tenants in partnership. As spelled out in Section 25(2), the specific property interest of a tenant in \npartnership vests in the surviving partners, not in the heirs. But the heirs are entitled to the deceased \npartner’s interest in the partnership itself, so that while Baker and Carr may use the partnership property \nfor the benefit of the partnership without consulting Able’s heirs, they must account to her heirs for her \nproper share of the partnership’s profits. \n \n \n \nRights in Specific Property: RUPA Approach \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n499 \nSection 501 of RUPA provides, “A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in \npartnership property which can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.” Partnership property \nis owned by the entity; UPA’s concept of tenants in partnership is abolished in favor of adoption of the \nentity theory. The result, however, is not different. \n \nRight to Assign Partnership Interest \nOne of the hallmarks of the capitalistic system is that people should be able to dispose of their property \ninterests more or less as they see fit. Partnership interests may be assigned to some extent. \n \nVoluntary Assignment \nAt common law, assignment of a partner’s interest in the business—for example, as a mortgage in return \nfor a loan—would result in a legal dissolution of the partnership. Thus in the absence of UPA, which \nchanged the law, Baker’s decision to mortgage his interest in the car dealership in return for a $20,000 \nloan from his bank would mean that the three—Able, Baker, and Carr—were no longer partners. Section \n27 of UPA declares that assignment of an interest in the partnership neither dissolves the partnership nor \nentitles the assignee “to interfere in the management or administration of the partnership business or \naffairs, or to require any information or account of partnership transactions, or to inspect the partnership \nbooks.” The assignment merely entitles the assignee to receive whatever profits the assignor would have \nreceived—this is the assignor’s transferable interest. [15] Under UPA, this interest is assignable. [16] \n \nUnder RUPA, the same distinction is made between a partner’s interest in the partnership and a partner’s \ntransferable interest. The Official Comment to Section 101 reads as follows: “‘Partnership interest’ or \n‘partner’s interest in the partnership’ is defined to mean all of a partner’s interests in the partnership, \nincluding the partner’s transferable interest and all management and other rights. A partner’s \n‘transferable interest’ is a more limited concept and means only his share of the profits and losses and \nright to receive distributions, that is, the partner’s economic interests.” [17] \n \nThis transferable interest is assignable under RUPA 503 (unless the partners agree to restrict transfers, \nSection 103(a)). It does not, by itself, cause the dissolution of the partnership; it does not entitle the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n500 \ntransferee to access to firm information, to participate in running the firm, or to inspect or copy the \nbooks. The transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled \nto, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there \nbeen no assignment. \n \nRUPA Section 101(b)(3) confers standing on a transferee to seek a judicial dissolution and winding up of \nthe partnership business as provided in Section 801(6), thus continuing the rule of UPA Section 32(2). \nBut under RUPA 601(4)(ii), the other partners may by unanimous vote expel a partner who has made “a \ntransfer of all or substantially all of that partner’s transferable interest in the partnership, other than a \ntransfer for security purposes [as for a loan].” Upon a creditor foreclosure of the security interest, though, \nthe partner may be expelled. \n \nInvoluntary Assignment \nIt may be a misnomer to describe an involuntary assignment as a “right”; it might better be thought of as a \nconsequence of the right to own property. In any event, if a partner is sued in his personal capacity and a \njudgment is rendered against him, the question arises: may the judgment creditor seize partnership \nproperty?

Instead, the transferee is entitled to whatever distributions the transferor partner would have been entitled to, including, upon dissolution of the firm, the net amounts the transferor would have received had there been no assignment.

                    "answer": "RUPA modified the 'accounting' right in several ways compared to the UPA. Under UPA, the right to an accounting was limited primarily to situations where one of the partners had grounds to complain, whereas RUPA broadens this right, allowing partners to maintain a variety of legal or equitable actions, including an action for an accounting, even during the term of the partnership. Additionally, RUPA reflects the entity theory, permitting the partnership itself to sue a partner for wrongdoing, which is not permitted under UPA. Furthermore, RUPA provides that an accounting is not a prerequisite to the availability of other remedies a partner may have against the partnership or other partners, reflecting a new policy choice that partners should have access to the courts during the term of the partnership to resolve claims against the partnership and the other partners, with broad judicial discretion to fashion appropriate remedies."

                    "answer": "The fiduciary duty, as defined under both UPA and RUPA, imposes a requirement on partners to act in the best interests of the partnership rather than their personal interests. However, RUPA provides more clarity and detail regarding the nature of this duty. According to RUPA, the partnership interest of each partner is subject to the claims of the partnership's creditors to the extent of the partner's interest, and the partnership is liable for the debts and obligations of the partners to the extent provided in the partnership agreement. This means that RUPA reinforces the principle that partners owe a fiduciary duty to the partnership and its creditors, ensuring that the partnership's interests take precedence over individual partners' interests. In contrast, UPA does not explicitly mention the concept of a fiduciary duty, and the extent of such a duty may vary based on state law interpretations. Therefore, RUPA clarifies the scope and application of the fiduciary duty, making it more explicit and consistent across jurisdictions."

RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners. Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action. Each and every partner is separately liable for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n509 \nentire amount of the debt, although the plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the total of his \ndamages. The practical effect of the rules making partners personally liable for partnership contracts and \ntorts can be huge. In his classic textbook Economics, Professor Paul Samuelson observed that unlimited \nliability “reveals why partnerships tend to be confined to small, personal enterprises.…When it becomes a \nquestion of placing their personal fortunes in jeopardy, people are reluctant to put their capital into \ncomplex ventures over which they can exercise little control.…In the field of investment banking, concerns \nlike JPMorgan Chase used to advertise proudly ‘not incorporated’ so that their creditors could have extra \nassurance. But even these concerns have converted themselves into corporate entities.” [8] \n \nPartners’ Personal Liability for Torts \nOf course, a person is always liable for his own torts. All partners are also liable for any partner’s tort \ncommitted in the scope of partnership business under agency law, and this liability is—again—personal \nand unlimited, subject to RUPA’s requirement that the judgment creditor exhaust the partnership’s assets \nbefore going after the separate assets of the partners. The partner who commits a tort or breach of trust \nmust indemnify the partnership for losses paid to the third party. [9] \nLiability for Crimes \nCriminal liability is generally personal to the miscreant. Nonparticipating copartners are ordinarily not \nliable for crimes if guilty intent is an element. When guilty intent is not an element, as in certain \nregulatory offenses, all partners may be guilty of an act committed by a partner in the course of the \nbusiness. \n \nLiability for Taxes \nCorporate income gets taxed twice under federal law: once to the corporation and again to the \nshareholders who receive income as dividends. However, the partnership’s income “passes through” the \npartnership and is distributed to the partners under the conduit theory. When partners get income \nfrom the firm they have to pay tax on it, but the partnership pays no tax (it files an information return). \nThis is perceived to be a significant advantage of the partnership form. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n510 \n \nThe partnership is generally liable for any contract made by a partner with authority express, implied, or \napparent. Under RUPA the firm, partners, or even nonpartners may to some extent limit their liability by filing \n“statements” with the appropriate state registrar; such statements only affect those who know of them, \nexcept that a notice affecting the right of a partner to sell real estate or regarding dissociation or dissolution is \neffective against the world after ninety days. \nAll partners are liable for contracts entered into and torts committed by any partner acting in or apparently in \nthe normal course of business. This liability is personal and unlimited, joint and several (although under UPA \ncontract liability it is only joint). Incoming partners are not liable, in contract or in tort, for activities predating \ntheir arrival, but their capital contribution is at risk. Criminal liability is generally personal unless the crime \nrequires no intention. \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What is the partnership’s liability for contracts entered into by its partners? \n2.

                    "answer": "People might feel more comfortable knowing that JPMorgan Bank was a partnership because of the concept of limited liability associated with corporations. In the case of a corporation, shareholders' personal assets are typically protected from the company's debts and liabilities, which means that even if the bank were to fail, the personal wealth of the shareholders, including individuals like J.P. Morgan, would generally remain safe. By contrast, in a partnership, partners are personally liable for the partnership's debts and obligations. Therefore, if JPMorgan was a partnership, it would mean that the personal fortunes of partners, including J.P. Morgan, would be at risk if the partnership faced financial difficulties. This higher level of personal risk could deter individuals from investing significant personal capital in complex ventures where they have little control, especially when the potential financial exposure is substantial."

In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions \nbegun but not finished at the time of dissolution. [5] Notwithstanding the latter exception, no partner can \nbind the partnership if it has dissolved because it has become unlawful to carry on the business or if the \npartner seeking to exercise authority has become bankrupt. \n \nAfter Dissolution \nAfter a partnership has dissolved, it can follow one of two paths. It can carry on business as a new \npartnership, or it can wind up the business and cease operating (see Figure 12.2 \"Alternatives Following \nUPA Dissolution\"). \n \nFigure 12.2 Alternatives Following UPA Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n514 \n \nForming a New Partnership \nIn order to carry on the business as a new partnership, there must be an agreement—preferably as part of \nthe original partnership agreement but maybe only after dissolution (and maybe oral)—that upon \ndissolution (e.g., if a partner dies, retires, or quits) the others will regroup and carry on. \n \nUnder UPA the remaining partners have the right to carry on when (1) the dissolution was in \ncontravention of the agreement, (2) a partner was expelled according to the partnership agreement, or (3) \nall partners agree to carry on. [6] \n \nWhether the former partner dies or otherwise quits the firm, the noncontinuing one or his, her, or its legal \nrepresentative is entitled to an accounting and to be paid the value of the partnership interest, less \ndamages for wrongful dissolution. [7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference. If the policy pays out less, \nthe partnership agrees to pay the difference in installments. \n \nAnother set of issues arises when the partnership changes because an old partner departs and a new one \njoins. Suppose that Baker leaves the car dealership business and his interest is purchased by Alice, who is \nthen admitted to the partnership. Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000. After Baker left and Alice joined, Mogul sells another $5,000 \nworth of parts to the firm on credit, and Sizzling Radiator Repair, a new creditor, advances $3,000 worth \nof radiator repair parts. These circumstances pose four questions. \n \nFirst, do creditors of the old partnership remain creditors of the new partnership? Yes. [8] \n \nSecond, does Baker, the old partner, remain liable to the creditors of the old partnership? Yes. [9] That \ncould pose uncomfortable problems for Baker, who may have left the business because he lost interest in \nit and wished to put his money elsewhere. The last thing he wants is the threat of liability hanging over his \nhead when he can no longer profit from the firm’s operations. That is all the more true if he had a falling \nout with his partners and does not trust them. The solution is given in UPA Section 36(2), which says that \nan old partner is discharged from liability if the creditors and the new partnership agree to discharge him. \n \nThird, is Alice, the new partner, liable to creditors of the old partnership? Yes, but only to the extent of her \ncapital contribution. [10] \n \nFourth, is Baker, the old partner, liable for debts incurred after his withdrawal from the partnership? \nSurprisingly, yes, unless Baker takes certain action toward old and new creditors. He must provide actual \nnotice that he has withdrawn to anyone who has extended credit in the past. Once he has done so, he has \nno liability to these creditors for credit extended to the partnership thereafter. Of course, it would be \ndifficult to provide notice to future creditors, since at the time of withdrawal they would not have had a",

When a partner dies or quits, the non-continuing partner or their legal representative is entitled to an accounting and payment of the partnership interest, less damages for wrongful dissolution. The partnership may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or their estate, or use proceeds from a life insurance policy to make the payment. If the partnership changes because an old partner departs and a new one joins, the old partner remains liable to the creditors of the old partnership, while the new partner is liable only to the extent of their capital contribution.

[25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and \nfinally (4) to partners for their share of profits (see Figure 12.3 \"Priority Partnership Liabilities under \nRUPA\"). However, RUPA eliminates the distinction between capital and profits when the firm pays \npartners what is owed to them; RUPA Section 807(b) speaks simply of the right of a partner to a \nliquidating distribution. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.3 Priority Partnership Liabilities under RUPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n522 \n \n \nPartners are entitled to share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including \nthose owed to partners, are paid off, although the partnership agreement can state a different share—for \nexample, in proportion to capital contribution. If after winding up there is a net loss, whether capital or \notherwise, each partner must contribute toward it in accordance with his share in the profits, had there \nbeen any, unless the agreement states otherwise. If any of the partners is insolvent or refuses to contribute \nand cannot be sued, the others must contribute their own share to pay off the liabilities and in addition \nmust contribute, in proportion to their share of the profits, the additional amount necessary to pay the \nliabilities of their defaulting partners. \n \nIn the event of insolvency, a court may take possession of both partnership property and individual assets \nof the partners; this again is a big disadvantage to the partnership form. \n \nThe estate of a deceased partner is credited or liable as that partner would have been if she were living at \nthe time of the distribution. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder UPA, the withdrawal of any partner from the partnership causes dissolution; the withdrawal may be \ncaused in accordance with the agreement, in violation of the agreement, by operation of law, or by court \norder. Dissolution terminates the partners’ authority to act for the partnership, except for winding up, but \nremaining partners may decide to carry on as a new partnership or may decide to terminate the firm. If they \ncontinue, the old creditors remain as creditors of the new firm, the former partner remains liable for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n523 \nobligations incurred while she was a partner (she may be liable for debts arising after she left, unless proper \nnotice is given to creditors), and the former partner or her estate is entitled to an accounting and payment for \nthe partnership interest. If the partners move to terminate the firm, winding up begins. \nUnder RUPA, a partner who ceases to be involved in the business is dissociated, but dissociation does not \nnecessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation happens when a partner quits, voluntarily or involuntarily; when a \npartner dies or becomes incompetent; or on request by the firm or a partner upon court order for a partner’s \nwrongful conduct, among other reasons. The dissociated partner loses actual authority to bind the firm but \nremains liable for predissociation obligations and may have lingering authority or lingering liability for two \nyears provided the other party thought the dissociated one was still a partner; a notice of dissociation will, \nafter ninety days, be good against the world as to dissociation and dissolution. If the firm proceeds to \ntermination (though partners can stop the process before its end), the next step is dissolution, which occurs \nby acts of partners, by operation of law, or by court order upon application by a partner if continuing the \nbusiness has become untenable. After dissolution, the only business undertaken is to wind up affairs. \nHowever, the firm may continue after dissociation; it must buy out the dissociated one’s interest, minus \ndamages if the dissociation was wrongful. \nIf the firm is to be terminated, winding up entails finishing the business at hand, paying off creditors, and \nsplitting the remaining surplus or liabilities according the parties’ agreement or, absent any, according to the \nrelevant act (UPA or RUPA). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

If the act is not apparently for carrying on the partnership business, an act of a partner binds the partnership only if authorized by the other partners. This means that unless explicitly authorized by the other partners, a partner must ensure that their actions align with the partnership's business operations to effectively bind the partnership."

            "chunk": "Definition \nA limited partnership (LP) is defined as “a partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws \nof a State and having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.” [2] The form tends \nto be attractive in business situations that focus on a single or limited-term project, such as making a \nmovie or developing real estate; it is also widely used by private equity firms. \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nUnlike a general partnership, a limited partnership is created in accordance with the state statute \nauthorizing it. There are two categories of partners: limited and general. The limited partners capitalize \nthe business and the general partners run it. \n \nCreation \nThe act requires that the firm’s promoters file a certificate of limited partnership with the secretary \nof state; if they do not, or if the certificate is substantially defective, a general partnership is created. The \ncertificate must be signed by all general partners. It must include the name of the limited partnership \n(which must include the words limited partnership so the world knows there are owners of the firm who \nare not liable beyond their contribution) and the names and business addresses of the general partners. If \nthere are any changes in the general partners, the certificate must be amended. The general partner may \nbe, and often is, a corporation. Having a general partner be a corporation achieves the goal of limited \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n550 \nliability for everyone, but it is somewhat of a “clunky” arrangement. That problem is obviated in the \nlimited liability company, discussed in Section 13.2 \"Limited Liability Companies\". Here is an example of \na limited partnership operating \nagreement:http://www.wyopa.com/Articles%20of%20limited%20partnership.htm. \n \nAny natural person, partnership, limited partnership (domestic or foreign), trust, estate, association, or \ncorporation may become a partner of a limited partnership. \n \nCapitalization \nThe money to capitalize the business typically comes mostly from the limited partners, who may \nthemselves be partnerships or corporations. That is, the limited partners use the business as an \ninvestment device: they hope the managers of the firm (the general partners) will take their contributions \nand give them a positive return on it. The contributions may be money, services, or property, or promises \nto make such contributions in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nControl is not generally shared by both classes of partners. \n \nGeneral Partners \nThe control of the limited partnership is in the hands of the general partners, which may—as noted—be \npartnerships or corporations. \n \nLimited Partners \nUnder ULPA-1985 and its predecessors, a limited partner who exercised any significant control would \nincur liability like a general partner as to third parties who believed she was one (the “control rule”). \nHowever, among the things a limited partner could do that would not risk the loss of insulation from \npersonal liability were these “safe harbors”: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n551 \n• \nActing as an agent, employee, or contractor for the firm; or being an officer, director, or \nshareholder of a corporate general partner \n• \nConsulting with the general partner of the firm \n• \nRequesting or attending a meeting of partners \n• \nBeing a surety for the firm \n• \nVoting on amendments to the agreement, on dissolution or winding up the partnership, on loans \nto the partnership, on a change in its nature of business, on removing or admitting a general or \nlimited partner \n \nHowever, see Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" for how this “control rule” has been \nabolished under ULPA-2001. \nGeneral partners owe fiduciary duties to other general partners, the firm, and the limited partners; limited \npartners who do not exercise control do not owe fiduciary duties. See Figure 13.1 \"The Limited \nPartnership under ULPA-1985\". \n \nFigure 13.1 The Limited Partnership under ULPA-1985 \n \n \nThe partnership agreement may specify which general or limited partners have the right to vote on any \nmatter, but if the agreement grants limited partners voting rights beyond the “safe harbor,” a court may \nabolish that partner’s limited liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n552 \nAssignment of Partnership Rights \nLimited partnership interests may be assigned in whole or in part; if in whole, the assignor ceases to be a \npartner unless otherwise agreed. An assignment is usually made as security for a loan. The assignee \nbecomes a new limited partner only if all the others consent or if provided for in the certificate; the \nassignment does not cause dissolution. The happy ease with which a limited partner can divest himself of \nthe partnership interest makes the investment in the firm here more like that in a corporation than in a \ngeneral partnership. \n \n \n \n \nInspection of Books \nLimited partners have the right to inspect the firm’s books and records, they may own competing",

                    "answer": "A limited partnership (LP) differs from a general partnership primarily in its creation process and structure. Unlike a general partnership, a limited partnership must be created in accordance with the state statute authorizing it. This means that the formation of a limited partnership requires the filing of a certificate of limited partnership with the secretary of state. In contrast, a general partnership can be formed simply by two or more individuals agreeing to join together as partners. Regarding capitalization, the limited partners in a limited partnership are responsible for providing most of the capital needed to start and operate the business, while the general partners manage the day-to-day operations. The capital contributions can be in the form of money, services, property, or promises to contribute in the future. General partners, on the other hand, are typically responsible for managing the business and making decisions regarding its operations."

Pass-through (“conduit”) taxation is usually \nvery important to partners. \nTermination \nThe limited partnership’s termination involves the same three steps as in a general partnership: (1) \ndissolution, (2) winding up, and (3) termination. \n \nDissolution \nDissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not \nnecessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court \norder, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events \nmay cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2) \ntermination upon an event specified in the partnership agreement; (3) the unanimous written consent of \nthe partners; (4) the withdrawal of a general partner, unless at least one remains and the agreement says \none is enough, or if within ninety days all partners agree to continue; (5) an event that causes the business \nto be illegal; and (6) judicial decree of dissolution when it is not reasonable to carry on. If the agreement \nhas no term, its dissolution is not triggered by some agreed-to event, and none of the other things listed \ncause dissolution. \n \nDissolution requires the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the state if winding up commences. \n \nWinding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n555 \nGeneral partners who have not wrongfully dissolved the partnership may wind it up, and so may the \nlimited partners if all the general partners have wrongfully dissolved the firm. Any partner or that \nperson’s legal representative can petition a court for winding up, with cause. \n \nUpon winding up, the assets are distributed (1) to creditors, including creditor-partners, not including \nliabilities for distributions of profit; (2) to partners and ex-partners to pay off unpaid distributions; (3) to \npartners as return of capital contributions, unless otherwise agreed; and (4) to partners for partnership \ninterests in proportion as they share in distributions, unless otherwise agreed. No distinction is made \nbetween general and limited partners—they share equally, unless otherwise agreed. When winding up is \ncompleted, the firm is terminated. \n \nIt is worth reiterating the part about “unless otherwise agreed”: people who form any kind of a business \norganization—partnership, a hybrid form, or corporations—can to a large extent choose to structure their \nrelationship as they see fit. Any aspect of the company’s formation, operation, or ending that is not \nincluded in an agreement flops into the default provisions of the relevant law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA limited partnership is a creature of statute: it requires filing a certificate with the state because it confers on \nsome of its members the marvel of limited liability. It is an investment device composed of one or more \ngeneral partners and one or more limited partners; limited partners may leave with six months’ notice and are \nentitled to an appropriate payout. The general partner is liable as a partner is a general partnership; the \nlimited partners’ liability is limited to the loss of their investment, unless they exercise so much control of the \nfirm as to become general partners. The general partner is paid, and the general and limited partners split \nprofit as per the agreement or, if none, in the proportion as they made capital contributions. The firm is \nusually taxed like a general partnership: it is a conduit for the partners’ income. The firm is dissolved upon the \nend of its term, upon an event specified in the agreement, or in several other circumstances, but it may have \nindefinite existence. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n556 \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Dissolution is the initial step towards termination, which may happen due to various events such as termination of the partnership according to the certificate's provisions, termination upon an event specified in the partnership agreement, the unanimous written consent of the partners, the withdrawal of a general partner provided at least one remains and the agreement allows for this, an event making the business illegal, or a judicial decree of dissolution if it is deemed unreasonable to continue. Dissolution requires the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the state if winding up begins. Winding up involves liquidating the assets of the partnership and distributing them to creditors, partners, ex-partners, and the limited and general partners in accordance with their agreements or default provisions of the relevant law.

                    "answer": "During the winding up process of a limited partnership, the assets are distributed in a specific order. First, the assets are allocated to creditors, including creditor-partners, but not including liabilities for distributions of profit. Next, the assets are used to pay off any unpaid distributions to partners and ex-partners. Following that, the remaining assets are returned to the partners in proportion to their capital contributions, unless otherwise agreed upon. Finally, any remaining assets are distributed to the partners in proportion to their share in the partnership profits, again unless otherwise agreed. This distribution order ensures that creditors are paid first, followed by partners and ex-partners, and finally, any leftover assets are shared among the partners. The order of distribution can vary based on the terms of the partnership agreement and applicable laws, emphasizing flexibility in partnership structures while providing a default mechanism through statutory provisions."

Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise \nagreed. Member-managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the parameters of those duties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n559 \nvary from state to state. If the firm is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the firm; \nthe managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty, but the nonmanager members usually do not. \nSome states’ statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests of the members. Most statutes \nprovide that any extraordinary firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the agreement, \nadmit new members, sell all the assets prior to dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can \nmake their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g., voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of \nmajor decisions) imposed under state corporate law. \n \nIf the firm has a centralized manager system, it gets a check in its “corporate-like” box, so it will need to \nmake sure there are enough noncorporate-like attributes to make up for this one. If it looks too much like \na corporation, it will be taxed like one. \n \nOne of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the corporation is that no annual meetings are \nrequired, and no minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations ignore these formalities to \ntheir peril, but with the LLC there are no worries about such record keeping. \n \nCompensation \nDistributions are allocated among members of an LLC according to the operating agreement; managing \npartners may be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions are allocated among members \nin proportion to the values of contributions made by them or required to be made by them. Upon a \nmember’s dissociation that does not cause dissolution, a dissociating member has the right to distribution \nas provided in the agreement, or—if no agreement—the right to receive the fair value of the member’s \ninterest within a reasonable time after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them would \ncause the LLC to become insolvent. \n \nLiability \nThe great accomplishment of the LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members: no general \npartner hangs out with liability exposure. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n560 \nLiability to Outsiders \nMembers are not liable to third parties for contracts made by the firm or for torts committed in the scope \nof business (but of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless of the owner’s level of \nparticipation—unlike a limited partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties’ only \nrecourse is as against the firm’s property. See Puleo v. Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

This is similar to a partnership. However, in a manager-managed LLC, only the managers have the authority to bind the firm, and they bear the duty of care and fiduciary duty. The non-manager members typically do not share these responsibilities. Furthermore, LLCs do not require annual meetings or minutes to be kept, unlike corporations.

This means that members' personal assets are protected from claims against the LLC. However, members are still liable for their own torts and cannot be held responsible for the torts of others, except in cases of gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or knowing violations of the law.

Recognize other business forms: sub-S corporations, limited liability partnerships, and limited liability \nlimited partnerships. \n \n \nSub-S Corporation \nHistory \nThe sub-S corporation or the S corporation gets its name from the IRS Code, Chapter 1, Subchapter S. It \nwas authorized by Congress in 1958 to help small corporations and to stem the economic and cultural \ninfluence of the relatively few, but increasingly powerful, huge multinational corporations. According to \nthe website of an S corporation champion, “a half century later, S corporations are the most popular \ncorporate structure in America. The IRS estimates that there were 4.5 million S corporation owners in the \nUnited States in 2007—about twice the number of C [standard] corporations.” [1] \n \nCreation and Capitalization \nThe S corporation is a regular corporation created upon application to the appropriate secretary of state’s \noffice and operated according to its bylaws and shareholders’ agreements. There are, however, some limits \non how the business is set up, among them the following: \n \n• \nIt must be incorporated in the United States. \n• \nIt cannot have more than one hundred shareholders (a married couple counts as one \nshareholder). \n• \nThe only shareholders are individuals, estates, certain exempt organizations, or certain trusts. \n• \nOnly US citizens and resident aliens may be shareholders. \n• \nThe corporation has only one class of stock. \n• \nWith some exceptions, it cannot be a bank, thrift institution, or insurance company. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n565 \n• \nAll shareholders must consent to the S corporation election. \n• \nIt is capitalized as is a regular corporation. \n \nLiability \nThe owners of the S corporation have limited liability. \n \nTaxation \nTaxation is the crux of the matter. The S corporation pays no corporate income tax (unless it has a lot of \npassive income). The S corporation’s shareholders include on their personal income statements, and pay \ntax on, their share of the corporation’s separately stated items of income, deduction, and loss. That is, the \nS corporation avoids the dreaded double taxation of corporate income. \n \nTransferability of Ownership \nS corporations’ shares can be bought or sold via share purchase agreements, and all changes in the \nownership are reflected in the share ledger in the corporate minute book. \n \nLimited Liability Partnerships \nBackground \nIn 1991, Texas enacted the first limited liability partnership (LLP) statute, largely in response to the \nliability that had been imposed on partners in partnerships sued by government agencies in relation to \nmassive savings and loan failures in the 1980s.

Typically, it could be defined either by the number of members who consent to the transfer or by the proportion of their combined membership value. This flexibility allows LLC owners to tailor the transfer process to fit their operational needs while still adhering to the principle of not having freely transferable interests. However, the LLC agreement might also stipulate that only the managing partners need to give their consent, or that transfers of interests in one class of membership require the approval of another class. These nuances reflect the ongoing effort to balance the desire for greater control and liquidity with the need to maintain some level of restriction on the transferability of interests."

This means that LLCs typically have provisions in their operating agreements that restrict the ability to freely transfer ownership interests without the consent of other members or managers. In contrast, corporations generally allow for more flexible transferability of shares, which can lead to a perception of greater liquidity and ease of ownership transfer. By maintaining these restrictions, LLCs can retain characteristics that are more favorable for small businesses, such as pass-through taxation and limited liability, without fully adopting the corporate form and its associated regulatory burdens."

A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5] \n \nIn the discussion of limited partnerships, we noted that ULPA-2001 eliminates the “control rule” so that \nlimited partners who exercise day-to-day control are not thereby liable as general partners. Now, in the \nsection quoted in the previous paragraph, the general partner’s liability for partnership obligations is \nvaporized too. (Of course, the general partner is liable for its, his, or her own torts.) The preface to ULPA-\n2001 explains, “In a limited liability limited partnership (‘LLLP’), no partner—whether general or \nlimited—is liable on account of partner status for the limited partnership’s obligations. Both general and \nlimited partners benefit from a full, status-based liability shield that is equivalent to the shield enjoyed by \ncorporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in an LLP.” \n \nPresumably, most existing limited partnerships will switch over to LLLPs. The ULPA-2001 provides that \n“the Act makes LLLP status available through a simple statement in the certificate of limited partnership.” \n \nEthical Concerns \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n568 \nThere was a reason that partnership law imposed personal liability on the partners: people tend to be \nmore careful when they are personally liable for their own mistakes and bad judgment. Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears. [6] Whether the movement to allow almost anybody the right to a business organization that affords \nlimited liability will encourage entrepreneurship and business activity or whether it will usher in a new \nera of moral hazard—people being allowed to escape the consequences of their own irresponsibility—is \nyet to be seen. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBusinesspeople always prefer to reduce their risks. The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The principal disadvantage of the general partnership is that it imposes unlimited personal liability on the \npartners. What is the disadvantage of the corporate form? \n2. Why isn’t the limited partnership an entirely satisfactory solution to the liability problem of the \npartnership? \n3.

                    "answer": "The Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA-2001) significantly alters the liability landscape for partners in a limited liability limited partnership (LLLP). Under ULPA-2001, no partner, whether general or limited, is held personally liable for the limited partnership's obligations simply due to their partner status. This means both general and limited partners receive a comprehensive, status-based liability protection akin to what corporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in a limited liability partnership (LLP) enjoy. The act effectively removes the risk of unlimited personal liability for all partners in an LLLP, as outlined in Section 404(c) which stipulates that any obligations of a limited partnership incurred during its existence as an LLLP are solely the responsibility of the limited partnership itself, with no direct or indirect personal liability extending to the general partner. This change underscores the shift towards a more investor-friendly environment where the personal risks associated with partnership involvement are minimized, aligning closely with the broader trend of expanding limited liability protections in various business structures."

Union Properties, Inc. \n562 P.2d 244 (Wash. 1977) \n \nPlaintiff [Frigidaire] entered into a contract with Commercial Investors (Commercial), a limited \npartnership. Defendants, Leonard Mannon and Raleigh Baxter, were limited partners of Commercial. \nDefendants were also officers, directors, and shareholders of Union Properties, Inc., the only general \npartner of Commercial. Defendants controlled Union Properties, and through their control of Union \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n570 \nProperties they exercised the day-to-day control and management of Commercial. Commercial breached \nthe contract, and Plaintiff brought suit against Union Properties and Defendants. The trial court \nconcluded that Defendants did not incur general liability for Commercial’s obligations by reason of their \ncontrol of Commercial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. \n \n[Plaintiff] does not contend that Defendants acted improperly by setting up the limited partnership with a \ncorporation as the sole general partner. Limited partnerships are a statutory form of business \norganization, and parties creating a limited partnership must follow the statutory requirements. In \nWashington, parties may form a limited partnership with a corporation as the sole general partner. \n[Citations] \n \nPlaintiff’s sole contention is that Defendants should incur general liability for the limited partnership’s \nobligations under RCW 25.08.070, because they exercised the day-to-day control and management of \nCommercial. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that Commercial was controlled by Union Properties, a \nseparate legal entity, and not by Defendants in their individual capacities. [RCW 25.08.070 then read: “A \nlimited partner shall not become liable as a general partner unless, in addition to the exercise of his rights \nand powers as limited partner, he takes part in the control of the business.”] \n \n…The pattern of operation of Union Properties was to investigate and conceive of real estate investment \nopportunities and, when it found such opportunities, to cause the creation of limited partnerships with \nUnion Properties acting as the general partner. Commercial was only one of several limited partnerships \nso conceived and created. Defendants did not form Union Properties for the sole purpose of operating \nCommercial. Hence, their acts on behalf of Union Properties were not performed merely for the benefit of \nCommercial.… \n \n[P]etitioner was never led to believe that Defendants were acting in any capacity other than in their \ncorporate capacities. The parties stipulated at the trial that Defendants never acted in any direct, personal \ncapacity. When the shareholders of a corporation, who are also the corporation’s officers and directors, \nconscientiously keep the affairs of the corporation separate from their personal affairs, and no fraud or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n571 \nmanifest injustice is perpetrated upon third persons who deal with the corporation, the corporation’s \nseparate entity should be respected. [Citations] \n \nFor us to find that Defendants incurred general liability for the limited partnership’s obligations under \nRCW 25.08.070 would require us to apply a literal interpretation of the statute and totally ignore the \ncorporate entity of Union Properties, when Plaintiff knew it was dealing with that corporate entity. There \ncan be no doubt that Defendants, in fact, controlled the corporation. However, they did so only in their \ncapacities as agents for their principal, the corporate general partner. Although the corporation was a \nseparate entity, it could act only through its board of directors, officers, and agents. [Citations] Plaintiff \nentered into the contract with Commercial. Defendants signed the contract in their capacities as president \nand secretary-treasurer of Union Properties, the general partner of Commercial. In the eyes of the law it \nwas Union Properties, as a separate corporate entity, which entered into the contract with Plaintiff and \ncontrolled the limited partnership. \nFurther, because Defendants scrupulously separated their actions on behalf of the corporation from their \npersonal actions, Plaintiff never mistakenly assumed that Defendants were general partners with general \nliability. [Citations] Plaintiff knew Union Properties was the sole general partner and did not rely on \nDefendants’ control by assuming that they were also general partners.

However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589 \nNew Jersey led the way in 1875 with a general incorporation statute that greatly liberalized the powers of \nmanagement and lifted many of the former restrictions.

It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws.

The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble \nAct in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one \nhundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies.

Know how partnerships and corporations are taxed. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n591 \nLet us assume that three people have already formed a partnership to run a bookstore business. Bob \nhas contributed $80,000. Carol has contributed a house in which the business can lawfully operate. \nTed has contributed his services; he has been managing the bookstore, and the business is showing a \nslight profit. A friend has been telling them that they ought to incorporate. What are the major \nfactors they should consider in reaching a decision? \n \nEase of Formation \nPartnerships are easy to form. If the business is simple enough and the partners are few, the agreement \nneed not even be written down. Creating a corporation is more complicated because formal documents \nmust be placed on file with public authorities. \n \nOwnership and Control \nAll general partners have equal rights in the management and conduct of the business. By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over \ncorporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the \nofficers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control \nmay be less pronounced or even nonexistent. \n \nTransferability of Interests \nTransferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member \nunless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership \nagreement. Transfer of interest in a corporation, through a sale of stock, is much easier; but for the \nstock of a small corporation, there might not be a market or there might be contractual restrictions on \ntransfer. \n \nFinancing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n592 \nPartners have considerable flexibility in financing. They can lure potential investors by offering interests \nin profits and, in the case of general partnerships, control. Corporations can finance by selling freely \ntransferable stock to the public or by incurring debt. Different approaches to the financing of corporations \nare discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". \n \nTaxation \nThe partnership is a conduit for income and is not taxed as a separate entity. Individual partners are \ntaxed, and although limited by the 1986 Tax Reform Act, they can deduct partnership losses. Corporate \nearnings, on the other hand, are subject to double taxation. The corporation is first taxed on its own \nearnings as an entity. Then, when profits are distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, the \nshareholders are taxed again. (A small corporation, with no more than one hundred shareholders, can \nelect S corporation status. Because S corporations are taxed as partnerships, they avoid double taxation.) \nHowever, incorporating brings several tax benefits. For example, the corporation can take deductions for \nlife, medical, and disability insurance coverage for its employees, whereas partners or sole proprietors \ncannot. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nPartnerships are easier to form than corporations, especially since no documents are required. General \npartners share both ownership and control, but in publicly held corporations, these functions are separated. \nAdditional benefits for a partnership include flexibility in financing, single taxation, and the ability to deduct \nlosses. Transfer of interest in a partnership can be difficult if not addressed in the initial agreement, since all \npartners must consent to the transfer. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "The key differences between forming a partnership and a corporation lie in ease of formation, ownership and control, transferability of interests, and taxation. Partnerships are relatively easy to form, requiring only an agreement among the partners, while creating a corporation involves more complex formal documents that need to be filed with public authorities. In terms of ownership and control, general partners in a partnership have equal rights in managing the business, whereas in a corporation, ownership and control are typically separated. Ownership is widely dispersed in publicly held corporations due to the large number of outstanding shares, making it difficult for any single shareholder to exert control. In closely held corporations, where there are few shareholders, the officers or senior managers often hold significant ownership, leading to a less pronounced or nonexistent separation of ownership and control. Regarding transferability of interests, transferring an interest in a partnership can be problematic unless all partners consent, whereas transferring shares in a corporation is generally easier. However, for small corporations, there may be a lack of market for the stock or contractual restrictions on transfer. Finally, partnerships are not taxed as separate entities, and individual partners are taxed on their share of profits, allowing them to deduct partnership losses. Corporations, on the other hand, are subject to double taxation, where earnings are taxed at the corporate level and then again when distributed as dividends to shareholders. Incorporating offers several tax benefits, such as the ability for corporations to take deductions for life, medical, and disability insurance coverage for employees, which is not available to partners or sole proprietors."

Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work. Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business.",

                    "answer": "The Dartmouth College case was significant because it addressed the question of whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The case involved the New Hampshire legislature's attempt to change the membership of Dartmouth College's board, turning it into a public institution. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature's action was unconstitutional, as amending a charter impairs a contract. This decision implied that once a corporation had been created, the state could not modify the powers it had been granted. However, this ruling also seemed to favor monopolies, as it suggested that a state could not create a second railroad corporation if it had already granted a charter to one, since a competitor would reduce the value of the original charter. To address this concern, Justice Joseph Story suggested that the states should write explicit language into the charter granting the legislature the authority to modify corporations' charters at their pleasure. As a result, states quickly adopted this approach, ensuring that the potential immutability of corporate charters had little practical chance to develop. In the context of choosing a state for incorporation, Delaware became the preferred choice due to its favorable tax climate, lack of minimum capital requirements, and a well-established legal system. This made it an attractive option for many corporations seeking to incorporate."

Distinguish between a de jure and a de facto corporation. \n2. Define the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. \n \n \nDe Jure and De Facto Corporations \nIf promoters meet the requirements of corporate formation, a de jure corporation, considered a legal \nentity, is formed. Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

Unlike de facto corporations, which arise from a genuine attempt to comply with the statutory requirements but fail to do so, a corporation by estoppel occurs when one party conducts themselves as if a corporation exists, leading to a legal recognition of its existence. This principle ensures equity and prevents someone from denying the existence of a corporation after having acted as if it existed, such as accepting deeds or entering into contracts."

Bestfoods \n113 F.3d 572 (1998) \n \nSOUTER, JUSTICE \n \nThe United States brought this action under §107(a)(2) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) against, among others, respondent CPC International, \nInc., the parent corporation of the defunct Ott Chemical Co. (Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal. Applying that test, the court held CPC \nliable because CPC had selected Ott II’s board of directors and populated its executive ranks with CPC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n615 \nofficials, and another CPC official had played a significant role in shaping Ott II’s environmental \ncompliance policy. \nThe Sixth Circuit reversed. Although recognizing that a parent company might be held directly liable \nunder §107(a)(2) if it actually operated its subsidiary’s facility in the stead of the subsidiary, or alongside \nof it as a joint venturer, that court refused to go further. Rejecting the District Court’s analysis, the Sixth \nCircuit explained that a parent corporation’s liability for operating a facility ostensibly operated by its \nsubsidiary depends on whether the degree to which the parent controls the subsidiary and the extent and \nmanner of its involvement with the facility amount to the abuse of the corporate form that will warrant \npiercing the corporate veil and disregarding the separate corporate entities of the parent and subsidiary. \nApplying Michigan veil-piercing law, the court decided that CPC was not liable for controlling Ott II’s \nactions, since the two corporations maintained separate personalities and CPC did not utilize the \nsubsidiary form to perpetrate fraud or subvert justice. \n \nHeld: \n1. When (but only when) the corporate veil may be pierced, a parent corporation may be charged with \nderivative CERCLA liability for its subsidiary’s actions in operating a polluting facility. It is a general \nprinciple of corporate law that a parent corporation (so-called because of control through ownership of \nanother corporation’s stock) is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. CERCLA does not purport to reject \nthis bedrock principle, and the Government has indeed made no claim that a corporate parent is liable as \nan owner or an operator under §107(a)(2) simply because its subsidiary owns or operates a polluting \nfacility. But there is an equally fundamental principle of corporate law, applicable to the parent-subsidiary \nrelationship as well as generally, that the corporate veil may be pierced and the shareholder held liable for \nthe corporation’s conduct when, inter alia, the corporate form would otherwise be misused to accomplish \ncertain wrongful purposes, most notably fraud, on the shareholder’s behalf. CERCLA does not purport to \nrewrite this well-settled rule, either, and against this venerable common-law backdrop, the congressional \nsilence is audible. Cf. Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 443 U.S. 256, 266-267. \nCERCLA’s failure to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership \ndemands application of the rule that, to abrogate a common-law principle, a statute must speak directly to \nthe question addressed by the common law. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n616 \n \n2. A corporate parent that actively participated in, and exercised control over, the operations of its \nsubsidiary’s facility may be held directly liable in its own right under §107(a)(2) as an operator of the \nfacility. \n \n(a) Derivative liability aside, CERCLA does not bar a parent corporation from direct liability for its own \nactions. Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility.

To sharpen the definition for purposes of CERCLA’s concern with \nenvironmental contamination, an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related \nto the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental \nregulations. \n \n(b) The Sixth Circuit correctly rejected the direct liability analysis of the District Court, which mistakenly \nfocused on the relationship between parent and subsidiary, and premised liability on little more than \nCPC’s ownership of Ott II and its majority control over Ott II’s board of directors. Because direct liability \nfor the parent’s operation of the facility must be kept distinct from derivative liability for the subsidiary’s \noperation of the facility, the analysis should instead have focused on the relationship between CPC and \nthe facility itself, i.e., on whether CPC “operated” the facility, as evidenced by its direct participation in the \nfacility’s activities. That error was compounded by the District Court’s erroneous assumption that actions \nof the joint officers and directors were necessarily attributable to CPC, rather than Ott II, contrary to time-\nhonored common-law principles. The District Court’s focus on the relationship between parent and \nsubsidiary (rather than parent and facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actions of dual \nofficers and directors to CPC, erroneously, even if unintentionally, treated CERCLA as though it displaced \nor fundamentally altered common-law standards of limited liability. The District Court’s analysis created \nwhat is in essence a relaxed, CERCLA-specific rule of derivative liability that would banish traditional \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n617 \nstandards and expectations from the law of CERCLA liability. Such a rule does not arise from \ncongressional silence, and CERCLA’s silence is dispositive. \n \n(c) Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit erred in limiting direct liability under CERCLA to a parent’s sole or joint \nventure operation, so as to eliminate any possible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the facts of \nthis case. The ordinary meaning of the word “operate” in the organizational sense is not limited to those \ntwo parental actions, but extends also to situations in which, e.g., joint officers or directors conduct the \naffairs of the facility on behalf of the parent, or agents of the parent with no position in the subsidiary \nmanage or direct activities at the subsidiary’s facility. Norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by any \nCERCLA provision) are crucial reference points, both for determining whether a dual officer or director \nhas served the parent in conducting operations at the facility, and for distinguishing a parental officer’s \noversight of a subsidiary from his control over the operation of the subsidiary’s facility. There is, in fact, \nsome evidence that an agent of CPC alone engaged in activities at Ott II’s plant that were eccentric under \naccepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary’s facility: The District Court’s opinion speaks of such \nan agent who played a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the plant’s \noperation. The findings in this regard are enough to raise an issue of CPC’s operation of the facility, \nthough this Court draws no ultimate conclusion, leaving the issue for the lower courts to reevaluate and \nresolve in the first instance. \n \n113 F.3d 572, vacated and remanded. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Graziano \n355 A.2d. 830 (1976) \n \nEAGEN, JUSTICE. \n \nOn April 30, 1970, RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. [RKO], as seller, entered into an agreement of sale \nwith Jack Jenofsky and Ralph Graziano, as purchasers. This agreement contemplated the sale of the Kent \nTheatre, a parcel of improved commercial real estate located at Cumberland and Kensington Avenues in \nPhiladelphia, for a total purchase price of $70,000. Settlement was originally scheduled for September \n30, 1970, and, at the request of Jenofsky and Graziano, continued twice, first to October 16, 1970, and \nthen to October 21, 1970. However, Jenofsky and Graziano failed to complete settlement on the last \nscheduled date. \n \nSubsequently, on November 13, 1970, RKO filed a complaint in equity seeking judicial enforcement of the \nagreement of sale. Although Jenofsky, in his answer to the complaint, denied personal liability for the \nperformance of the agreement, the chancellor, after a hearing, entered a decree nisi granting the \nrequested relief sought by RKO.…This appeal ensued. \nAt the time of the execution of this agreement, Jenofsky and Graziano were engaged in promoting the \nformation of a corporation to be known as Kent Enterprises, Inc. Reflecting these efforts, Paragraph 19 of \nthe agreement, added by counsel for Jenofsky and Graziano, recited: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n619 \nIt is understood by the parties hereto that it is the intention of the Purchaser to incorporate. Upon \ncondition that such incorporation be completed by closing, all agreements, covenants, and warranties \ncontained herein shall be construed to have been made between Seller and the resultant corporation and \nall documents shall reflect same. \n \nIn fact, Jenofsky and Graziano did file Articles of Incorporation for Kent Enterprises, Inc., with the State \nCorporation Bureau on October 9, 1971, twelve days prior to the scheduled settlement date. Jenofsky now \ncontends the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation \npapers, released him from any personal liability resulting from the non-performance of the agreement. \n \nThe legal relationship of Jenofsky to Kent Enterprises, Inc., at the date of the execution of the agreement \nof sale was that of promoter. As such, he is subject to the general rule that a promoter, although he may \nassume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on \ncontracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will \ncontinue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, \nunless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. \n \nThe imposition of personal liability upon a promoter where that promoter has contracted on behalf of a \ncorporation is based upon the principle that one who assumes to act for a nonexistent principal is himself \nliable on the contract in the absence of an agreement to the contrary. \n \n[T]here [are] three possible understandings that parties may have when an agreement is executed by a \npromoter on behalf of a proposed corporation: \nWhen a party is acting for a proposed corporation, he cannot, of course, bind it by anything he does, at the \ntime, but he may (1) take on its behalf an offer from the other which, being accepted after the formation of \nthe company, becomes a contract; (2) make a contract at the time binding himself, with the stipulation or \nunderstanding, that if a company is formed it will take his place and that then he shall be relieved of \nresponsibility; or (3) bind himself personally without more and look to the proposed company, when \nformed, for indemnity. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n620 \n \nBoth RKO and Jenofsky concede the applicability of alternative No. 2 to the instant case.

                    "answer": "The legal principle governing a promoter's liability for contracts made on behalf of a proposed corporation is that a promoter, although he may assume to act on behalf of a projected corporation and not for himself, will be held personally liable on contracts made by him for the benefit of a corporation he intends to organize. This personal liability will continue even after the contemplated corporation is formed and has received the benefits of the contract, unless there is a novation or other agreement to release liability. In the case of RKO and Jenofsky, both parties conceded the applicability of alternative No. 2, meaning Jenofsky was initially personally responsible for the contract, with this responsibility to be released upon the formation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the scheduled closing date. However, the inclusion of Paragraph 19 in the agreement and the subsequent filing of incorporation papers did not explicitly release Jenofsky from personal liability, indicating that the parties' intent to release him was not clearly communicated and thus did not constitute a novation."

That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed, \nthe entire agreement is silent as to the effect the formation of the projected corporation would have upon \nthe personal liability of Jenofsky and Graziano. Because the agreement fails to provide expressly for the \nrelease of personal liability, it is, therefore, subject to more than one possible construction. \n \nIn Consolidated Tile and Slate Co. v. Fox, 410 Pa. 336,339,189 A.2d 228, 229 (1963), we stated that where \nan agreement is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, “it must be construed most \nstrongly against those who drew it.”…Instantly, the chancellor determined that the intent of the parties to \nthe agreement was to hold Jenofsky personally responsible until such time as a corporate entity was \nformed and until such time as that corporate entity adopted the agreement. We believe this construction \nrepresents the only rational and prudent interpretation of the parties’ intent. \n \nAs found by the court below, this agreement was entered into on the financial strength of Jenofsky and \nGraziano, alone as individuals. Therefore, it would have been illogical for RKO to have consented to the \nrelease of their personal liability upon the mere formation of a resultant corporation prior to closing. For \nit is a well-settled rule that a contract made by a promoter, even though made for and in the name of a \nproposed corporation, in the absence of a subsequent adoption (either expressly or impliedly) by the \ncorporation, will not be binding upon the corporation. If, as Jenofsky contends, the intent was to release \npersonal responsibility upon the mere incorporation prior to closing, the effect of the agreement would \nhave been to create the possibility that RKO, in the event of non-performance, would be able to hold no \nparty accountable: there being no guarantee that the resultant corporation would ratify the agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n621 \nWithout express language in the agreement indicating that such was the intention of the parties, we may \nnot attribute this intention to them. \n \nTherefore, we hold that the intent of the parties in entering into this agreement was to have Jenofsky and \nGraziano personally liable until such time as the intended corporation was formed and ratified the \nagreement. [And there is no evidence that Kent Enterprises ratified the agreement. The decree is \naffirmed.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Does a promoter’s personal liability continue even after the corporation is formed? Can he or she look to \nthe corporation for indemnity after the corporation is formed? \n2.

Cranson, Jr., was a partner in the business conducted by the Bureau and as such was \npersonally liable for its debts, the International Business Machines Corporation brought this action \nagainst Cranson for the balance due on electric typewriters purchased by the Bureau.

This means that unless the corporation later agrees to accept the terms of the contract, typically through ratification, the contract remains a personal obligation of the promoter.

Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a \ncorporation, through corporate bank accounts, with auditors maintaining corporate books and records, \nand under a lease entered into by the corporation for the office from which it operated its business. \nCranson was elected president and all transactions conducted by him for the corporation, including the \ndealings with I.B.M., were made as an officer of the corporation. At no time did he assume any personal \nobligation or pledge his individual credit to I.B.M. Due to an oversight on the part of the attorney, of \nwhich Cranson was not aware, the certificate of incorporation, which had been signed and acknowledged \nprior to May 1, 1961, was not filed until November 24, 1961. Between May 17 and November 8, the Bureau \npurchased eight typewriters from I.B.M., on account of which partial payments were made, leaving a \nbalance due of $4,333.40, for which this suit was brought. \n \nAlthough a question is raised as to the propriety of making use of a motion for summary judgment as the \nmeans of determining the issues presented by the pleadings, we think the motion was appropriate. Since \nthere was no genuine dispute as to the material facts, the only question was whether I.B.M. was entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law. The trial court found that it was, but we disagree. \n \nThe fundamental question presented by the appeal is whether an officer of a defectively incorporated \nassociation may be subjected to personal liability under the circumstances of this case. We think not. \n \nTraditionally, two doctrines have been used by the courts to clothe an officer of a defectively incorporated \nassociation with the corporate attribute of limited liability. The first, often referred to as the doctrine of de \nfacto corporations, has been applied in those cases where there are elements showing: (1) the existence of \nlaw authorizing incorporation; (2) an effort in good faith to incorporate under the existing law; and (3) \nactual use or exercise of corporate powers. The second, the doctrine of estoppel to deny the corporate \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n623 \nexistence, is generally employed where the person seeking to hold the officer personally liable has \ncontracted or otherwise dealt with the association in such a manner as to recognize and in effect admit its \nexistence as a corporate body. \n \n* * * \n \nThere is, as we see it, a wide difference between creating a corporation by means of the de facto doctrine \nand estopping a party, due to his conduct in a particular case, from setting up the claim of no \nincorporation. Although some cases tend to assimilate the doctrines of incorporation de facto and by \nestoppel, each is a distinct theory and they are not dependent on one another in their application. Where \nthere is a concurrence of the three elements necessary for the application of the de facto corporation \ndoctrine, there exists an entity which is a corporation de jure against all persons but the state. \n \nOn the other hand, the estoppel theory is applied only to the facts of each particular case and may be \ninvoked even where there is no corporation de facto. Accordingly, even though one or more of the \nrequisites of a de facto corporation are absent, we think that this factor does not preclude the application \nof the estoppel doctrine in a proper case, such as the one at bar. \n \nI.B.M. contends that the failure of the Bureau to file its certificate of incorporation debarred all corporate \nexistence. But, in spite of the fact that the omission might have prevented the Bureau from being either a \ncorporation de jure or de facto, Jones v. Linden Building Ass’n, we think that I.B.M. having dealt with the \nBureau as if it were a corporation and relied on its credit rather than that of Cranson, is estopped to assert \nthat the Bureau was not incorporated at the time the typewriters were purchased. In 1 Clark and Marshall, \nPrivate Corporations, § 89, it is stated: \n \nThe doctrine in relation to estoppel is based upon the ground that it would generally be \ninequitable to permit the corporate existence of an association to be denied by persons who have \nrepresented it to be a corporation, or held it out as a corporation, or by any persons who have \nrecognized it as a corporation by dealing with it as such; and by the overwhelming weight of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n624",

Specifically, the court ruled that even though the Bureau (the defendant) failed to file its certificate of incorporation, IBM (the plaintiff) was estopped from denying the corporate existence of the Bureau because IBM had dealt with the Bureau as a corporation and relied on its credit rather than that of Cranson. This decision indicates that if a corporation is recognized and dealt with as a corporate entity, the doctrine of estoppel can prevent the denial of its corporate status, thereby protecting officers from personal liability."

The primary reason for this recommendation is the limited liability protection offered by a corporation. In a corporation, shareholders generally have limited liability, meaning that their personal assets are protected from claims made against the corporation. If the firm faces legal challenges or lawsuits, the personal assets of the shareholders (Laverne and Shirley) would typically not be at risk, provided that the corporation follows proper procedures and maintains adequate separation between personal and business affairs. This differs significantly from a partnership, where partners can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business."

Legally, the corporation does not yet exist until the incorporation process is fully completed, which means that Laverne's actions would likely be considered individual rather than corporate acts. As a result, Laverne could be personally liable for any obligations or liabilities arising from the contract. However, once the corporation formally accepts the contract, Laverne's personal liability would generally be transferred to the corporation, assuming the contract is properly ratified and accepted. It is crucial for Laverne and Shirley to ensure that all necessary steps for incorporating the business are completed before engaging in significant business activities to protect both the corporation and themselves from potential personal liability."

A corporation may have too much debt and would prefer to \nraise funds through a sale of stock rather than increasing its debt. The total costs of selling stock are often \nlower than financing through debt: the IPO may be expensive, but debt costs can vastly exceed the IPO \ncost because of the interest payments on the debt. Also, IPOs are a popular method of increasing a firm’s \nexposure, bringing the corporation many more investors and increasing its public image. Issuing stock is \nalso beneficial for the corporation because the corporation can use shares as compensation; for example, \nemployment compensation may be in the form of stock, such as in an employee stock ownership plan. \nInvestors also seek common stock, whether in an IPO or in the secondary market. While common stock is \na riskier investment than a bond, stock ownership can have tremendous upside—after all, the sky is the \nlimit on the price of a stock. On the other hand, there is the downside: the price of the stock can plummet, \ncausing the shareholder significant monetary loss. \n \nCertainly, an IPO has some disadvantages. Ownership is diluted: BCT had very few owners before its IPO \nbut may have millions of owners after the IPO. As mentioned, an IPO can be expensive. An IPO can also \nbe undervalued: the corporation and its investment banks may undervalue the IPO stock price, causing \nthe corporation to lose out on the difference between its determined price and the market price. Being a \npublic corporation also places the corporation under the purview of the SEC and requires ongoing \ndisclosures. Timing can be problematic: the registration review process can take several weeks. The stock \nmarkets can change drastically over that waiting period. Furthermore, the offering could have insufficient \npurchasers to raise sufficient funds; that is, the public might not have enough interest in purchasing the \ncompany’s stock to bring in sufficient funds to the corporation. Finally, a firm that goes public releases \ninformation that is available to the public, which could be useful to competitors (trade secrets, \ninnovations, new technology, etc.). \n \nAs mentioned, one of the main disadvantages of going public is the SEC review and disclosure \nrequirements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs most secondary market transactions. The \n1934 act places certain requirements on corporations that have sold securities. Both the 1933 and 1934 \nacts require corporations to disseminate information to the public and/or its investors. These \nrequirements were strengthened after the collapse of Enron in 2001. The SEC realized that its disclosure \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n645 \nrequirements were not strong enough, as demonstrated by the accounting tricks and downfall of Enron \nand its accountant, Arthur Andersen. [1] \n \nAs a result of Enron’s accounting scandal, as well as problems with other corporations, Congress \ntightened the noose by passing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. [2] This act increased the disclosure of \nfinancial information, increased transparency, and required the dissemination of information about what \na corporation was doing. For example, Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a corporation’s chief \nexecutive officer and chief financial officer certify annual and quarterly reports and state that the report \ndoes not contain any material falsehoods and that the financial data accurately reflect the corporation’s \ncondition. \n \nNature of the Consideration \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. While cash is commonly used to purchase \nstock, a stock purchaser may pay with something other than cash, such as property, whether tangible or \nintangible, or services or labor performed for the corporation. In most states, promissory notes and \ncontracts for future services are not lawful forms of consideration. The case United Steel Industries, Inc. \nv. Manhart, (see Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), illustrates the problems that can \narise when services or promises of future delivery are intended as payment for stock. \n \n \nEvaluating the Consideration: Watered Stock \nIn United Steel Industries (Section 15.7.1 \"Consideration in Exchange for Stock\"), assume that Griffitts’s \nlegal services had been thought by the corporation to be worth $6,000 but in fact were worth $1,000, and \nthat he had received stock with par value of $6,000 (i.e., 6,000 shares of $1 par value stock) in exchange \nfor his services. Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646",

Investors also find common stock appealing despite its higher risk compared to bonds, as it offers significant potential for growth. However, there are several disadvantages, such as the dilution of ownership, high costs associated with the IPO process, potential undervaluation leading to lost revenue, regulatory scrutiny and ongoing disclosure requirements enforced by the SEC, the risk of market fluctuations during the registration review process, and the possibility of insufficient demand for the stock, which can hinder the company's fundraising efforts.

It introduced stricter regulations, including the requirement for corporate executives to personally certify the accuracy of financial statements. Prior to this, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 already mandated that corporations provide certain information to the public and investors. Following the Enron scandal, the SEC recognized the inadequacy of these existing disclosure rules, which had allowed companies like Enron to engage in complex accounting practices that concealed financial mismanagement. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addressed these shortcomings by enhancing the scope and rigor of corporate disclosures, ensuring that financial data truly reflected the company's condition, and holding executives accountable for the accuracy of these disclosures."

Baltimore Brick Co., 35 Del. Ch. 225; 114 A.2d 812 (Del. 1955). \n \n \n \n15.6 The Winds of Change \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Know the modern changes to corporate finance terminology and specific requirements imposed by states. \n2. Compare the application of the Uniform Commercial Code to corporate finance with the applicability of the \n1933 and 1934 federal securities acts. \n \n \nChanges in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n653 \nPerhaps the most dramatic innovations incorporated into the Revised Model Business Corporation Act \n(RMBCA) are the financial provisions. The revisions recommend eliminating concepts such as par value \nstock, no-par stock, stated capital, capital surplus, earned surplus, and treasury shares. It was felt that \nthese concepts—notably par value and stated capital—no longer serve their original purpose of protecting \ncreditors. \n \nA key definition under the revisions is that of distributions—that is, any transfer of money or property to \nthe shareholders. In order to make distributions, a corporation must meet the traditional insolvency test \nand balance sheet tests. Under the balance sheet test, corporate assets must be greater than or equal to \nliabilities and liquidation preferences on senior equity. The RMBCA also provides that promissory notes \nand contracts for future services may be used in payment for shares. \n \nIt is important to note that the RMBCA is advisory. Not every state has abandoned par value or the other \nfinancial terms. For example, Delaware is quite liberal with its requirements: \n \nEvery corporation may issue 1 or more classes of stock or 1 or more series of stock within any \nclass thereof, any or all of which classes may be of stock with par value or stock without par \nvalue and which classes or series may have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting \npowers, and such designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special \nrights, and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in \nthe certificate of incorporation or of any amendment thereto, or in the resolution or resolutions \nproviding for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors pursuant to authority \nexpressly vested in it by the provisions of its certificate of incorporation. [1] \n \nTherefore, although the modern trend is to move away from par value as well as some other previously \ndiscussed terms—and despite the RMBCA’s abandonment of these concepts—they still, in large measure, \npersist. \n \nIntroduction to Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n654 \nPartial ownership of a corporation would be an awkward investment if there were no ready means of \ntransfer. The availability of paper certificates as tangible evidence of the ownership of equity securities \nsolves the problem of what to transfer, but since a corporation must maintain records of its owners, a set \nof rules is necessary to spell out how transfers are to be made. That set of rules is Article 8 of the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC). Article 8 governs certificated securities, uncertificated securities, registration \nrequirements, transfer, purchase, and other specifics of securities. Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the",

In contrast, the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts are federal laws that regulate the primary issuance of securities and the secondary trading of securities, respectively. While both sets of laws address securities, the UCC focuses on the mechanics of transferring ownership through various forms of documentation and record-keeping, whereas the 1933 and 1934 acts focus on the legal requirements for issuing and trading securities across interstate commerce."

The board of directors and officers exercise much of the power. Shareholders exercise their power \nat meetings, typically through voting for directors. Statutes, bylaws, and the articles of incorporation \ndetermine how voting occurs—such as whether a quorum is sufficient to hold a meeting or whether voting is \ncumulative. Shareholders need not be present at a meeting—they may use a proxy to cast their votes or set \nup voting trusts or voting agreements. Shareholders may view corporate documents with proper demand and \na proper purpose.

Examine the responsibility of directors and the delegation of decisions. \n2. Discuss the qualifications, election, and removal of directors. \n3. Determine what requirements are placed on directors for meetings and compensation. \n \n \nGeneral Management Responsibility of the Directors \nDirectors derive their power to manage the corporation from statutory law. Section 8.01 of the Revised \nModel Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) states that “all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under \nthe authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, its board \nof directors.” A director is a fiduciary, a person to whom power is entrusted for another’s benefit, and as \nsuch, as the RMBCA puts it, must perform his duties “in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent \nperson in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances” (Section 8.30). A director’s main \nresponsibilities include the following: (1) to protect shareholder investments, (2) to select and remove \nofficers, (3) to delegate operating authority to the managers or other groups, and (4) to supervise the \ncompany as a whole. \n \n \n \nDelegation to Committees \nUnder RMBCA Section 8.25, the board of directors, by majority vote, may delegate its powers to various \ncommittees. This authority is limited to some degree. For example, only the full board can determine \ndividends, approve a merger, and amend the bylaws. The delegation of authority to a committee does not, \nby itself, relieve a director from the duty to exercise due care. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n681 \nDelegation to Officers \n \nFigure 16.2 The Corporate Governance Model \n \n \nThe directors often delegate to officers the day-to-day authority to execute the policies established by the \nboard and to manage the firm (see Figure 16.2 \"The Corporate Governance Model\"). Normally, the \npresident is the chief executive officer (CEO) to whom all other officers and employees report, but \nsometimes the CEO is also the chairman of the board. \n \nNumber and Election of Directors \nSection 8.03 of the RMBCA provides that there must be one director, but there may be more, the precise \nnumber to be fixed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting.

Under Section 8.70 of the RMBCA, directors owe a fiduciary duty to the corporation and must not engage in self-dealing or take corporate opportunities for personal gain. If a director like Ted, a director of BCT, attempts to take advantage of a corporate opportunity for personal gain, such as purchasing an ideal building for his own clothing business, this would be considered a breach of his fiduciary duty. A shareholder, like Sam, who discovers such actions could potentially have recourse through derivative actions, allowing them to sue on behalf of the corporation to seek remedies for the corporation's losses or to prevent further harm. This ensures that corporate opportunities are used for the benefit of the corporation rather than personal interests."

A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers.

The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to \nwhich we now turn. For further discussions of the business judgment rule, see Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, \nInc., [8] In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, [9] and Smith v. Van Gorkom. [10] \n \nIf a shareholder is not pleased by a director’s decision, that shareholder may file a derivative suit. The \nderivative suit may be filed by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against directors or officers of \nthe corporation, alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations. However, a shareholder, as a prerequisite to \nfiling a derivative action, must first demand that the board of directors take action, as the actual party in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n690 \ninterest is the corporation, not the shareholder (meaning that if the shareholder is victorious in the \nlawsuit, it is actually the corporation that “wins”). If the board refuses, is its decision protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule? The general rule is that the board may refuse to file a derivative suit and will be \nprotected by the business judgment rule. And even when a derivative suit is filed, directors can be \nprotected by the business judgment rule for decisions even the judge considers to have been poorly made. \nSee In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, (see Section 16.5.2 \"Business Judgment Rule\"). \n \nIn a battle for control of a corporation, directors (especially “inside” directors, who are employees of the \ncorporation, such as officers) often have an inherent self-interest in preserving their positions, which can \nlead them to block mergers that the shareholders desire and that may be in the firm’s best interest. As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum, [11] for instance, the court held that directors who adopt a defensive \nmechanism “must show that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy \nand effectiveness existed.…[T]hey satisfy that burden ‘by showing good faith and reasonable \ninvestigation.’” The business judgment rule clearly does not protect every decision of the board. \nThe Unocal court developed a test for the board: the directors may only work to prevent a takeover when \nthey can demonstrate a threat to the policies of the corporation and that any defensive measures taken to \nprevent the takeover were reasonable and proportional given the depth of the threat. The Unocal test was \nmodified further by requiring a finding, before a court steps in, that the actions of a board were coercive, a \nstep back toward the business judgment rule. [12] \n \nIn a widely publicized case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Time, Inc. met \nthe Unocal test—that the board reasonably concluded that a tender offer by Paramount constituted a \nthreat and acted reasonably in rejecting Paramount’s offer and in merging with Warner \nCommunications. [13] \n \nThe specific elements of the fiduciary duties are not spelled out in stone. For example, the Delaware \ncourts have laid out three factors to examine when determining whether a duty of care has been \nbreached: [14] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n691 \n \n1. The directors knew, or should have known, that legal breaches were occurring. \n2. The directors took no steps to prevent or resolve the situation. \n3. This failure caused the losses about which the shareholder is complaining in a derivative suit. \n \nThus the court expanded the duty of oversight (which is included under the umbrella of the duty of care; \nthese duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation.

In these cases, directors must show reasonable grounds for believing a danger to corporate policy and effectiveness exists, and their actions must be reasonable and proportional given the threat.

Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little. The court noted an exception to the general rule that permitted \ndirectors to consider the interests of other groups as long as “there are rationally related benefits accruing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n692 \nto the stockholders.” But when a company is about to be taken over, the object must be to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, Pantry Pride in this case. It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy. So \nbroadly worded are these laws that although the motive for enacting them was to give directors a weapon \nin fighting hostile tender offers, in some states the principle applies to any decision by a board of \ndirectors. So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies.

These laws aim to release directors from their formal legal obligation to prioritize shareholder interests above all else, providing them with more flexibility to balance different stakeholders' needs. However, critics argue that these statutes lack clear guidelines on how to weigh the interests of various constituencies and make it harder to enforce consistent standards."

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer.

Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated \npurpose is broader and this court cannot find that it is either necessary or convenient to that purpose for \nits membership to be restricted to men. It should be borne in mind that this club is one of the principal \nluncheon clubs for business and professional people in Stamford. It is a gathering place where a great \nmany of the civic, business, and professional affairs of the Stamford community are discussed in an \natmosphere of social intercourse. Given the scope of the entry of women today into the business and \nprofessional life of the community and the changing status of women before the law and in society, it \nwould be anomalous indeed for this court to conclude that it is either necessary or convenient to the \nstated purpose for which it was organized for this club to exclude women as members or guests. \n \nWhile the bylaws recognize the right of a member to bring guests to the club, the exclusion of women \nguests is nowhere authorized and would not appear to be any more necessary and convenient to the \npurpose of the club than the exclusion of women members. The bylaws at present contain no restrictions \nagainst female members or guests and even if they could be interpreted as authorizing those restrictions, \nthey would be of no validity in light of the requirement of § 33-459 (a) of the General Statutes, that the \nbylaws must be “reasonable [and] germane to the purposes of the corporation.…” \n \nThe court therefore concludes that the actions and policies of the defendants in excluding women as \nmembers and guests solely on the basis of sex is ultra vires and beyond the power of the corporation and \nits management under its certificate of incorporation and the Nonstock Corporation Act, and in \nderogation of the rights of the plaintiff as a member thereof.

Ch. 2005) \n \nJACOBS, Justice: \n \n[The Walt Disney Company hired Ovitz as its executive president and as a board member for five years \nafter lengthy compensation negotiations. The negotiations regarding Ovitz’s compensation were \nconducted predominantly by Eisner and two of the members of the compensation committee (a four-\nmember panel). The terms of Ovitz’s compensation were then presented to the full board. In a meeting \nlasting around one hour, where a variety of topics were discussed, the board approved Ovitz’s \ncompensation after reviewing only a term sheet rather than the full contract. Ovitz’s time at Disney was \ntumultuous and short-lived.]…In December 1996, only fourteen months after he commenced \nemployment, Ovitz was terminated without cause, resulting in a severance payout to Ovitz valued at \napproximately $ 130 million. [Disney shareholders then filed derivative actions on behalf of Disney \nagainst Ovitz and the directors of Disney at the time of the events complained of (the “Disney \ndefendants”), claiming that the $130 million severance payout was the product of fiduciary duty and \ncontractual breaches by Ovitz and of breaches of fiduciary duty by the Disney defendants and a waste of \nassets. The Chancellor found in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination.

Their inherent \nvalue lies in the interest in property or an ongoing enterprise that they represent. This disparity between \nthe tangible property—the stock certificate, for example—and the intangible interest it represents gives \nrise to several reasons for regulation. First, there is need for a mechanism to inform the buyer accurately \nwhat it is he is buying. Second, laws are necessary to prevent and provide remedies for deceptive and \nmanipulative acts designed to defraud buyers and sellers. Third, the evolution of stock trading on a \nmassive scale has led to the development of numerous types of specialists and professionals, in dealings \nwith whom the public can be at a severe disadvantage, and so the law undertakes to ensure that they do \nnot take unfair advantage of their customers.",

Recognize how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has amended the 1934 act to increase corporate regulation, \ntransparency, and penalties. \n \n \nCorporations may be found liable if they engage in certain unlawful practices, several of which we explore \nin this section. \n \nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nInvestigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Watergate Special Prosecutor in \nthe early 1970s turned up evidence that hundreds of companies had misused corporate funds, mainly by \nbribing foreign officials to induce them to enter into contracts with or grant licenses to US companies. \nBecause revealing the bribes would normally be self-defeating and, in any event, could be expected to stir \nup immense criticism, companies paying bribes routinely hid the payments in various accounts. As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country. More important than the foreign-bribe provisions, the \nact includes accounting provisions, which broaden considerably the authority of the SEC. These \nprovisions are discussed in SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., [1] the first accounting provisions \ncase brought to trial. \n \nInsider Trading \nCorporate insiders—directors, officers, or important shareholders—can have a substantial trading \nadvantage if they are privy to important confidential information.

In order to raise money to support its general business operations, the Co-Op sold promissory \nnotes payable on demand by the holder.

The Co-Op offered the notes to both members and nonmembers, marketing the \nscheme as an “Investment Program.” Advertisements for the notes, which appeared in each Co-Op \nnewsletter, read in part: “YOUR CO-OP has more than $11,000,000 in assets to stand behind your \ninvestments. The Investment is not Federal [sic] insured but it is…Safe…Secure…and available when you \nneed it.” App. 5 (ellipses in original). Despite these assurances, the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy in 1984.

There is, however, more than one way to demonstrate the causal connection. \n \n* * * \n \nPresumptions typically serve to assist courts in managing circumstances in which direct proof, for one \nreason or another, is rendered difficult.

Requiring a plaintiff to show a speculative \nstate of facts, i.e., how he would have acted if omitted material information had been disclosed, or if the \nmisrepresentation had not been made, would place an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the \nRule 10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market. \n \nArising out of considerations of fairness, public policy, and probability, as well as judicial economy, \npresumptions are also useful devices for allocating the burdens of proof between parties. The presumption \nof reliance employed in this case is consistent with, and, by facilitating Rule 10b-5 litigation, supports, the \ncongressional policy embodied in the 1934 Act.… \n \nThe presumption is also supported by common sense and probability. Recent empirical studies have \ntended to confirm Congress’ premise that the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets \nreflects all publicly available information, and, hence, any material misrepresentations. It has been noted \nthat “it is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity. Who \nwould knowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game?” Schlanger v.

What is the fraud-on-the-market theory? \n \n \n \n17.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond state corporation laws, federal statutes—most importantly, the Securities Act of 1933 and the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934—regulate the issuance and trading of corporate securities. The federal \ndefinition of security is broad, encompassing most investments, even those called by other names. \n \nThe law does not prohibit risky stock offerings; it bans only those lacking adequate disclosure of risks. The \nprimary means for realizing this goal is the registration requirement: registration statements, \nprospectuses, and proxy solicitations must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \nPenalties for violation of securities law include criminal fines and jail terms, and damages may be \nawarded in civil suits by both the SEC and private individuals injured by the violation of SEC rules. A 1977 \namendment to the 1934 act is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits an issuer from paying a \nbribe or making any other payment to foreign officials in order to gain business by inducing the foreign \nofficial to influence his government in favor of the US company. This law requires issuers to keep accurate \nsets of books reflecting the dispositions of their assets and to maintain internal accounting controls to \nensure that transactions comport with management’s authorization. \n \nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 presents special hazards to those trading in public stock on the basis \nof inside information. One provision requires the reimbursement to the company of any profits made \nfrom selling and buying stock during a six-month period by directors, officers, and shareholders owning \n10 percent or more of the company’s stock. Under Rule 10b-5, the SEC and private parties may sue \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n742 \ninsiders who traded on information not available to the general public, thus gaining an advantage in \neither selling or buying the stock. Insiders include company employees. \n \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act amended the 1934 act, creating more stringent penalties, increasing corporate \nregulation, and requiring greater transparency. \n \nEXERCISES",

                    "answer": "The fraud-on-the-market theory posits that in an efficient market, the price of a security reflects all publicly available information, including any material misrepresentations. This theory is significant in proving a plaintiff's reliance in a Rule 10b-5 cause of action because it allows courts to infer that investors relied on the integrity of the market price when they bought or sold securities. By accepting this presumption, plaintiffs do not need to prove specific instances of reliance, thereby reducing the evidentiary burden and supporting the congressional policy of ensuring fair and transparent financial markets. This theory is based on the assumption that investors trust the market's pricing mechanism, and thus, any material misrepresentations affect the market price, leading to reliance on such misinformation."

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock. In our example, if Flying Truckman has \nshareholders, BCT would make an offer directly to those shareholders to acquire their shares. \n \nTender Offers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n751 \nIn the case of closely held corporations, it is possible for a company bent on takeover to negotiate with \neach stockholder individually, making a direct offer to purchase his or her shares. That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days.

The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws.

The political \npremise of the laws was the protection of incumbent managers from takeover by out-of-state \ncorporations, although the “localness” of some managers was but a polite fiction. One such law was \nenacted in Illinois. It required notifying the Illinois secretary of state and the target corporation of the \nintent to make a tender offer twenty days prior to the offer. During that time, the corporation seeking to \nmake the tender offer could not spread information about the offer. Finally, the secretary of state could \ndelay the tender offer by ordering a hearing and could even deny the offer if it was deemed inequitable. In \n1982, the Supreme Court, in Edgar v. Mite Corp., struck down the Illinois takeover law because it violated \nthe Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unduly burdening the flow of interstate commerce, and \nalso was preempted by the Williams Act. [5] \n \nFollowing the Mite decision, states began to enact a second generation of takeover laws. In 1987, in CTS \nCorporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana second-\ngeneration statute that prevents an offeror who has acquired 20 percent or more of a target’s stock from \nvoting unless other shareholders (not including management) approve. The vote to approve can be \ndelayed for up to fifty days from the date the offeror files a statement reporting the acquisition. The Court \nconcluded that the Commerce Clause was not violated nor was the Williams Act, because the Indiana law, \nunlike the Illinois law in Mite, was consistent with the Williams Act, since it protects shareholders, does \nnot unreasonably delay the tender offer, and does not discriminate against interstate commerce. [6] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n753 \nEmboldened by the CTS decision, almost half the states have adopted a third-generation law that requires \na bidder to wait several years before merging with the target company unless the target’s board agrees in \nadvance to the merger. Because in many cases a merger is the reason for the bid, these laws are especially \npowerful. In 1989, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Wisconsin’s third-generation law, saying \nthat it did not violate the Commerce Clause and that it was not preempted by the Williams Act. The \nSupreme Court decided not to review the decision. [7] \n \nShort-Form Mergers \nIf one company acquires 90 percent or more of the stock of another company, it can merge with the target \ncompany through the so-called short-form merger. Only the parent company’s board of directors need \napprove the merger; consent of the shareholders of either company is unnecessary. \n \nAppraisal Rights \nIf a shareholder has the right to vote on a corporate plan to merge, consolidate, or sell all or substantially \nall of its assets, that shareholder has the right to dissent and invoke appraisal rights. Returning again to \nBCT, Bob and Carol, as shareholders, are anxious to acquire Flying Truckman, but Ted is not sure of the \nwisdom of doing that. Ted could invoke his appraisal rights to dissent from an expansion involving Flying \nTruckman. The law requires the shareholder to file with the corporation, before the vote, a notice of \nintention to demand the fair value of his shares. If the plan is approved and the shareholder does not vote \nin favor, the corporation must send a notice to the shareholder specifying procedures for obtaining \npayment, and the shareholder must demand payment within the time set in the notice, which cannot be \nless than thirty days. Fair value means the value of shares immediately before the effective date of the \ncorporate action to which the shareholder has objected. Appreciation and depreciation in anticipation of \nthe action are excluded, unless the exclusion is unfair. \n \nIf the shareholder and the company cannot agree on the fair value, the shareholder must file a petition \nrequesting a court to determine the fair value. The method of determining fair value depends on the \ncircumstances. When there is a public market for stock traded on an exchange, fair value is usually the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n754 \nprice quoted on the exchange. In some circumstances, other factors, especially net asset value and \ninvestment value—for example, earnings potential—assume greater importance. \n \nSee Hariton v. Arco Electronics, Inc.

These laws were upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Wisconsin, which stated that they did not violate the Commerce Clause and were not preempted by the Williams Act."

            "chunk": "Taxing Authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n758 \nMay states tax foreign corporations? Since a state may obviously tax its domestic corporations, the \nquestion might seem surprising. Why should a state ever be barred from taxing foreign corporations \nlicensed to do business in the state? If the foreign corporation was engaged in purely local, intrastate \nbusiness, no quarrel would arise. The constitutional difficulty is whether the tax constitutes an \nunreasonable burden on the company’s interstate business, in violation of the Commerce Clause. The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes. A state may tax a foreign corporation as long as it does \nnot burden interstate commerce. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n759 \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Minimum contacts are significant because they determine whether a state has the authority to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign corporation. For a state to tax a foreign corporation, the corporation must engage in certain activities that establish a sufficient connection or 'minimum contacts' with the state. This connection must be such that the corporation should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in that state. The concept of minimum contacts ensures that states cannot arbitrarily tax businesses operating in other states, thereby protecting interstate commerce from undue burdens. This principle is illustrated in cases like D.H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara, where the court established that a state can tax a foreign corporation as long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce."

Ltd. V. McNamara \n486 U.S. 24; 108 S.Ct. 1619, 100 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1988) \n \nAppellant D. H. Holmes Company, Ltd., is a Louisiana corporation with its principal place of business and \nregistered office in New Orleans. Holmes owns and operates 13 department stores in various locations \nthroughout Louisiana that employ about 5,000 workers. It has approximately 500,000 credit card \ncustomers and an estimated 1,000,000 other customers within the State. \n \nIn 1979–1981, Holmes contracted with several New York companies for the design and printing of \nmerchandise catalogs. The catalogs were designed in New York, but were actually printed in Atlanta, \nBoston, and Oklahoma City. From these locations, 82% of the catalogs were directly mailed to residents of \nLouisiana; the remainder of the catalogs was mailed to customers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida, or \nwas sent to Holmes for distribution at its flagship store on Canal Street in New Orleans. The catalogs were \nshipped free of charge to the addressee, and their entire cost (about $ 2 million for the 3-year period), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n767 \nincluding mailing, was borne by Holmes. Holmes did not, however, pay any sales tax where the catalogs \nwere designed or printed. \n \nAlthough the merchandise catalogs were mailed to selected customers, they contained instructions to the \npostal carrier to leave them with the current resident if the addressee had moved, and to return \nundeliverable catalogs to Holmes’ Canal Street store. Holmes freely concedes that the purpose of the \ncatalogs was to promote sales at its stores and to instill name recognition in future buyers. The catalogs \nincluded inserts which could be used to order Holmes’ products by mail. \n \nThe Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation, of which appellee is the current Secretary, \nconducted an audit of Holmes’ tax returns for 1979–1981 and determined that it was liable for delinquent \nuse taxes on the value of the catalogs. The Department of Revenue and Taxation assessed the use tax \npursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 47:302 and 47:321 (West 1970 and Supp. 1988), which are set forth in \nthe margin. Together, §§ 47:302(A)(2) and 47:321(A)(2) impose a use tax of 3% on all tangible personal \nproperty used in Louisiana. “Use,” as defined elsewhere in the statute, is the exercise of any right or power \nover tangible personal property incident to ownership, and includes consumption, distribution, and \nstorage. The use tax is designed to compensate the State for sales tax that is lost when goods are \npurchased out-of-state and brought for use into Louisiana, and is calculated on the retail price the \nproperty would have brought when imported. \n \nWhen Holmes refused to pay the use tax assessed against it, the State filed suit in Louisiana Civil District \nCourt to collect the tax. [The lower courts held for the State.]… \n \nThe Commerce Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, provides that Congress shall have the power \n“to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” \nEven where Congress has not acted affirmatively to protect interstate commerce, the Clause prevents \nStates from discriminating against that commerce. The “distinction between the power of the State to \nshelter its people from menaces to their health or safety and from fraud, even when those dangers \nemanate from interstate commerce, and its lack of power to retard, burden or constrict the flow of such \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n768 \ncommerce for their economic advantage, is one deeply rooted in both our history and our law.” H. P. \nHood & Sons v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 533, 93 L. Ed. 865, 69 S.Ct. 657 (1949). \n \nOne frequent source of conflict of this kind occurs when a State seeks to tax the sale or use of goods within \nits borders. This recurring dilemma is exemplified in what has come to be the leading case in the \narea. Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 51 L. Ed. 2d 326, 97 S.Ct. 1076 \n(1977). In Complete Auto, Mississippi imposed a tax on appellant’s business of in-state transportation of \nmotor vehicles manufactured outside the State. We found that the State’s tax did not violate the \nCommerce Clause, because appellant’s activity had a substantial nexus with Mississippi, and the tax was \nfairly apportioned, did not discriminate against interstate commerce, and was fairly related to benefits \nprovided by the State. \n \nComplete Auto abandoned the abstract notion that interstate commerce “itself” cannot be taxed by the \nStates. We recognized that, with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair \nshare of state taxes. Accordingly, in the present case, it really makes little difference for Commerce Clause \npurposes whether Holmes’ catalogs “came to rest” in the mailboxes of its Louisiana customers or whether",

Holmes Company, Ltd. violated the Commerce Clause included the substantial nexus between the activity and the taxing jurisdiction, fair apportionment, non-discrimination against interstate commerce, and the fairness of the tax in relation to the benefits provided by the state. Specifically, the Court looked at the fact that Holmes conducted business in Louisiana by operating 13 department stores, employing thousands of workers, and engaging in significant marketing activities within the state. Furthermore, the catalogs were mailed to Louisiana residents and the entire cost of the catalogs, including printing and mailing, was borne by Holmes. These factors established a sufficient connection between Holmes' activities and Louisiana to justify the imposition of the use tax. Additionally, the tax was not discriminatory as it applied equally to similar activities regardless of the origin of the catalogs. Lastly, the tax was deemed fair because it was based on the use of the catalogs within Louisiana and compensated the state for the loss of sales tax revenue due to the out-of-state purchases."

Accordingly, in the present case, it really makes little difference for Commerce Clause \npurposes whether Holmes’ catalogs “came to rest” in the mailboxes of its Louisiana customers or whether \nthey were still considered in the stream of interstate commerce.… \n \nIn the case before us, then, the application of Louisiana’s use tax to Holmes’ catalogs does not violate the \nCommerce Clause if the tax complies with the four prongs of Complete Auto. We have no doubt that the \nsecond and third elements of the test are satisfied. The Louisiana taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, for \nit provides a credit against its use tax for sales taxes that have been paid in other States. Holmes paid no \nsales tax for the catalogs where they were designed or printed; if it had, it would have been eligible for a \ncredit against the use tax exacted. Similarly, Louisiana imposed its use tax only on the 82% of the catalogs \ndistributed in-state; it did not attempt to tax that portion of the catalogs that went to out-of-state \ncustomers. \n \nThe Louisiana tax structure likewise does not discriminate against interstate commerce. The use tax is \ndesigned to compensate the State for revenue lost when residents purchase out-of-state goods for use \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n769 \nwithin the State. It is equal to the sales tax applicable to the same tangible personal property purchased \nin-state; in fact, both taxes are set forth in the same sections of the Louisiana statutes. \n \nComplete Auto requires that the tax be fairly related to benefits provided by the State, but that condition \nis also met here. Louisiana provides a number of services that facilitate Holmes’ sale of merchandise \nwithin the State: It provides fire and police protection for Holmes’ stores, runs mass transit and maintains \npublic roads which benefit Holmes’ customers, and supplies a number of other civic services from which \nHolmes profits. To be sure, many others in the State benefit from the same services; but that does not \nalter the fact that the use tax paid by Holmes, on catalogs designed to increase sales, is related to the \nadvantages provided by the State which aid Holmes’ business. \n \nFinally, we believe that Holmes’ distribution of its catalogs reflects a substantial nexus with Louisiana. To \nbegin with, Holmes’ contention that it lacked sufficient control over the catalogs’ distribution in Louisiana \nto be subject to the use tax verges on the nonsensical. Holmes ordered and paid for the catalogs and \nsupplied the list of customers to whom the catalogs were sent; any catalogs that could not be delivered \nwere returned to it. Holmes admits that it initiated the distribution to improve its sales and name \nrecognition among Louisiana residents. Holmes also has a significant presence in Louisiana, with 13 \nstores and over $100 million in annual sales in the State. The distribution of catalogs to approximately \n400,000 Louisiana customers was directly aimed at expanding and enhancing its Louisiana business. \nThere is “nexus” aplenty here.

Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There \nare two main types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. A consolidation is virtually the same \nas a merger, except that the resulting entity is a new corporation. \n \nA corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly \nreferred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using \nthe target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target. \nA shareholder has the right to fair value for his stock if he dissents from a plan to merge, consolidate, or \nsell all or substantially all of the corporate assets, referred to as appraisal rights. If there is disagreement \nover the value, the shareholder has the right to a court appraisal.

She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank. By adding that the note is negotiable, the",

It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786 \nA second type of commercial paper is the common bank check, a special form of draft. Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\". The \nmaker might execute a promissory note in return for a money loan from a bank or other financial \ninstitution or in return for the opportunity to make a purchase on credit. \n \nFigure 19.4 A Promissory Note \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n787 \n \n \nCertificates of Deposit \nA fourth type of commercial paper is the certificate of deposit, commonly called a CD. The CD is a \nwritten acknowledgment by a bank that it has received money and agrees to repay it at a time specified in \nthe certificate. The first negotiable CD was issued in 1961 by First National City Bank of New York (now \nCitibank); it was designed to compete for corporate cash that companies were investing in Treasury notes \nand other funds. Because CDs are negotiable, they can be traded easily if the holder wants cash, though \ntheir price fluctuates with the market. \n \n \nOther Parties to Commercial Paper \nIn addition to makers, drawees, and payees, there are five other capacities in which one can deal with \ncommercial paper. \n \nIndorser and Indorsee \nThe indorser (also spelled endorser) is one who transfers ownership of a negotiable instrument by \nsigning it. A depositor indorses a check when presenting it for deposit by signing it on the back. The bank \ndeposits its own funds, in the amount of the check, to the depositor’s account. By indorsing it, the \ndepositor transfers ownership of the check to the bank. The depositor’s bank then can present it to the \ndrawer’s bank for repayment from the drawer’s funds. The indorsee is the one to whom a draft or note is \nindorsed. When a check is deposited in a bank, the bank is the indorsee. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n788 \nHolder \nA holder is “a person in possession of a negotiable that is payable either to bearer, or to an identified \nperson that is the person in possession.” [2] Holder is thus a generic term that embraces several of the \nspecific types of parties already mentioned. An indorsee and a drawee can be holders. But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to",

                    "question": "What is the process for a banker's acceptance involving a draft, and what role does the correspondent bank play in this process?",
                    "answer": "The process for a banker's acceptance involving a draft typically starts with a purchase transaction where the bank antes up the purchase amount (less its fees and interest), paying Rackets directly. Subsequently, the bank forwards the draft, bill of lading, and other relevant documents to a correspondent bank located in New York. This correspondent bank then presents these documents to Love’s bank. If the documents are in order, Love’s bank will 'accept' the draft by signing it, turning it into a banker’s acceptance as depicted in Figure 19.3 'A Time Draft'. This signed document is then sent back to the bank in Taiwan. The Taiwanese bank has the option to discount the banker’s acceptance immediately for payment or hold onto it for ninety days to present it to the New York bank for payment. The correspondent bank in New York plays a crucial role by facilitating the transfer of the documents between the banks and ensuring that the draft is presented correctly for acceptance."

                    "question": "How do checks function as a form of commercial paper, and what distinguishes a certified check from a regular check and a cashier’s check?",
                    "answer": "Checks serve as a form of commercial paper under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and are essentially drafts drawn on a bank that are payable on demand. They are usually written on paper forms, but theoretically, they could be written on any medium. A key feature of checks is their flexibility; postdating them (marking a future date) does not change their immediate demand nature, merely setting a future date for payment. A certified check is unique in that it is guaranteed by the drawee bank through certification, which involves stamping the word 'certified' on the face of the check. This certification means the bank guarantees payment when the check is presented, as it has already removed the face amount from the drawer’s account and held it for payment. A certified check differs from a regular check in this critical guarantee. In contrast, a cashier’s check is drawn on the bank’s own account and signed by an authorized representative in exchange for a cash payment from the customer, with the bank guaranteeing the payment of the cashier’s check. Therefore, while both certified checks and cashier’s checks offer a level of security, cashier’s checks are specifically tied to the bank’s own funds rather than the drawer’s funds."

Understand what a transfer of commercial paper is. \n2. Recognize the rights and liabilities of transferees and the liabilities of transferors. \n3. Know how a transfer becomes a negotiation payable to order or to bearer. \n \n \nDefinitions, Rights, and Liabilities \nTransfer means physical delivery of any instrument—negotiable or not—intending to pass title. Section \n3-203(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides that “an instrument is transferred when it is \ndelivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the \nright to enforce the instrument.” \n \nNegotiation and Holder \nSection 3-201(a) of the UCC defines negotiation as “a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or \ninvoluntary, of an instrument to a person who thereby becomes its holder if possession is obtained from a \nperson other than the issuer of the instrument.” A holder is defined in Section 1-201(2) as “a person who \nis in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank” \n(“in blank” means that no indorsement is required for negotiation). The original issuing or making of an \ninstrument is not negotiation, though a holder can be the beneficiary of either a transfer or a negotiation. \nThe Official Comment to 3-201(a) is helpful: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument when the instrument is issued to that person, or the \nstatus of holder can arise as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. “Negotiation” is the \nterm used in article 3 to describe this post-issuance event. Normally, negotiation occurs as the \nresult of a voluntary transfer of possession of an instrument by a holder to another person who \nbecomes the holder as a result of the transfer. Negotiation always requires a change in possession \nof the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n812 \ndirectly or through an agent. But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in \nsome cases the person transferring possession is not a holder.…[S]ubsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession. For example, if an instrument is \npayable to bearer and it is stolen by Thief or is found by Finder, Thief or Finder becomes the",

This means that the holder has physical possession of the instrument and can enforce it against the obligor. A transferee, on the other hand, is someone who receives the instrument through a transfer but is not necessarily the holder. A transfer occurs when the instrument is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. While a transferee may receive the instrument through a transfer, they do not automatically become the holder unless they also have possession of the instrument. The distinction is crucial as the holder has the right to enforce the instrument, whereas a transferee may not have this right unless they also become the holder through possession."

Know the effects of various types of indorsements: no indorsement, partial, blank, special, restrictive, \nconditional, qualified. \n \n \nDefinition and Formal Requirements of Indorsement \nDefinition \nMost commonly, paper is transferred by indorsement. The indorsement is evidence that the indorser \nintended the instrument to move along in the channels of commerce. An indorsement is defined by \nUCC Section 3-204(a) as \n \na signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that alone or accompanied \nby other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating the instrument, (ii) \nrestricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on the instrument, but \nregardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement \nunless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature, or other \ncircumstances unambiguously indicated that the signature was made for a purpose other than \nindorsement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n817 \n \n \nPlacement of Indorsement \nIndorse (or endorse) literally means “on the back of,” as fish, say, have dorsal fins—fins on their backs. \nUsually indorsements are on the back of the instrument, but an indorsement could be on a piece of paper \naffixed to the instrument. Such an attachment is called an allonge—it comes along with the instrument \n(UCC, Section 3-204(a)). \n \nThere are rules about where indorsements are placed. The Expedited Funds Availability Act was enacted \nin 1987 by Congress to standardize holding periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate \ninstitutions’ use of deposit holds—that is, how soon customers can access the money after they have \ndeposited a check in the bank. The Federal Reserve Board subsequently adopted “Regulation CC, Check \nEndorsement Standards” to improve funds availability and expedite the return of checks. See Figure 20.3 \n\"Indorsement Standard\". \n \nFigure 20.3 Indorsement Standard \n \nFrom UC Irvine Administrative Policies & Procedures, Business and Financial Affairs, Financial \nServices, Sec. 704-13: Check Endorsement Procedures, \nathttp://www.policies.uci.edu/adm/procs/700/704-13.html. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n818 \nAs shown in Figure 20.3 \"Indorsement Standard\", specific implementing guidelines define criteria for the \nplacement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank \n(bank of first deposit), subsequent indorsers (paying banks), and corporate or payee indorsers. \nIndorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; \nremaining space is for bank indorsements. There is no penalty for violating the standard—it is a guideline. \nThe abbreviation “MICR” stands for magnetic ink character recognition. The “clear band” is a section of \nthe back of the check that is not supposed to be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) \nprinting that would interfere with machine reading on the front side (the bank routing numbers). \n \nSometimes an indorser adds words intended to strengthen the indorsement; for example, “I hereby assign \nall my right, title, and interest in this note to Carl Carpenter.” Words of assignment such as these and also \nwords of condition, waiver, guaranty, limitation, or disclaimer of liability do not negate the effect of an \nindorsement. \n \nMisspelled or Incorrect Indorsements \nWhen the instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name (or in a name other than his \nown), he may indorse in the wrong name or the right one or both. It is safer to sign in both names, and the \npurchaser of the instrument may demand a signature in both names (UCC, Section 3-204(d)). \n \nVarious Indorsements and Their Effects \nA holder can indorse in a variety of ways; indorsements are not identical and have different effects. \n \nNo Indorsement \nIf the instrument requires a signature, transfer without indorsement is an assignment only.

                    "answer": "According to Regulation CC, indorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; remaining space is for bank indorsements. This regulation defines criteria for the placement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank, subsequent indorsers, and corporate or payee indorsers. Although there is no penalty for violating the standard, it serves as a guideline for proper check handling and processing. The abbreviation ‘MICR’ stands for magnetic ink character recognition, and the ‘clear band’ is a section of the back of the check that should not be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) printing to prevent interference with machine reading on the front side."

Under UCC Section 1-201(43), a forgery is an “unauthorized \nsignature.” Section 3-403(a) provides that any unauthorized signature on an instrument is “ineffective \nexcept as the signature of the unauthorized signer.” The consequence is that, generally, the loss falls on \nthe first party to take the instrument with a forged or unauthorized signature because that person is in the \nbest position to prevent the loss. \n \nLorna Love writes a check to Steve Supplier on her account at First State Bank, but the check goes astray \nand is found by Carl Crooks. Crooks indorses the check “Steve Supplier” and presents it for cash to a busy \nteller who fails to request identification. Two days later, Steve Supplier inquires about his check. Love \ncalls First State Bank to stop payment. Too late—the check has been cashed. Who bears the loss—Love, \nSupplier, or the bank? The bank does, and it must recredit Love’s account. The forged indorsement on the \ncheck was ineffective; the bank was not a holder, and the check should not have been allowed into the \nchannels of commerce. This is why banks may retain checks for a while before allowing access to the \nmoney. It is, in part, what the Expedited Funds Availability Act (mentioned in Section 20.2 \n\"Indorsements\", “Indorsements”) addresses—giving banks time to assess the validity of checks. \n \nExceptions: Imposter, Fictitious Payee, and Dishonest Employee Rules \nThe loss for a forged indorsement usually falls on the first party to take the instrument with a forged \nsignature. However, there are three important exceptions to this general rule: the imposter rule, the \nfictitious payee rule, and the dishonest employee rule. \n \nThe Imposter Rule \nIf one person poses as the named payee or as an agent of the named payee, inducing the maker or drawer \nto issue an instrument in the name of the payee to the imposter (or his confederate), the imposter’s \nindorsement of the payee’s name is effective. The paper can be negotiated according to the \nimposter rule. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n827 \nIf the named payee is a real person or firm, the negotiation of the instrument by the imposter is good and \nhas no effect on whatever obligation the drawer or maker has to the named payee. Lorna Love owes Steve \nSupplier $2,000. Knowing of the debt, Richard Wright writes to Love, pretending to be Steve Supplier, \nrequesting her to send a check to Wright’s address in Supplier’s name. When the check arrives, Wright \nindorses it by signing “Pay to the order of Richard Wright, (signed) Steve Supplier,” and then indorses it \nin his own name and cashes it. Love remains liable to Steve Supplier for the money that she owes him, and \nLove is out the $2,000 unless she can find Wright. \n \nThe difference between this case and the one involving the forger Carl Crooks is that in the second case \nthe imposter (Wright) “induced the maker or drawer [Lorna Love] to issue the instrument…by \nimpersonating the payee of the instrument [Steve Supplier]” (UCC, Section 3-404(a)), whereas in the first \ncase the thief did not induce Love to issue the check to him—he simply found it.

And the rationale for \nmaking Lorna Love bear the loss is that she failed to detect the scam: she intended the imposter, Wright, \nto receive the instrument. Section 3-404(c) provides that the indorsement of the imposter (Wright, posing \nas Steve Supplier) is effective. The same rule applies if the imposter poses as an agent: if the check is \npayable to Supplier, Inc., a company whose president is Steve Supplier, and an impostor impersonates \nSteve Supplier, the check could be negotiated if the imposter indorses it as Supplier, Inc.’s, agent “Steve \nSupplier.”[2] \n \nSimilarly, suppose Love is approached by a young man who says to her, “My company sells tennis balls, \nand we’re offering a special deal this month: a can of three high-quality balls for $2 each. We’ll send your \norder to you by UPS.” He hands her a sample ball: it is substantial, and the price is good. Love has heard \nof the company the man says he represents; she makes out a check for $100 to “Sprocket Athletic Supply.” \nThe young man does not represent the company at all, but he cashes the check by forging the indorsement \nand the bank pays. Love takes the loss: surely she is more to blame than the bank. \n \nThe Fictitious Payee Rule \nSuppose Lorna Love has a bookkeeper, Abby Accountant. Abby presents several checks for Love to sign, \none made out to Carlos Aquino. Perhaps there really is no such person, or perhaps he is somebody whom \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n828 \nLove deals with regularly, but Accountant intends him to have no interest here. No matter: Love signs the \ncheck in the amount of $2,000. Accountant takes the check and indorses it: “Carlos Aquino, pay to the \norder of Abby Accountant.” Then she signs her name as the next indorser and cashes the check at Love’s \nbank. The check is good, even though it was never intended by Accountant that “Carlos Aquino”—\nthe fictitious payee—have any interest in the instrument. The theory here is to “place the loss on the \ndrawer of the check rather than on the drawee or the Depositary Bank that took the check for \ncollection.…The drawer is in the best position to avoid the fraud and thus should take the loss.” [3] This is \nalso known as “the padded-payroll rule.” \n \nIn the imposter cases, Love drew checks made out to real names but gave them to the wrong person (the \nimposter); in the fictitious payee cases she wrote checks to a nonexistent person (or a real person who was \nnot intended to have any interest at all). \nThe Dishonest Employee Rule \nThe UCC takes head-on the recurring problem of a dishonest employee. It says that if an employer \n“entrust[s] an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person \nacting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement \nis effective.” [4] For example (adapted from UCC 3-405, Official Comment 3; the Comment does not use \nthe names of these characters, of course), the duties of Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, include posting \nthe amounts of checks payable to Lorna Love to the accounts of the drawers of the checks. Accountant \nsteals a check payable to Love, which was entrusted to Accountant, and forges Love’s indorsement. The \ncheck is deposited by Accountant to an account in the depositary bank that Accountant opened in the \nsame name as Lorna Love, and the check is honored by the drawee bank. The indorsment is effective as \nLove’s indorsement because Accountant’s duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes. \nThus Accountant is entrusted with “responsibility” with respect to the check. Neither the depositary bank \nnor the drawee bank is liable to Love for conversion of the check. The same result would follow if \nAccountant deposited the check in the account in the depositary bank without indorsement (UCC, Section \n4-205(a)). Under Section 4-205(c), deposit in a depositary bank in an account in a name substantially \nsimilar to that of Lorna Love is the equivalent of an indorsement in the name of Lorna Love. If, say, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n829 \njanitor had stolen the checks, the result would be different, as the janitor is not entrusted with \nresponsibility regarding the instrument. \n \nNegligence \nNot surprisingly, though, if a person fails to exercise ordinary care and thereby substantially contributes",

This means that the drawer, such as Lorna Love, remains liable to the original payee, Steve Supplier, even if the check was given to the wrong person, like Wright, who impersonated Steve Supplier. The rationale behind this rule is that the drawer intended the imposter to receive the instrument, and therefore, the drawer is in the best position to avoid such fraud and should bear the loss. This principle also applies if the imposter poses as an agent, such as when the check is payable to Supplier, Inc., a company whose president is Steve Supplier, and an impostor impersonates Steve Supplier. In such cases, the check could be negotiated if the imposter indorses it as Supplier, Inc.'s agent, 'Steve Supplier.'"

                    "answer": "The UCC addresses the issue of a dishonest employee making a fraudulent endorsement on a check through the 'Dishonest Employee Rule,' which states that if an employer entrusts an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement, the indorsement is effective. For instance, if Abby Accountant, a bookkeeper, steals a check payable to Lorna Love and forges Love's indorsement, the check is still valid as an indorsement from Love because Abby's duties include processing checks for bookkeeping purposes, indicating that she was entrusted with responsibility regarding the check. Consequently, neither the depositary bank nor the drawee bank is liable to Love for the conversion of the check. Similarly, if the employee deposits the check into an account in the same name as the drawer without an indorsement, the result remains the same under Section 4-205(a) of the UCC. However, if a non-employee, like the janitor, steals the check, the result would differ, as the janitor is not entrusted with responsibility regarding the instrument. Additionally, under Section 4-205(c) of the UCC, depositing a check in a depositary bank in an account with a name substantially similar to the drawer's name is considered equivalent to an indorsement in the drawer's name."

At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

This suggests that the holder of a check can, in certain circumstances, override restrictive conditions attached to the instrument through their own actions, such as depositing the check directly into their account. This ability to waive restrictive conditions highlights the flexibility in handling negotiable instruments but also underscores the importance of clear and unambiguous language in the indorsement to prevent misunderstandings or disputes."

First, the owner might require the employee to provide a specific indorsement or signature that is unique to the individual. Alternatively, the owner could establish a policy that requires employees to present a form of identification when cashing checks.

In any event, typically the HDC is not the payee of the instrument, but rather, is an \nimmediate or remote transferee of the payee. \n \nThe Shelter Rule \nThere is one last point to mention before we get to the real nub of the holder-in-due-course concept (that \nthe sins of her predecessors are washed away for an HDC). The shelter rule provides that the transferee \nof an instrument acquires the same rights that the transferor had. Thus a person who does not himself \nqualify as an HDC can still acquire that status if some previous holder (someone “upstream”) was an \nHDC. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n860 \nOn June 1, Clifford sells Harold the original manuscript of Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography. Unknown \nto Harold, however, the manuscript is a forgery. Harold signs a promissory note payable to Clifford for \n$250,000 on August 1. Clifford negotiates the note to Betsy on July 1 for $200,000; she is unaware of the \nfraud. On August 2, Betsy gives the note to Al as a token of her affection. Al is Clifford’s friend and knows \nabout the scam (see Figure 21.1 \"The Shelter Rule\"). May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument. A payee may be an HDC but usually would not be (because \nhe would know of problems with it). The shelter rule says that a transferee of an instrument acquires the \nsame rights her transferor had, so a person can have the rights of an HDC without satisfying the requirements \nof an HDC (provided she does not engage in any fraud or illegality related to the transaction). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "The holder-in-due-course (HDC) status is significant in commercial transactions because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take the paper free from most claims and defenses against it. This means that a holder in due course can buy and sell negotiable instruments without worrying about potential issues with the instrument's history, as long as they meet certain criteria. Specifically, an HDC must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously irregular, take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable person would recognize as tainting the instrument. By providing this level of protection, the HDC status makes the paper almost as readily transferable as cash, promoting a free and efficient market for commercial paper. However, it's important to note that an HDC cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument."

In support of his summary judgment motion, plaintiff submitted an affidavit from each \ncompany; each company swore that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any \nclaims or defenses by any party, without knowledge that any of the signatures on the checks were \nunauthorized or fraudulent, and with the expectation that the checks would be paid upon their \npresentment to the bank upon which the checks were drawn. Hauser Co. does not dispute any of the facts \nsworn to by the check cashing companies. \n \nThe checks were then transferred to plaintiff in accordance with section 3-303, vesting plaintiff with \nholder in due course status. Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff. Plaintiff thus acquired the check cashing companies’ holder in due \ncourse status when the checks were assigned to plaintiff. Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized. Presumably, this argument is predicated on section 3-302. This section states a person is \nnot a holder in due course if the instrument bears “apparent evidence of forgery or alteration” or is \notherwise “so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.” \n \nIn order to preclude liability from a holder in due course under section 3-302, it must be apparent on the \nface of the instrument that it is fraudulent. The trial court specifically found that Hauser Co. had provided \nno such evidence, stating that Hauser Co. had failed to show that there was anything about the \nappearance of the checks to place the check cashing company on notice that any check was not valid. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n881 \nSpecifically, with respect to Hauser Co.’s facsimile signature on the checks, the court stated that the \nsignature was identical to Hauser Co.’s authorized facsimile signature. Moreover, each of the check \ncashing companies certified that they had no knowledge that the signatures on the checks were fraudulent \nor that there were any claims or defenses to enforcement of the checks. Hence, the trial court’s conclusion \nthat there was no apparent evidence of invalidity was not an abuse of discretion and was based on a \nreasonable reading of the record. \n \nTo be sure, section 3-308(a) does shift the burden of establishing the validity of the signature to the \nplaintiff, but only if the defendant specifically denies the signature’s validity in the pleadings. The section \nstates: \n \nIn an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each \nsignature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity \nof a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person \nclaiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action \nis to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time \nof trial of the issue of validity of the signature.",

Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with \nthird parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

[4]If the \ndrawee accepts the draft, the same rules apply. \n3. The presenter has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer is unauthorized. If the presenter \ndoesn’t know Drawer’s signature is forged and the drawee pays out on a forged signature, the drawee \nbears the loss. (The bank would be liable for paying out over the forged drawer’s signature: that’s why \nit has the customer’s signature on file.) \n \nThese rules apply—again—to warranties made by the presenter to a drawee paying out on an unaccepted \ndraft. The most common situation would be where a person has a check made out to her and she gets it \ncashed at the drawer’s bank. \n \n \nWarranties Made by One Who Presents Something Other Than an Unaccepted Draft \nIn all other cases, there is only one warranty made by the presenter: that he or she is a person entitled to \nenforce the instrument or obtain payment on it. \n \nThis applies to the presentment of accepted drafts, to the presentment of dishonored drafts made to the \ndrawer or an indorser, and to the presentment of notes. For example, Maker makes a note payable to \nPayee; Payee indorses the note to Indorsee, Indorsee indorses and negotiates the note to Subsequent \nParty. Subsequent Party presents the note to Maker for payment. The Subsequent Party warrants to \nMaker that she is entitled to obtain payment. If she is paid and is not entitled to payment, Maker can sue \nher for breach of that warranty. If the reason she isn’t entitled to payment is because Payee’s signature \nwas forged by Thief, then Maker can go after Thief: the UCC says that “the person obtaining payment \n[Subsequent Party] and a prior transferor [Thief] warrant to the person making payment in good faith \n[Maker] that the warrantor [Subsequent Party] is entitled to enforce the instrument.” [5] Or, again, Drawer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n905 \nmakes the check out to Payee; Payee attempts to cash or deposit the check, but it is dishonored. Payee \npresents the check to Drawer to make it good: Payee warrants he is entitled to payment on it. \n \nWarranties cannot be disclaimed in the case of checks (because, as UCC Section 3-417, Comment 7, puts \nit, “it is not appropriate to allow disclaimer of warranties appearing on checks that normally will not be \nexamined by the payor bank”—they’re machine read). But a disclaimer of warranties is permitted as to \nother instruments, just as disclaimers of warranty are usually OK under general contract law. The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it",

                    "answer": "When presenting an unaccepted draft, the presenter makes three main warranties: first, the presenter is entitled to enforce the draft or obtain payment or acceptance, which means there are no unauthorized or missing endorsements. This protects the payor from having to honor a fraudulent or unauthorized draft. Second, there has been no alteration of the instrument, meaning the payor is protected from having to pay an altered draft. Third, the presenter has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer is unauthorized, ensuring the payor does not have to bear the risk of paying a forged signature. These warranties are crucial as they prevent the payor from being held responsible for fraudulent activities and ensure the integrity of the presented instrument."

                    "answer": "Presentment warranties differ significantly between those made by someone presenting an unaccepted draft and those made by someone presenting something else. For unaccepted drafts, there are three main warranties: the presenter is entitled to enforce the draft, there has been no alteration of the instrument, and the presenter has no knowledge that the drawer's signature is unauthorized. These warranties ensure the payor is protected from fraudulent or unauthorized actions. On the other hand, for presentations of other instruments (like accepted drafts, dishonored drafts, or notes), there is only one warranty: the presenter is a person entitled to enforce the instrument or obtain payment on it. This single warranty is less specific and focuses solely on the presenter's entitlement to the instrument. The legal implications of these differences lie in the scope of protection provided to the payor and the complexity of potential disputes. For instance, in the case of unaccepted drafts, the payor has more comprehensive protection against various forms of fraud and unauthorized actions, whereas in the case of other instruments, the payor must rely on the presenter's claim of entitlement to the instrument."

But Bank insists that an accommodation \nparty also become liable to pay the note (by signing it as a co-maker or by indorsing the note). In \nsuretyship law, the accommodation party is a “Surety.” Then Bank agrees to a modification of the \nrights and obligations between it and Principal Debtor, such as agreeing that she may pay the \nnote at some date after the due date, or that she may discharge her $10,000 obligation to pay the \nnote by paying Bank $3,000, or the Bank releases collateral she gave it to secure the note. Surety \nis discharged if changes like this are made by Bank (the creditor) without Surety’s consent to the \nextent Surety suffers loss as a result. Section 3-605 is concerned with this kind of problem with \nPrincipal Debtor and Surety. But it has a wider scope: it also applies to indorsers who are not \naccommodation parties. Unless an indorser signs without recourse, the indorser’s liability under \nsection 3-415(a) is that of a surety. If Bank in our hypothetical case indorsed the note and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n911 \ntransferred it to Second Bank, Bank has rights given to an indorser under section 3-605 if it is \nSecond Bank that modifies rights and obligations of Borrower. \n \nDischarge by Reacquisition \nSuppose a prior party reacquires the instrument. He may—but does not automatically—cancel any \nindorsement unnecessary to his title and may also reissue or further negotiate the instrument. Any \nintervening party is thereby discharged from liability to the reacquiring party or to any subsequent holder \nnot in due course. If an intervening party’s indorsement is cancelled, she is not liable even to an HDC. [5] \nDischarge by Unexcused Delay in Presentment or Notice of Dishonor \nIf notice of dishonor is not excused under UCC Section 3-504, failure to give it discharges drawers and \nindorsers. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe potential liabilities arising from commercial paper are discharged in several ways. Anything that would \ndischarge a debt under common contract law will do so. More specifically as to commercial paper, of course, \npayment discharges the obligation. Other methods include tender of payment, cancellation or renunciation, \nmaterial and fraudulent alteration, certification, acceptance varying a draft, reacquisition, and—in some \ncases—unexcused delay in giving notice of presentment or dishonor. Indorsers and accommodation parties’ \nliability may be discharged by the same means that a surety’s liability is discharged, to the extent that \nalterations in the agreement between the creditor and the holder would be defenses to a surety because right \nof recourse is impaired to the surety. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

We \nfind that it did, and affirm. \n \nFacts \nMichael and Stacy Russell owned a mobile home in Harrah, Oklahoma.

Conseco had a mortgage security interest in the home. \nIn August 2002, a fire completely destroyed the mobile home. The Russells submitted an insurance claim \nto Farm Bureau. Farm Bureau then negotiated a $69,000 settlement with the Russells, issued them a \ncheck in this amount payable to them and Conseco jointly, and mailed the check to the Russells. Neither \nthe Russells nor Farm Bureau notified Conseco of the loss, the settlement, or the mailing of the check. \n \nThe check was drawn on Farm Bureau’s account at BNH. The Russells deposited the check into their \naccount at BOK. The check contains an endorsement by both Russells, and a rubber stamp endorsement \nfor Conseco followed by a signature of a Donna Marlatt and a phone number. It is undisputed that \nConseco’s endorsement was forged. Upon receipt, BOK presented the check to BNH. BNH paid the \n$69,000 check and notified Farm Bureau that the check had been paid from its account. \n \nAbout a year later, Conseco learned about the fire and the insurance payoff. Conseco notified Farm \nBureau that it was owed a mortgage balance of more than $50,000. Farm Bureau paid off the balance and \nnotified BNH of the forgery. BNH reimbursed Farm Bureau the amount paid to Conseco. BNH then sued \nBOK. \n \nBoth banks relied on the Uniform Commercial Code. BNH asserted that under § 4-208, BOK had \nwarranted that all the indorsements on the check were genuine. BOK asserted an affirmative defense \nunder § 3-406, alleging that Farm Bureau’s own negligence contributed to the forgery. After a non-jury \ntrial, the court granted judgment to BOK, finding as follows: \n \n• \nConseco’s endorsement was a forgery, accomplished by the Russells; \n• \nFarm Bureau was negligent in the manner and method it used to process the claim and pay the \nsettlement without providing any notice or opportunity for involvement in the process to \nConseco; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n914 \n• \nFarm Bureau’s negligence substantially contributed to the Russells’ conduct in forging Conseco’s \nendorsement; and \n• \nBOK proved its affirmative defense under § 3-406 by the greater weight of the evidence. \n \nFrom this judgment, BNH appeals. \n \nAnalysis \nIt cannot be disputed that BOK breached its presentment warranty to BNH under § 4-208. [1] Thus the \nprimary issue raised is whether BOK established a preclusion defense under 3-406 [that BNH is \nprecluded from complaining about BOK’s breach of presentment warranty because of its own \nnegligence]. [2] BNH asserts that the evidence fails to establish this defense because the mailing of its \ncheck to and receipt by the insured “is at most an event of opportunity and has nothing to do with the \nactual forgery.” \n \nSection 3-406 requires less stringent proof than the “direct and proximate cause” test for general \nnegligence. [3] Conduct is a contributing cause of an alteration or forgery if it is a substantial factor in \nbringing it about, or makes it “easier for the wrongdoer to commit his wrong.” The UCC Comment to § 3-\n406 notes that the term has the meaning as used by the Pennsylvania court in Thompson [Citation]. \n \nIn Thompson, an independent logger named Albers obtained blank weighing slips, filled them out to show \nfictitious deliveries of logs for local timber owners, delivered the slips to the company, accepted checks \nmade payable to the timber owners, forged the owners’ signatures, and cashed the checks at the bank. \nWhen the company discovered the scheme, it sued the bank and the bank raised § 3-406 as a defense. The \ncourt specifically found that the company’s negligence did not have to be the direct and proximate cause \nof the bank’s acceptance of the forged checks. Instead, the defense applied because the company left blank \nlogging slips readily accessible to haulers, the company had given Albers whole pads of blank slips, the \nslips were not consecutively numbered, haulers were allowed to deliver both the original and duplicate",

The teller, by use of a computer, confirmed the availability of \nfunds on deposit, and placed the check into the computer’s printer slot. The computer stamped certain \ndata on the back of the check, including the time, date, amount of the check, account number, and teller \nnumber. The computer also effected a hold on the amount of $976.00 in the customer’s account. The \nteller gave the check back to the Petitioner, who endorsed it. The teller then asked for Petitioner’s \nidentification. Petitioner presented his driver’s license and a major credit card. The teller took the \nindorsed check from Petitioner and manually inscribed the driver’s license information and certain credit \ncard information on the back of the check. \n \nAt some point during the transaction, the teller counted out $976.00 in cash from her drawer in \nanticipation of completing the transaction. She asked if the Petitioner was a customer of Bank of America. \nThe Petitioner stated that he was not. The teller returned the check to Petitioner and requested, consistent \nwith bank policy when cashing checks for non-customers, that Petitioner place his thumbprint on the \ncheck. [The thumbprint identification program was designed by various banking and federal agencies to \nreduce check fraud.] Petitioner refused and the teller informed him that she would be unable to complete \nthe transaction without his thumbprint. \n \n…Petitioner presented the check to the branch manager and demanded that the check be cashed \nnotwithstanding Petitioner’s refusal to place his thumbprint on the check.

Additionally, the Bank might have used § 3-401(b) to argue that for a signature to constitute acceptance, it must be a signature of the person making the acceptance, and in this case, it was the computer rather than a human agent of the bank.

Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault. [Citation] Martin, in any event, fails to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n928 \nsupport Friedman’s and Jennewein’s statements with firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits, so the \nstatements do not qualify as competent evidence. [Citation] \n \nMartin claims that the risk of loss falls on the bank. But the cases Martin cites in support of that \nproposition suffer from two defects. First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930]. The one modern case that Martin cites is also inapposite because the case involves a \ndrawer and a drawee bank. [Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card.

Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement. The check was returned to PNC unpaid. PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract \nclaim by arguing that PNC made a mistake. The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement. [Citation] Good faith, under both theories, means honesty in \nfact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. That means “contracts impose \non the parties thereto a duty to do everything necessary to carry them out.” [Citation] \n \nThe undisputed evidence establishes that PNC acted in good faith. PNC accepted deposit of Martin’s \ncheck, attempted to present the check for payment at First Century Bank, and charged back Martin’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n930 \naccount when the check was dishonored. Martin cannot claim that PNC lacked good faith and fair dealing \nwhen PNC took actions permitted under the contract. [Citation] Although PNC might have had the ability \nto investigate the authenticity of the check before crediting Martin’s account, PNC bore no such obligation \nbecause Martin warranted that the check was authentic. [UCC] § 3-416(a). Friedman’s and Jennewein’s \nstatements do not impute a lack of good faith to PNC, even if Martin could support the statements with \ncompetent evidence. The Uniform Commercial Code and the account agreement place the risk of loss on \nMartin, even if PNC made a mistake. \n \nMartin suggests that an insurance carrier might have already reimbursed PNC for the loss. Martin, \nhowever, presents no evidence of reimbursement, which PNC, presumably, would have disclosed in \ndiscovery. \n \nPNC, therefore, may recover from Martin the overdraft value of $124,313.01, which is the loss PNC \nsuffered as a result of Martin’s breach of the transfer warranties and breach of contract. [UCC] § 3-\n416(b)… \n \nIII.

Specifically, the check was deposited into Martin's account, and when the bank (First Century Bank) dishonored the check, PNC, acting on behalf of Martin's account, attempted to charge back the amount from Martin's account. Since the check was returned unpaid, PNC charged Martin's account, leading to an overdraft. This action was supported by the terms of Martin's account agreement, which allowed PNC to charge back the account for any item returned unpaid. The court held that Martin was liable for this amount under the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim and the breach-of-contract claim, as detailed in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 3-416(b) and the account agreement terms."

This section states that a bank can recover from the depositor the amount of any item returned unpaid, including the cost of any collection efforts. In this case, the court interpreted this provision to mean that PNC could charge back Martin's account for the value of the returned check, leading to the overdraft. The provision requires that the bank act in good faith, meaning they must honestly adhere to reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing, but PNC was deemed to have acted in good faith by attempting to present the check for payment and charging back the account when the check was dishonored."

Under the UCC, a purchaser in good faith and for value is protected from subsequent claims by third parties, including forgeries. Therefore, if Archer genuinely believed the signature was authentic and acted in good faith, he would not be held liable. Additionally, Chase must ensure that proper notice of dishonor was given to Archer, as this is a prerequisite for holding secondary parties like Archer responsible. If Archer did not have actual knowledge of the forgery and acted in good faith, his liability would be limited, and Chase might struggle to hold him accountable despite the forgery."

The act provides certain warranties to protect \nrecipients of substitute checks that are intended to protect recipients against losses associated with the \ncheck substitution process. One of these warranties provides that “[a] bank that transfers, presents, or \nreturns a substitute check…for which it receives consideration warrants…that…[t]he substitute check \nmeets the requirements of legal equivalence” (12 CFR § 229.52(a)(1)). The Check 21 Act does not replace \nexisting state laws regarding such instruments. The Uniform Commercial Code still applies, and we turn \nto it next. \n \nTwo notable consequences of the Check 21 Act are worth mentioning. The first is that a check may be \npresented to the payor bank for payment very quickly, perhaps in less than an hour: the customer’s “float” \ntime is abbreviated. That means be sure you have enough money in your account to cover the checks that \nyou write. The second consequence of Check 21 Act is that it is now possible for anybody—you at home or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n944 \nthe merchant from whom you are buying something—to scan a check and deposit it instantly. “Remote \ndeposit capture” allows users to transmit a scanned image of a check for posting and clearing using a web-\nconnected computer and a check scanner. The user clicks to send the deposit to the desired existing bank \naccount. Many merchants are using this system: that’s why if you write a check at the hardware store you \nmay see it scanned and returned immediately to you. The digital data are transmitted, and the scanned \nimage may be retrieved, if needed, as a “substitute check.” \n \nUCC Article 4: Aspects of Bank Operations \nReason for Article 4 \nOver the years, the states had begun to enact different statutes to regulate the check collection process. \nEighteen states adopted the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code; many others enacted \nDeferred Posting statutes. Not surprisingly, a desire for uniformity was the principal reason for the \nadoption of UCC Article 4. Article 4 absorbed many of the rules of the American Bankers Association Code \nand of the principles of the Deferred Posting statutes, as well as court decisions and common customs not \npreviously codified. \n \nBanks Covered \nArticle 4 covers three types of banks: depository banks, payor banks, and collecting banks. These terms—\nalready mentioned earlier—are defined in UCC Section 4-105. A depositary bank is the first bank to which \nan item is transferred for collection. Section 4-104 defines “item” as “an instrument or a promise or order \nto pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment[,]…not including a credit or debit card slip.” A \npayor bank is any bank that must pay a check because it is drawn on the bank or accepted there—the \ndrawee bank (a depositary bank may also be a payor bank). A collecting bank is any bank except the payor \nbank that handles the item for collection. \n \nTechnical Rules \nDetailed coverage of Parts 2 and 3 of Article 4, the substantive provisions, is beyond the scope of this \nbook. However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2. May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.”",

In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and \nSupplies Ltd. is still the beneficiary.

The usual practice is for banks and their \ncustomers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders. If a bank establishes a \ncommercially reasonable procedure, complies with that procedure, and acts in good faith and according to \nits agreement with the customer, the customer is bound by an unauthorized payment order. There is, \nhowever, an important exception to this rule. A customer will not be liable when the order is from a \nperson unrelated to its business operations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n960 \nError by Sender \nSecond, who is responsible when the sender makes a mistake—for instance, in instructing payment \ngreater than what was intended? The general rule is that the sender is bound by its own error. But in cases \nwhere the error would have been discovered had the bank complied with its security procedure, the \nreceiving bank is liable for the excess over the amount intended by the sender, although the bank is \nallowed to recover this amount from the beneficiary. \n \nBank Mistake in Transferring Funds \nThird, what are the consequences when the bank makes a mistake in transferring funds? Suppose, for \nexample, that Widgets (in the previous situation) instructed payment of $2 million but First Bank in turn \ninstructed payment of $20 million. First Bank would be entitled to only $2 million from Widgets and \nwould then attempt to recover the remaining $18 million from Supplies Ltd. If First Bank had instructed \npayment to the wrong beneficiary, Widgets would have no liability and the bank would be responsible for \nrecovering the entire payment. Unless the parties agree otherwise, however, a bank that improperly \nexecutes a payment order is not liable for consequential damages. \n \nLetters of Credit \nBecause international trade involves risks not usually encountered in domestic trade—government control \nof exports, imports, and currency; problems in verifying goods’ quality and quantity; disruptions caused \nby adverse weather, war; and so on—merchants have over the years devised means to minimize these \nrisks, most notably the letter of credit (“LC”). Here are discussed the definition of letters of credit, the \nsource of law governing them, how they work as payments for exports and as payments for imports. \n \nDefinition \nA letter of credit is a statement by a bank (or other financial institution) that it will pay a specified sum \nof money to specific persons if certain conditions are met. Or, to rephrase, it is a letter issued by a bank \nauthorizing the bearer to draw a stated amount of money from the issuing bank (or its branches, or other \nassociated banks or agencies). Originally, a letter of credit was quite literally that—a letter addressed by \nthe buyer’s bank to the seller’s bank stating that the former could vouch for their good customer, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n961 \nbuyer, and that it would pay the seller in case of the buyer’s default. An LC is issued by a bank on behalf of \nits creditworthy customers, whose application for the credit has been approved by that bank. \n \nSource of Law \nLetters of credit are governed by both international and US domestic law. \n \nInternational Law \nMany countries (including the United States) have bodies of law governing letters of credit. Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce.

However, a customer will not be liable when the order is from a person unrelated to its business operations. When the sender makes a mistake, such as instructing a payment greater than what was intended, the general rule is that the sender is bound by its own error. But if the error would have been discovered had the bank complied with its security procedure, the receiving bank is liable for the excess over the amount intended by the sender, though the bank can recover this amount from the beneficiary. Lastly, when a bank makes a mistake in transferring funds, such as paying more than instructed, the bank would be entitled to the correct amount from the sender and would attempt to recover the excess from the beneficiary. Unless the parties agree otherwise, a bank that improperly executes a payment order is not liable for consequential damages."

Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce. Suppose the parties do not stipulate a body of law for the agreement, and the \nvarious bodies of law conflict, what then?

She does so by “opening” a letter of credit at her bank—the issuing bank—the \nBanque de Rue de Houdini where she has funds in her account, or good credit. She tells the bank the \nterms of sale, the nature and quantity of the goods, the amount to be paid, the documents she will require \nas proof of shipment, and an expiration date. Banque de Rue de Houdini then directs its correspondent \nbank in the United States, First Excelsior Bank, to inform Julius that the letter of credit has been opened: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n963 \nRochelle is good for it. For Julius to have the strongest guarantee that he will be paid, Banque de Rou de \nHoudini can ask First Excelsior to confirm the letter of credit, thus binding both Banque de Rue de \nHoudini and Excelsior to pay according to the terms of the letter. \n \nOnce Julius is informed that the letter of credit has been issued and confirmed, he can proceed to ship the \ngoods and draw a draft to present (along with the required documents such as commercial invoice, bill of \nlading, and insurance policy) to First Excelsior, which is bound to follow exactly its instructions from \nBanque de Rue de Houdini. Julius can present the draft and documents directly, through correspondent \nbanks, or by a representative at the port from which he is shipping the goods. On presentation, First \nExcelsior may forward the documents to Banque de Rue de Houdini for approval and when First Excelsior \nis satisfied it will take the draft and pay Julius immediately on a sight draft or will stamp the draft \n“accepted” if it is a time draft (payable in thirty, sixty, or ninety days).

In 2001, Meade entered into an agreement \nwith the Adams County Lumber Company to purchase a yard barn for $2,784 and paid half the cost as a \ndeposit. On the date of delivery, Friday, March 9, 2001, Meade issued a check to the Lumber Company for \nthe remaining amount he owed on the barn, $1,406.79. \n \nMeade was not satisfied with the barn. Therefore, at 5:55 p.m. on March 9, 2001, Meade called the Bank \nto place a stop payment order on his check. Jacqueline Evans took the stop payment order from Meade. \nShe received all the information and authorization needed to stop payment on the check at that time. \n \nBank employees are supposed to enter stop payments into the computer immediately after taking them. \nHowever, Evans did not immediately enter the stop payment order into the computer because it was 6:00 \np.m. on Friday, and the Bank closes at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays. Furthermore, the Bank’s policy provides that \nany matters that are received after 2:00 p.m. on a Friday are treated as being received on the next \nbusiness day, which was Monday, March 12, 2001 in this instance. \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 10, 2001, Greg Scott, an officer of the Lumber Company, presented \nthe check in question for payment at the Bank. The Bank paid the check. On Monday, the Bank entered \nMeade’s stop payment into the computer and charged Meade a $15 stop payment fee. Upon realizing that \nit already paid the check, on Tuesday the Bank credited the $15 stop payment fee back to Meade’s \naccount. On Thursday, the Bank deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade’s account. \n \nIn the meanwhile, Meade contacted Greg Scott at the Lumber Company regarding his dissatisfaction with \nthe barn. Scott sent workers to repair the barn on Saturday, March 10 and on Monday, March 12. \nHowever, Meade still was not satisfied. In particular, he was unhappy with the runners supporting the \nbarn. Although his order with the Lumber Company specifically provided for 4 x 6” runner boards, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n966 \nLumber Company used 2 x 6” boards. The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn. Baker charged Meade approximately three hundred dollars to make \nthe necessary repairs. Baker testified that properly laminated two by six-inch boards are just as strong as \nfour by six-inch boards. \n \nMeade filed suit against the Bank in the trial court seeking $5,000 in damages.

Since the letter of credit is irrevocable, the bank is obligated to pay the draft upon presentation of proper documentation, irrespective of any issues with the goods. To mitigate the risk of non-payment, banks have several strategies. One such strategy is issuing a trust receipt, under which the goods are handed over to the importer before payment, but the importer acts as a trustee for the bank and must hold the proceeds for the bank until the full amount is repaid."

This delay allowed the check to be presented for payment on Saturday, leading the bank to pay the check despite the stop payment order. The bank later corrected the mistake by entering the stop payment and refunding Meade the $15 stop payment fee, but it also deducted the amount of the check, $1,406.79, from Meade's account. Additionally, Meade suffered $3,800 in damages due to the barn's poor quality and the subsequent repairs made by him and a carpenter, which the bank had to address as a consequence of its error."

Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business.

The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are \nvalued at $25,000 or less and the lease is for four months or more. All material terms of the lease must be \ndisclosed in writing. \n \nFair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n991 \nIn 1989, the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act went into effect. This amends the TILA by \nrequiring credit card issuers to disclose in a uniform manner the annual percentage rate, annual fees, \ngrace period, and other information on credit card applications. \n \nCredit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 \nThe 1989 act did make it possible for consumers to know the costs associated with credit card use, but the \ncard companies’ behavior over 20 years convinced Congress that more regulation was required. In 2009, \nCongress passed and President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act). It is a further amendment of the TILA. Some of the salient \nparts of the act are as follows: \n \n• \nRestricts all interest rate increases during the first year, with some exceptions. The purpose is to \nabolish “teaser” rates. \n• \nIncreases notice for rate increase on future purchases to 45 days. \n• \nPreserves the ability to pay off on the old terms, with some exceptions. \n• \nLimits fees and penalty interest and requires statements to clearly state the required due date and \nlate payment penalty. \n• \nRequires fair application of payments. Amounts in excess of the minimum payment must be \napplied to the highest interest rate (with some exceptions). \n• \nProvides sensible due dates and time to pay. \n• \nProtects young consumers. Before issuing a card to a person under the age of twenty-one, the card \nissuer must obtain an application that contains either the signature of a cosigner over the age of \ntwenty-one or information indicating an independent means of repaying any credit extended. \n• \nRestricts card issuers from providing tangible gifts to students on college campuses in exchange \nfor filling out a credit card application. \n• \nRequires colleges to publicly disclose any marketing contracts made with a card issuer. \n• \nRequires enhanced disclosures. \n• \nRequires issuers to disclose the period of time and the total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if only minimum monthly payments are made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n992 \n• \nEstablishes gift card protections. [1] \n \nThe Federal Reserve Board is to issue implementing rules. \n \nCreditors who violate the TILA are subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. Of these, the most \nimportant are the civil remedies open to consumers. If a creditor fails to disclose the required \ninformation, a customer may sue to recover twice the finance charge, plus court costs and reasonable \nattorneys’ fees, with some limitations. As to the Credit Card Act of 2009, the issuing companies were not \nhappy with the reforms. Before the law went into effect, the companies—as one commentator put it—\nunleashed a “frenzy of retaliation,” [2]by repricing customer accounts, changing fixed rates to variable \nrates, lowering credit limits, and increasing fees. \n \nState Credit Disclosure Laws \nThe federal TILA is not the only statute dealing with credit disclosures. A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated",

Banks told single women to find a cosigner for loans. Divorced women discovered that \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n993 \nthey could not open store charge accounts because they lacked a prior credit history, even though they had \ncontributed to the family income on which previous accounts had been based. Married couples found that \nthe wife’s earnings were not counted when they sought credit; indeed, families planning to buy homes \nwere occasionally even told that the bank would grant a mortgage if the wife would submit to a \nhysterectomy! In all these cases, the premise of the refusal to treat women equally was the unstated—and \nusually false—belief that women would quit work to have children or simply to stay home. \n \nBy the 1970s, as women became a major factor in the labor force, Congress reacted to the manifest \nunfairness of the discrimination by enacting (as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act) the Equal \nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) of 1974. The act prohibits any creditor from discriminating “against any \napplicant on the basis of sex or marital status with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.” In 1976, \nCongress broadened the law to bar discrimination (1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, \nand age; (2) because all or a part of an applicant’s income is from a public assistance program; or (3) \nbecause an applicant has exercised his or her rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. \n \nUnder the ECOA, a creditor may not ask a credit applicant to state sex, race, national origin, or religion. \nAnd unless the applicant is seeking a joint loan or account or lives in a community-property state, the \ncreditor may not ask for a statement of marital status or, if you have voluntarily disclosed that you are \nmarried, for information about your spouse, nor may one spouse be required to cosign if the other is \ndeemed independently creditworthy. All questions concerning plans for children are improper. In \nassessing the creditworthiness of an applicant, the creditor must consider all sources of income, including \nregularly received alimony and child support payments. And if credit is refused, the creditor must, on \ndemand, tell you the specific reasons for rejection. See Rosa v. Park West Bank & Trust Co. in Section \n24.3 \"Cases\" for a case involving the ECOA. \n \nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 1975, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), 1977, get at \nanother type of discrimination: redlining. This is the practice by a financial institution of refusing to grant \nhome loans or home-improvement loans to people living in low-income neighborhoods. The act requires \nthat financial institutions within its purview report annually by transmitting information from their Loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n994 \nApplication Registers to a federal agency. From these reports it is possible to determine what is happening \nto home prices in a particular area, whether investment in one neighborhood lags compared with that in \nothers, if the racial or economic composition of borrowers changed over time, whether minorities or \nwomen had trouble accessing mortgage credit, in what kinds of neighborhoods subprime loans are \nconcentrated, and what types of borrowers are most likely to receive subprime loans, among others. \n“Armed with hard facts, users of all types can better execute their work: Advocates can launch consumer \neducation campaigns in neighborhoods being targeted by subprime lenders, planners can better tailor \nhousing policy to market conditions, affordable housing developers can identify gentrifying \nneighborhoods, and activists can confront banks with poor lending records in low income \ncommunities.” [4] Under the CRA, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA \ncompliance and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank \nbranches or for mergers or acquisitions. \n \nFair Credit Reporting Act of 1970: Checking the Applicant’s Credit Record \nIt is in the interests of all consumers that people who would be bad credit risks not get credit: if they do \nand they default (fail to pay their debts), the rest of us end up paying for their improvidence.

Recognize, most generally, the two methods by which debtors’ obligations may be secured. \n2. Know the source of law for personal property security. \n3.

Understand how the security interest is created—”attached”—and perfected. \n \n \n \nThe Problem of Security \nCreditors want assurances that they will be repaid by the debtor. An oral promise to pay is no security at \nall, and—as it is oral—it is difficult to prove. A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate.",

[16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse \nreceipt—is embodied in a written paper, the paper itself is indispensable for the transferee to access the \nvalue. For example, suppose Deborah Debtor borrows $3,000 from Carl Creditor, and Carl takes a \nsecurity interest in four designer chairs Deborah owns that are being stored in a warehouse. If Deborah \ndefaults, Carl has the right to possession of the warehouse receipt: he takes it to the warehouser and is \nentitled to take the chairs and sell them to satisfy the obligation. The warehouser will not let Carl have the \nchairs without the warehouse receipt—it’s indispensable paper. There are four kinds of indispensable \npaper. \n \nChattel Paper \nChattel is another word for goods. Chattel paper is a record (paper or electronic) that demonstrates both \n“a monetary obligation and a security interest either in certain goods or in a lease on certain \ngoods.” [17] The paper represents a valuable asset and can itself be used as collateral. For example, Creditor \nCar Company sells David Debtor an automobile and takes back a note and security agreement (this is a \npurchase-money security agreement; the note and security agreement is chattel paper). The chattel paper \nis not yet collateral; the automobile is. Now, though, Creditor Car Company buys a new hydraulic lift from \nLift Co., and grants Lift Co. a security interest in Debtor’s chattel paper to secure Creditor Car’s debt to \nLift Co. The chattel paper is now collateral. Chattel paper can be tangible (actual paper) or electronic. \n \nDocuments \nThis category includes documents of title—bills of lading and warehouse receipts are examples. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1027 \n \nInstruments \nAn “instrument” here is “a negotiable instrument (checks, drafts, notes, certificates of deposit) or any \nother writing that evidences a right to the payment of a monetary obligation, is not itself a security \nagreement or lease, and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with \nany necessary indorsement or assignment.” “Instrument” does not include (i) investment property, (ii) \nletters of credit, or (iii) writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or \ncharge card or information contained on or for use with the card. [18] \n \nInvestment Property \nThis includes securities (stock, bonds), security accounts, commodity accounts, and commodity \ncontracts. [19] Securities may be certified (represented by a certificate) or uncertified (not represented by a \ncertificate).[20] \n \nOther Types of Collateral \nAmong possible other types of collateral that may be used as security is the floating lien. This is a \nsecurity interest in property that was not in the possession of the debtor when the security agreement was \nexecuted. The floating lien creates an interest that floats on the river of present and future collateral and \nproceeds held by—most often—the business debtor. It is especially useful in loans to businesses that sell \ntheir collateralized inventory. Without the floating lien, the lender would find its collateral steadily \ndepleted as the borrowing business sells its products to its customers. Pretty soon, there’d be no security \nat all. The floating lien includes the following: \n• \nAfter-acquired property. This is property that the debtor acquires after the original deal was set \nup. It allows the secured party to enhance his security as the debtor (obligor) acquires more \nproperty subject to collateralization. \n• \nSale proceeds. These are proceeds from the disposition of the collateral. Carl Creditor takes a \nsecured interest in Deborah Debtor’s sailboat. She sells the boat and buys a garden tractor. The \nsecured interest attaches to the garden tractor. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1028 \n• \nFuture advances. Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor.

            "chunk": "The “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common \nfor the creditor to have possession of—actually or virtually—certified securities, deposit accounts, \nelectronic chattel paper, investment property, or other such paper or electronic evidence of value. [24] \n \nAgain, Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\" diagrams the attachment, showing the necessary elements: the \ncreditor gives value, the debtor has rights in collateral, and there is a security agreement signed \n(authenticated) by the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the creditor’s “hand” will grab (repossess) the \ncollateral. \n \nPerfection of the Security Interest \nAs between the debtor and the creditor, attachment is fine: if the debtor defaults, the creditor will \nrepossess the goods and—usually—sell them to satisfy the outstanding obligation. But unless an additional \nset of steps is taken, the rights of the secured party might be subordinated to the rights of other secured \nparties, certain lien creditors, bankruptcy trustees, and buyers who give value and who do not know of the \nsecurity interest. Perfection is the secured party’s way of announcing the security interest to the rest of \nthe world. It is the secured party’s claim on the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1032 \nThere are five ways a creditor may perfect a security interest: (1) by filing a financing statement, (2) by \ntaking or retaining possession of the collateral, (3) by taking control of the collateral, (4) by taking control \ntemporarily as specified by the UCC, or (5) by taking control automatically. \n \nPerfection by Filing \n“Except as otherwise provided…a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security agreements.” [25] \n \nThe Financing Statement \nA financing statement is a simple notice showing the creditor’s general interest in the collateral. It is \nwhat’s filed to establish the creditor’s “dibs.” \n \nContents of the Financing Statement \nIt may consist of the security agreement itself, as long as it contains the information required by the UCC, \nbut most commonly it is much less detailed than the security agreement: it “indicates merely that a person \nmay have a security interest in the collateral[.]…Further inquiry from the parties concerned will be \nnecessary to disclose the full state of affairs.” [26] The financing statement must provide the following \ninformation: \n \n• \nThe debtor’s name. Financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name, so getting that \ncorrect is important. Section 9-503 of the UCC describes what is meant by “name of debtor.” \n• \nThe secured party’s name. \n• \nAn “indication” of what collateral is covered by the financing statement.[27] It may describe the \ncollateral or it may “indicate that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal \nproperty” (such generic references are not acceptable in the security agreement but are OK in the \nfinancing statement). [28] If the collateral is real-property-related, covering timber to be cut or \nfixtures, it must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related. [29] \n \nThe form of the financing statement may vary from state to state, but see Figure 25.3 \"UCC-1 Financing \nStatement\" for a typical financing statement. Minor errors or omissions on the form will not make it \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1033 \nineffective, but the debtor’s signature is required unless the creditor is authorized by the debtor to make \nthe filing without a signature, which facilitates paperless filing. [30] \n \nFigure 25.3 UCC-1 Financing Statement \n \n \nDuration of the Financing Statement \nGenerally, the financing statement is effective for five years; a continuation statement may be filed \nwithin six months before the five-year expiration date, and it is good for another five \nyears. [31] Manufactured-home filings are good for thirty years. When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement.

                    "answer": "The financing statement in a security agreement is a simple notice showing the creditor's general interest in the collateral. It serves as a filing to establish the creditor's 'dibs.' The financing statement must provide the following information: the debtor's name, the secured party's name, and an indication of what collateral is covered by the financing statement. The debtor’s name is important because financing statements are indexed under the debtor’s name. The secured party’s name is crucial for identifying the creditor. Additionally, the financing statement should indicate the type of collateral involved, which can either be described specifically or generally stated as covering all assets or all personal property. If the collateral is real-property-related, such as timber to be cut or fixtures, the financing statement must include a description of the real property to which the collateral is related."

The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to \nthe lender for those goods. The lender is thus assured of a security interest in the collateral. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1036 \nPerfection by Control \n“A security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel \npaper may be perfected by control of the collateral.” [41] “Control” depends on what the collateral is. If it’s a \nchecking account, for example, the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has “control”: the \nbank gets a security interest automatically because, as Official Comment 3 to UCC Section 9-104 puts it, \n“all actual and potential creditors of the debtor are always on notice that the bank with which the debtor’s \ndeposit account is maintained may assert a claim against the deposit account.” “Control” of electronic \nchattel paper of investment property, and of letter-of-credit rights is detailed in Sections 9-105, 9-106, \nand 9-107. Obtaining “control” means that the creditor has taken whatever steps are necessary, given the \nmanner in which the items are held, to place itself in a position where it can have the items sold, without \nfurther action by the owner. [42] \n \nAutomatic Perfection \nThe fifth mechanism of perfection is addressed in Section 9-309 of the UCC: there are several \ncircumstances where a security interest is perfected upon mere attachment. The most important here \nis automatic perfection of a purchase-money security interest given in consumer goods. If a seller of \nconsumer goods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection of the security interest is automatic. But \nthe seller may file a financial statement and faces a risk if he fails to file and the consumer debtor sells the \ngoods. Under Section 9-320(b), a buyer of consumer goods takes free of a security interest, even though \nperfected, if he buys without knowledge of the interest, pays value, and uses the goods for his personal, \nfamily, or household purposes—unless the secured party had first filed a financing statement covering the \ngoods. \n \nFigure 25.4 Attachment and Perfection \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1037 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA creditor may be secured—allowed to take the debtor’s property upon debtor’s default—by agreement \nbetween the parties or by operation of law. The law governing agreements for personal property security is \nArticle 9 of the UCC. The creditor’s first step is to attach the security interest. This is usually accomplished \nwhen the debtor, in return for value (a loan or credit) extended from the creditor, puts up as collateral some \nvaluable asset in which she has an interest and authenticates (signs) a security agreement (the contract) giving \nthe creditor a security interest in collateral and allowing that the creditor may take it if the debtor defaults. \nThe UCC lists various kinds of assets that can be collateralized, ranging from tangible property (goods), to \nassets only able to be manifested by paper (indispensable paper), to intangible assets (like patent rights). \nSometimes no security agreement is necessary, mostly if the creditor takes possession of the collateral. After \nattachment, the prudent creditor will want to perfect the security interest to make sure no other creditors \nclaim an interest in the collateral. Perfection is most often accomplished by filing a financing statement in the \nappropriate place to put the world on notice of the creditor’s interest. Perfection can also be achieved by a \npledge (possession by the secured creditor) or by “control” of certain assets (having such control over them as \nto be able to sell them if the debtor defaults). Perfection is automatic temporarily for some items (certified \nsecurities, instruments, and negotiable documents) but also upon mere attachment to purchase-money \nsecurity interests in consumer goods. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is a creditor ill-advised to be unsecured? \n2. Elaine bought a computer for her use as a high school teacher, the school contributing one-third of its cost. \nElaine was compelled to file for bankruptcy. The computer store claimed it had perfected its interest by \nmere attachment, and the bankruptcy trustee claimed the computer as an asset of Elaine’s bankruptcy \nestate. Who wins, and why?",

                    "answer": "In a field warehouse setting, a creditor can perfect their security interest through two primary methods. Firstly, an independent company can erect a temporary structure at the site, such as fencing off the copper, thereby establishing physical control over the collateral. Alternatively, the independent company can lease the warehouse facilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are under the sale custody of the creditor. In both scenarios, the goods are physically in the possession of the field warehouse service. The creditor then segregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to the lender for those goods, ensuring the lender's security interest in the collateral."

                    "answer": "According to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or electronic chattel paper can be perfected by obtaining 'control' of the collateral. For a checking account, the bank maintaining the deposit account has 'control', and therefore, the bank automatically acquires a security interest. For electronic chattel paper, investment property, and letter-of-credit rights, specific procedures are outlined in UCC Sections 9-105, 9-106, and 9-107. Obtaining 'control' means taking the necessary steps to place the creditor in a position where they can sell the items without further action by the owner, ensuring the creditor can enforce their security interest when needed."

[4] A \nconsumer who refuses to sign such a statement thus forces the secured creditor to sell the collateral under \nSection 9-610.

Section 9-607 of the UCC provides that on default, the secured party is entitled \nto notify the third party—for example, a person who owes money on an account—that payment should be \nmade to him. The secured party is accountable to the debtor for any surplus, and the debtor is liable for \nany deficiency unless the parties have agreed otherwise. \n \nAs always in parsing the UCC here, some of the details and nuances are necessarily omitted because of \nlack of space or because a more detailed analysis is beyond this book’s scope. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUpon default, the creditor may bring a lawsuit against the debtor to collect a judgment. But the whole \npurpose of secured transactions is to avoid this costly and time-consuming litigation. The more typical \nsituation is that the creditor repossesses the collateral and then either auctions it off (sale) or keeps it in \nsatisfaction of the debt (strict foreclosure). In the former situation, the creditor may then proceed against the \ndebtor for the deficiency.

Creditors frequently ask the owners of small, closely held companies to guarantee their loans to the \ncompany, and parent corporations also frequently are guarantors of their subsidiaries’ debts. The earliest \nsureties were friends or relatives of the principal debtor who agreed—for free—to lend their guarantee. \nToday most sureties in commercial transaction are insurance companies (but insurance is not the same as \nsuretyship). \n \nA surety is one who promises to pay or perform an obligation owed by the principal debtor, and, \nstrictly speaking, the surety is primarily liable on the debt: the creditor can demand payment from the \nsurety when the debt is due. The creditor is the person to whom the principal debtor (and the surety, \nstrictly speaking) owes an obligation. Very frequently, the creditor requires first that the debtor put up \ncollateral to secure indebtedness, and—in addition—that the debtor engage a surety to make extra certain \nthe creditor is paid or performance is made. For example, David Debtor wants Bank to loan his \ncorporation, David Debtor, Inc., $100,000. Bank says, “Okay, Mr. Debtor, we’ll loan the corporation \nmoney, but we want its computer equipment as security, and we want you personally to guarantee the \ndebt if the corporation can’t pay.” Sometimes, though, the surety and the principal debtor may have no \nagreement between each other; the surety might have struck a deal with the creditor to act as surety \nwithout the consent or knowledge of the principal debtor. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1055 \nA guarantor also is one who guarantees an obligation of another, and for practical purposes, \ntherefore, guarantor is usually synonymous with surety—the terms are used pretty much \ninterchangeably. But here’s the technical difference: a surety is usually a party to the original contract and \nsigns her (or his, or its) name to the original agreement along with the surety; the consideration for the \nprincipal’s contract is the same as the surety’s consideration—she is bound on the contract from the very \nstart, and she is also expected to know of the principal debtor’s default so that the creditor’s failure to \ninform her of it does not discharge her of any liability. On the other hand, a guarantor usually does not \nmake his agreement with the creditor at the same time the principal debtor does: it’s a separate contract \nrequiring separate consideration, and if the guarantor is not informed of the principal debtor’s default, the \nguarantor can claim discharge on the obligation to the extent any failure to inform him prejudices him. \nBut, again, as the terms are mostly synonymous, surety is used here to encompass both. \n \nFigure 25.6 Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety \n \n \nTypes of Suretyship \nWhere there is an interest, public or private, that requires protection from the possibility of a default, \nsureties are engaged. For example, a landlord might require that a commercial tenant not only put up a \nsecurity deposit but also show evidence that it has a surety on line ready to stand for three months’ rent if \nthe tenant defaults. Often, a municipal government will want its road contractor to show it has a surety \navailable in case, for some reason, the contractor cannot complete the project. Many states require general \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1056 \ncontractors to have bonds, purchased from insurance companies, as a condition of getting a contractor’s \nlicense; the insurance company is the surety—it will pay out if the contractor fails to complete work on the \nclient’s house. These are types of a performance bond. A judge will often require that a criminal \ndefendant put up a bond guaranteeing his appearance in court—that’s a type of suretyship where the bail-\nbonder is the surety—or that a plaintiff put up a bond indemnifying the defendant for the costs of delays \ncaused by the lawsuit—a judicial bond. A bank will take out a bond on its employees in case they steal \nmoney from the bank—the bank teller, in this case, is the principal debtor (a fidelity bond). However, as \nwe will see, sureties do not anticipate financial loss like insurance companies do: the surety expects, \nmostly, to be repaid if it has to perform. The principal debtor goes to an insurance company and buys the \nbond—the suretyship policy. The cost of the premium depends on the surety company, the type of bond \napplied for, and the applicant’s financial history. A sound estimate of premium costs is 1 percent to 4 \npercent, but if a surety company classifies an applicant as high risk, the premium falls between 5 percent \nand 20 percent of the bond amount. When the purchaser of real estate agrees to assume the seller’s \nmortgage (promises to pay the mortgage debt), the seller then becomes a surety: unless the mortgagee \nreleases the seller (not likely), the seller has to pay if the buyer defaults. \n \nCreation of the Suretyship",

The classes of tangible goods are distinguished \nby the primary use intended. Under [the UCC] the four classes [include] “consumer goods,” “equipment,” \n“farm products” and “inventory.” \n \nThe difficulty is that the code provisions use terms arising in commercial circles which have different \nsemantical values from legal precedents. Does the fact that the purchaser bought the goods as a special \ngift to another person signify that it was not for his own “personal, family or household purposes”? The \ntrustee urges that these special facts control under the express provisions of the commercial code. \n \nBy a process of exclusion, a diamond engagement ring purchased for one’s fiancée is not “equipment” \nbought or used in business, “farm products” used in farming operations, or “inventory” held for sale, lease \nor service contracts. When the [debtor] purchased the ring, therefore, it could only have been “consumer \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1064 \ngoods” bought “primarily for personal use.” There could be no judicial purpose to create a special class of \nproperty in derogation of the statutory principles. \n \nAnother problem is implicit, although not covered by the briefs. \n \nBy the foregoing summary analysis, it is apparent that the diamond ring, when the interest of the debtor \nattached, was consumer goods since it could have been no other class of goods. Unless the fiancée had a \nspecial status under the code provision protecting a bona fide buyer, without knowledge, for value, of \nconsumer goods, the failure to file a financing statement is not crucial. No evidence has been adduced \npertinent to the scienter question. \n \nIs a promise, as valid contractual consideration, included under the term “value”? In other words, was the \nring given to his betrothed in consideration of marriage (promise for a promise)? If so, and “value” has \nbeen given, the transferee is a “buyer” under traditional concepts. \nThe Uniform Commercial Code definition of “value”…very definitely covers a promise for a promise. The \ndefinition reads that “a person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them…generally in return for any \nconsideration sufficient to support a simple contract.” \n \nIt would seem unrealistic, nevertheless, to apply contract law concepts historically developed into the law \nof marriage relations in the context of new concepts developed for uniform commercial practices. They \nare not, in reality, the same juristic manifold. The purpose of uniformity of the code should not be \ndefeated by the obsessions of the code drafters to be all inclusive for secured creditors. \n \nEven if the trustee, in behalf of the unsecured creditors, would feel inclined to insert love, romance and \nmorals into commercial law, he is appearing in the wrong era, and possibly the wrong court. \n \nOrdered, that the Rike-Kumler Company holds a perfected security interest in the diamond engagement \nring, and the security interest attached to the proceeds realized from the sale of the goods by the trustee in \nbankruptcy. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1065 \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of \nsection 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if \nthe repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or locked garage.’”…This is so \nbecause “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free \nright of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as \nseriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenport held that the creditor’s \nrepossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from \nremoving the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical \nconfrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession \noccurred).Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of \ncollateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced \nagainst the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and \nprivacy interests. \n \n“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to \nresolve disputes. Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in \na way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged \nbecause of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].",

However, mere trespass, standing alone, does not automatically constitute a breach of the peace. The court emphasized that a limited entry onto the property for the sole purpose of effectuating the repossession, without breaching any gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, buildings, or chains, does not constitute a breach of the peace. Furthermore, the court noted that the probability of violence at the time of or immediately prior to the repossession is sufficient to establish a breach of the peace, but violent conduct is not a necessary element."

One, enacted in 1974, is the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of \nobtaining the mortgage and purchasing a residence. The act covers all federally related first mortgage \nloans secured by residential properties for one to four families. It requires the lender to disclose \ninformation about settlement costs in advance of the closing day: it prohibits the lender from “springing” \nunexpected or hidden costs onto the borrower. The RESPA is a US Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) consumer protection statute designed to help home buyers be better shoppers in the \nhome-buying process, and it is enforced by HUD. It also outlaws what had been a common practice of \ngiving and accepting kickbacks and referral fees. The act prohibits lenders from requiring mortgagors to \nuse a particular company to obtain insurance, and it limits add-on fees the lender can demand to cover \nfuture insurance and tax charges. \n \nRedlining. Several statutes are directed to the practice of redlining—the refusal of lenders to make loans \non property in low-income neighborhoods or impose stricter mortgage terms when they do make loans \nthere. (The term derives from the supposition that lenders draw red lines on maps around ostensibly \nmarginal neighborhoods.) The most important of these is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of \n1977. [1] The act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated \nfinancial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation. To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine \nbanking institutions for CRA compliance and take this information into consideration when approving \napplications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions. The information is compiled under the \nauthority of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions within its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1084 \npurview to report annually by transmitting information from their loan application registers to a federal \nagency. \n \nThe Note and the Mortgage Documents \nThe note and the mortgage documents are the contracts that set up the deal: the mortgagor gets credit, \nand the mortgagee gets the right to repossess the property in case of default. \n \nThe Note \nIf the lender decides to grant a mortgage, the mortgagor signs two critical documents at the closing: the \nnote and the mortgage. We cover notes in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\". It is \nenough here to recall that in a note (really a type of IOU), the mortgagor promises to pay a specified \nprincipal sum, plus interest, by a certain date or dates. The note is the underlying obligation for which the \nmortgage serves as security. Without the note, the mortgagee would have an empty document, since the \nmortgage would secure nothing. Without a mortgage, a note is still quite valid, evidencing the debtor’s \npersonal obligation. \n \nOne particular provision that usually appears in both mortgages and the underlying notes is \nthe acceleration clause. This provides that if a debtor should default on any particular payment, the \nentire principal and interest will become due immediately at the lender’s option. Why an acceleration \nclause? Without it, the lender would be powerless to foreclose the entire mortgage when the mortgagor \ndefaulted but would have to wait until the expiration of the note’s term. Although the acceleration clause \nis routine, it will not be enforced unless the mortgagee acts in an equitable and fair manner. The problem \narises where the mortgagor’s default was the result of some unconscionable conduct of the mortgagee, \nsuch as representing to the mortgagee that she might take a sixty-day “holiday” from having to make \npayments.

If the mortgagor \ndoesn’t pay as promised, the mortgagee may repossess the real estate.

Mortgage law is regulated by state and federal statute. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1086 \n \n1.

Absent perfection, the creditor stands a \nchance of losing out to another creditor who took its interest in the goods subsequent to the first creditor. \nThe same problem is presented in real property security: the mortgagee wants to make sure it has first \nclaim on the property in case the mortgagor (debtor) defaults. \n \nThe General Rule of Priorities \nThe general rule of priority is the same for real property security as for personal property security: the \nfirst in time to give notice of the secured interest is first in right. For real property, the notice is \nby recording the mortgage. Recording is the act of giving public notice of changes in interests in real \nestate. Recording was created by statute; it did not exist at common law. The typical recording statute \ncalls for a transfer of title or mortgage to be placed in a particular county office, usually the auditor, \nrecorder, or register of deeds. \nA mortgage is valid between the parties whether or not it is recorded, but a mortgagee might lose to a \nthird party—another mortgagee or a good-faith purchaser of the property—unless the mortgage is \nrecorded. \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are exceptions to the general rule; two are taken up here. \n \nFixture Filing \nThe fixture-filing provision in Article 9 of the UCC is one exception to the general rule. As noted \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\", the UCC gives priority to purchase-money security \ninterests in fixtures if certain requirements are met. \n \nFuture Advances \nA bank might make advances to the debtor after accepting the mortgage. If the future advances are \nobligatory, then the first-in-time rule applies. For example: Bank accepts Debtor’s mortgage (and records \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1088 \nit) and extends a line of credit on which Debtor draws, up to a certain limit. (Or, as in the construction \nindustry, Bank might make periodic advances to the contractors as work progresses, backed by the \nmortgage.)

Bank has priority: by searching the mortgage records, Second Creditor \nshould have been on notice that the first mortgage was intended as security for the entire line of credit, \nalthough the line was doled out over time. \n \nHowever, if the future advances are not obligatory, then priority is determined by notice. For example, a \nbank might take a mortgage as security for an original loan and for any future loans that the bank chooses \nto make. A later creditor can achieve priority by notifying the bank with the first mortgage that it is \nmaking an advance. Suppose Jimmy mortgages his property to a wealthy dowager, Mrs. Calabash, in \nreturn for an immediate loan of $20,000 and they agree that the mortgage will serve as security for future \nloans to be arranged. The mortgage is recorded. A month later, before Mrs. Calabash loans him any more \nmoney, Jimmy gives a second mortgage to Louella in return for a loan of $10,000. Louella notifies Mrs. \nCalabash that she is loaning Jimmy the money. A month later, Mrs. Calabash loans Jimmy another \n$20,000. Jimmy then defaults, and the property turns out to be worth only $40,000. Whose claims will \nbe honored and in what order? Mrs. Calabash will collect her original $20,000, because it was recited in \nthe mortgage and the mortgage was recorded. Louella will collect her $10,000 next, because she notified \nthe first mortgage holder of the advance. That leaves Mrs. Calabash in third position to collect what she \ncan of her second advance. Mrs. Calabash could have protected herself by refusing the second loan. \n \nTermination of the Mortgage \nThe mortgagor’s liability can terminate in three ways: payment, assumption (with a novation), or \nforeclosure. \n \nPayment \nUnless they live in the home for twenty-five or thirty years, the mortgagors usually pay off the mortgage \nwhen the property is sold. Occasionally, mortgages are paid off in order to refinance. If the mortgage was \ntaken out at a time of high interest rates and rates later drop, the homeowner might want to obtain a new \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1089 \nmortgage at the lower rates. In many mortgages, however, this entails extra closing costs and penalties for \nprepaying the original mortgage. Whatever the reason, when a mortgage is paid off, the discharge should \nbe recorded. This is accomplished by giving the mortgagor a copy of, and filing a copy of, a Satisfaction of \nMortgage document. In the Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group case (Section 26.4 \n\"Cases\"), the bank mistakenly filed the Satisfaction of Mortgage document, later discovered its mistake, \nretracted the satisfaction, accelerated the loan because the mortgagor stopped making payments (the \nbank, seeing no record of an outstanding mortgage, refused to accept payments), and then tried to \nforeclose on the mortgage, meanwhile having lost the note and mortgage besides. \n \n \nAssumption \nThe property can be sold without paying off the mortgage if the mortgage is assumed by the new buyer, \nwho agrees to pay the seller’s (the original mortgagor’s) debt. This is a novation if, in approving the \nassumption, the bank releases the old mortgagor and substitutes the buyer as the new debtor. \n \nThe buyer need not assume the mortgage. If the buyer purchases the property without agreeing to be \npersonally liable, this is a sale “subject to” the mortgage (see Figure 26.3 \"“Subject to” Sales versus \nAssumption\"). In the event of the seller’s subsequent default, the bank can foreclose the mortgage and sell \nthe property that the buyer has purchased, but the buyer is not liable for any deficiency. \n \nFigure 26.3 “Subject to” Sales versus Assumption \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1090 \n \n \nWhat if mortgage rates are high? Can buyers assume an existing low-rate mortgage from the seller rather \nthan be forced to obtain a new mortgage at substantially higher rates? Banks, of course, would prefer not \nto allow that when interest rates are rising, so they often include in the mortgage a due-on-sale clause, \nby which the entire principal and interest become due when the property is sold, thus forcing the \npurchaser to get financing at the higher rates. The clause is a device for preventing subsequent purchasers \nfrom assuming loans with lower-than-market interest rates. Although many state courts at one time",

For instance, if Jimmy mortgages his property to a wealthy dowager, Mrs. Calabash, for an initial loan of $20,000 with the agreement that the mortgage serves as security for future loans, and then gives a second mortgage to Louella for $10,000, Louella must notify Mrs. Calabash of the advance.

Payment involves the mortgagor repaying the mortgage, either when selling the property or refinancing. Assuming the mortgage involves the new buyer agreeing to pay the seller’s debt, which can be a novation if the bank releases the old mortgagor and substitutes the new buyer as the debtor. However, if a bank mistakenly files a Satisfaction of Mortgage document, it can lead to significant issues. As seen in the Paul H. Cherry v. Chase Manhattan Mortgage Group case, the bank's mistake led to the mortgagor stopping payments, as the bank saw no outstanding mortgage. Consequently, the bank accelerated the loan, refused further payments, and attempted to foreclose, ultimately losing both the note and the mortgage documents. Proper recording of the satisfaction is crucial to avoid such complications and ensure that the mortgage is indeed terminated correctly."

What Kind of Consent Is Necessary. \nThis Court has already clearly held the consent required by [the relevant section] is “something more than \na mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence. It implies an agreement to that which, but for \nthe consent, could not exist, and which the party consenting has a right to forbid.” [Citations.] However, \nour Mechanics Lien Statute has never been applied in the landlord-tenant context where a third party is \ninvolved. \n \nOther jurisdictions have addressed this issue. The Court of Appeals cited [a Connecticut case, 1987] in \nsupport of its holding. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the Connecticut court’s reasoning is \npersuasive, especially since Connecticut has a similar mechanics lien statute.… \n \nThe Connecticut courts have stated “the consent required from the owner or one acting under the owner’s \nauthority is more than the mere granting of permission for work to be conducted on one’s property; or the \nmere knowledge that work was being performed on one’s land.” Furthermore, although the Connecticut \ncourts have stated the statute does not require an express contract, the courts have required “consent that \nindicates an agreement that the owner of…the land shall be, or may be, liable for the materials or labor.”… \n \nThe reasoning of [Connecticut and other states that have decided this issue] is persuasive. F & D’s brief \nappears to argue that mere knowledge by the landowner that the work needed to be done, coupled with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1108 \nthe landlord’s general “permission” to perform the work, is enough to establish consent under the statute. \nUnder this interpretation, a landlord who knew a tenant needed to improve, upgrade, or add to the leased \npremises would be liable to any contractor and/or subcontractor who performed work on his land. Under \nF & D’s interpretation the landlord would not be required to know the scope, cost, etc. of the work, but \nwould only need to give the tenant general permission to perform upgrades or improvements. \n \nClearly, if the landlord/owner or his agent gives consent directly to the materialman, a lien can be \nestablished. Consent can also be given to the tenant, but the consent needs to be specific. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent must know the scope of the project (for instance, as the lease provided in the \ninstant case, the landlord could approve written plans submitted by the tenant). The consent needs to be \nmore than “mere knowledge” that the tenant will perform work on the property. There must be some kind \nof express or implied agreement that the landlord may be held liable for the work or material. The \nlandlord/owner or his agent may delegate the project or work to his tenant, but there must be an express \nor implied agreement about the specific work to be done. A general provision in a lease which allows \ntenant to make repairs or improvements is not enough. \n \nC.

He \ntestified the following language granted him the authority to perform the electrical upfit, so that \nhe was not required to submit the plans to BG Holding as required by a provision in the lease: \n“Lessor shall allow Lessee to put Office Trailer in Building. All Utilities necessary to handle \nLessee’s equipment shall be paid for by the Lessee including, but not limited to electricity, water, \nsewer, and gas.” (We note that BG Holding denies this interpretation, but insists it just requires \nthe Lessee to pay for all utility bills.) \n• \nPowder Coaters no longer occupies the property, and BG Holding possibly benefits from the work \ndone. \n \nIn the instant case, there is some evidence of consent.

However, we agree with the Court of Appeals, that F & D has not presented enough \nevidence to show: (1) BG Holding gave anything more than general consent to make improvements (as the \nlease could be interpreted to allow); or (2) BG Holding had anything more that “mere knowledge” that the \nwork was to be done. Powder Coaters asserted the lease’s addendum evidenced BG Holding’s consent to \nperform the modifications; however, there is no evidence BG Holding expressly or implicitly agreed that it \nmight be liable for the work. In fact, the lease between Powder Coaters and BG Holding expressly \nprovided Powder Coaters was responsible for any alterations made to the property. Even Powder Coaters \nacknowledged it was not authorized to bind BG Holding.…Therefore, it is impossible to see how the very \ngeneral provision requiring Powder Coaters to pay for water, sewer, and gas can be interpreted to \nauthorize Powder Coaters to perform an electrical upgrade. Furthermore, we agree with the Court of \nAppeals that the mere presence of BG Holding’s agent at the work site is not enough to establish consent. \n \nConclusion \nWe hold consent, as required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute, is something more than mere knowledge \nwork will be or could be done on the property.

Currin told Sheth that the notice indicated the sale was to be at the Third \nAvenue entrance, and that the sale had been held at the correct location. Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003. The lawsuit asked \nfor declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages. The trial court granted the defendants’ summary \njudgment motion on August 8, 2003. Alpha appeals. \n \nLocation of the Sale \n \nAlpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the \nAdministration Building. Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are \nheld at the Administration Building. The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders \nand trustees to that location if asked. In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a \n‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there. We disagree. Alpha \nhas not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location. The evidence shows that the \ncounty had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect. \nHowever, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from \nbeing held there. Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent.

Alpha \nsubmitted evidence that the property had an ‘as is’ value of $4.35 million in December 2002, and an \nestimated 2004 value of $5.2 million. The debt owed to SFI on the property was $4.1 million. SFI bought \nthe property for $2.1 million. These facts do not suggest that the sale must be set aside. \n \nWashington case law suggests that the price the property is sold for must be ‘grossly inadequate’ for a \ntrustee’s sale to be set aside on those grounds alone. In Cox [Citation, 1985], the property was worth \nbetween $200,000 and $300,000, and was sold to the beneficiary for $11,873. The Court held that \namount to be grossly inadequate In Steward [Citation, 1988] the property had been purchased for \napproximately $64,000, and then was sold to a third party at a foreclosure sale for $4,870. This court \nheld that $4,870 was not grossly inadequate. In Miebach [Citation] (1984), the Court noted that a sale for \nless than two percent of the property’s fair market value was grossly inadequate. The Court \nin Miebach also noted prior cases where the sale had been voided due to grossly inadequate purchase \nprice; the properties in those cases had been sold for less than four percent of the value and less than \nthree percent of the value. In addition, the Restatement indicates that gross inadequacy only exists when \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1116 \nthe sale price is less than 20 percent of the fair market value—without other defects, sale prices over 20 \npercent will not be set aside. [Citation.] The Property was sold for between 40 and 48 percent of its value. \nThese facts do not support a grossly inadequate purchase price. \n \nAlpha cites Miebach for the proposition that ‘where the inadequacy of price is great the sale will be set \naside with slight indications of fraud or unfairness,’ arguing that such indications existed here. However, \nthe cases cited by the Court in Miebach to support this proposition involved properties sold for less than \nthree and four percent of their value. Alpha has not demonstrated the slightest indication of fraud, nor \nshown that a property that sold for 40 to 48 percent of its value sold for a greatly inadequate price. \n \nDuty to a Junior Lienholder \nAlpha claims that Currin owed a duty to Alpha, the junior lienholder. Alpha cites no case law for this \nproposition, and, indeed, there is none—Division Two specifically declined to decide this issue in Country \nExpress [Citation]. Alpha acknowledges the lack of language in RCW 61.24 (the deed of trust statute) \nregarding fiduciary duties of trustees to junior lienholders. But Alpha argues that since RCW 61.24 \nrequires that the trustee follow certain procedures in conducting the sale, and allows for sales to be \nrestrained by anyone with an interest, a substantive duty from the trustee to a junior lienholder can be \ninferred. \n \nAlpha’s arguments are unavailing.

Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off.

By the 1980s, they soared to over 450,000 filings per year and maintained that pace until just before the 2005 law took effect.

These include Chapter 7 (Liquidation), which applies to all debtors except certain entities like railroads, insurance companies, most banks and credit unions, and homestead associations. It involves selling the debtor's nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to creditors. About 70% of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. Chapter 9 (Adjustment of debts of a municipality) applies to municipalities that are insolvent and want to adjust their debts. Chapter 11 (Reorganization) applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads, allowing financially troubled companies to continue operating while restructuring their finances. Chapter 12 (Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual income) is specifically for farmers with debts up to $1.5 million. Chapter 13 (Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income) permits individuals with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million to establish a repayment plan.

But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the \nparticular debtor—otherwise, one creditor may file an involuntary petition, as long as his claim is for at \nleast $13,475; (3) there must be no bona fide dispute about the debt owing. If there is a dispute, the debtor \ncan resist the involuntary filing, and if she wins the dispute, the creditors who pushed for the involuntary \npetition have to pay the associated costs. Persons owing less than $13,475, farmers, and charitable \norganizations cannot be forced into bankruptcy. \n \nThe Automatic Stay \nThe petition—voluntary or otherwise—operates as a stay against suits or other actions against the debtor \nto recover claims, enforce judgments, or create liens (but not alimony collection). In other words, once the \npetition is filed, the debtor is freed from worry over other proceedings affecting her finances or property. \nNo more debt collection calls! Anyone with a claim, secured or unsecured, must seek relief in the \nbankruptcy court. This provision in the act can have dramatic consequences. Beset by tens of thousands of \nproducts-liability suits for damages caused by asbestos, UNR Industries and Manville Corporation, the \nnation’s largest asbestos producers, filed (separate) voluntary bankruptcy petitions in 1982; those filings \nautomatically stayed all pending lawsuits. \n \nFirst Meeting of Creditors \nOnce a petition in bankruptcy is filed, the court issues an order of relief, which determines that the \ndebtor’s property is subject to bankruptcy court control and creates the stay. The Chapter 7 case may be \ndismissed by the court if, after a notice and hearing, it finds that among other things (e.g., delay, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1130 \nnonpayment of required bankruptcy fees), the debts are primarily consumer debts and the debtor could \npay them off—that’s the 2005 act’s famous “means test,” discussed in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 \nLiquidation\". \n \nAssuming that the order of relief has been properly issued, the creditors must meet within a reasonable \ntime. The debtor is obligated to appear at the meeting and submit to examination under oath. The judge \ndoes not preside and, indeed, is not even entitled to attend the meeting. \n \nWhen the judge issues an order for relief, an interim trustee is appointed who is authorized initially to \ntake control of the debtor’s assets. The trustee is required to collect the property, liquidate the debtor’s \nestate, and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. The trustee may sue and be sued in the name of the \nestate. Under every chapter except Chapter 7, the court has sole discretion to name the trustee. Under \nChapter 7, the creditors may select their own trustee as long as they do it at the first meeting of creditors \nand follow the procedures laid down in the act. \nTrustee’s Powers and Duties \nThe act empowers the trustee to use, sell, or lease the debtor’s property in the ordinary course of business \nor, after notice and a hearing, even if not in the ordinary course of business. In all cases, the trustee must \nprotect any security interests in the property. As long as the court has authorized the debtor’s business to \ncontinue, the trustee may also obtain credit in the ordinary course of business. She may invest money in \nthe estate to yield the maximum, but reasonably safe, return. Subject to the court’s approval, she may \nemploy various professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and appraisers, and may, with some \nexceptions, assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases that the debtor has made. The \ntrustee also has the power to avoid many prebankruptcy transactions in order to recover property of the \ndebtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate.

He must sell the \nproperty for money, close up the estate “as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of parties \nin interest,” investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, examine proofs of claims, reject improper ones, \noppose the discharge of the debtor where doing so is advisable in the trustee’s opinion, furnish a creditor \nwith information about the estate and his administration (unless the court orders otherwise), file tax \nreports if the business continues to be operated, and make a final report and file it with the court. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1143 \n \nConversion \nUnder Section 706 of the bankruptcy code, the debtor may convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 11, 12, or \n13 at any time. The court may order a conversion to Chapter 11 at any time upon request of a party in \ninterest and after notice and hearing. And, as discussed next, a case may be converted from Chapter 7 to \nChapter 13 if the debtor agrees, or be dismissed if he does not, in those cases where the debtor makes too \nmuch money to be discharged without it being an “abuse” under the 2005 act. \n \nDismissal \nThe court may dismiss a case for three general reasons. \n \nThe first reason is “for cause,” after notice and a hearing for cause, including (1) unreasonable delay by the \ndebtor that prejudices creditors, (2) nonpayment of any fees required, (3) failure to file required \ndocuments and schedules. \n \nThe second reason for dismissal (or, with the debtor’s permission, conversion to Chapter 11 or 13) applies \nto debtors whose debt is primarily consumer debt: the court may—after notice and a hearing—dismiss a \ncase if granting relief would be “an abuse of the provisions” of the bankruptcy code. \nThe third reason for dismissal is really the crux of the 2005 law: under it, the court will find that granting \nrelief under Chapter 7 to a debtor whose debt is primarily consumer debt is “an abuse” if the debtor makes \ntoo much money. The debtor must pass a means test: If he’s poor enough, he can go Chapter 7. If he is not \npoor enough (or if they are not, in case of a married couple), Chapter 13—making payments to creditors—\nis the way to go. Here is one practitioner’s explanation of the means test: \nTo apply the means test, the courts will look at the debtor’s average income for the 6 months prior \nto filing [not the debtor’s income at the time of filing, when—say—she just lost her job] and \ncompare it to the median income for that state. For example, the median annual income for a \nsingle wage-earner in California is $42,012. If the income is below the median, then Chapter 7 \nremains open as an option.

                    "answer": "A Chapter 7 bankruptcy case can be dismissed for three main reasons: for cause, due to an abuse of the bankruptcy provisions, and because the debtor's income is too high, making them ineligible for Chapter 7. The first reason involves issues like unreasonable delay by the debtor, non-payment of required fees, or failure to file necessary documents. The second reason applies specifically to debtors with primarily consumer debt, where the court may dismiss the case if granting relief would be considered an abuse of the bankruptcy code. This typically happens after a notice and hearing. The third reason, introduced by the 2005 BAPCPA, states that a case can be dismissed if the debtor's income is too high, rendering them ineligible for Chapter 7. Under this provision, the court conducts a means test, comparing the debtor's average income over the six months preceding the filing to the median income for their state. If the debtor's income exceeds the state's median, they are deemed ineligible for Chapter 7 and must opt for Chapter 13, which allows for payment plans to creditors."

This list is not exhaustive: \n \n1. The debtor is not an individual. In a Chapter 7 case, a corporation or partnership does not receive a \nbankruptcy discharge; instead, the entity is dissolved and its assets liquidated. The debts remain \ntheoretically valid but uncollectible until the statute of limitations on them has run. Only an \nindividual can receive a Chapter 7 discharge. [3] \n2. The debtor has concealed or destroyed property with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay within twelve \nmonths preceding filing of the petition. \n3. The debtor has concealed, destroyed, or falsified books and records \n4. The debtor has lied under oath, knowingly given a false account, presented or used a false claim, \ngiven or received bribes, refused to obey court orders. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1147 \n5.

The debtor failed to participate in “an instructional course concerning personal financial \nmanagement” (unless that’s excused). \n8. An individual debtor has “abused” the bankruptcy process. A preferential transfer is not an “abuse,” \nbut it will be set aside. Making too much money to file Chapter 7 is “an abuse” that will deny \ndischarge. \n \nA discharge may be revoked if the debtor committed fraud during the bankruptcy proceedings, but the \ntrustee or a creditor must apply for revocation within one year of the discharge. \n \nHaving the discharge denied does not affect the administration of the bankruptcy case. The trustee can \n(and will) continue to liquidate any nonexempt assets of the debtor and pay the creditors, but the debtor \nstill has to pay the debts left over. \nAs to any consequence of discharge, bankruptcy law prohibits governmental units from discriminating \nagainst a person who has gone through bankruptcy. Debtors are also protected from discrimination by \nprivate employers; for example, a private employer may not fire a debtor because of the bankruptcy. \nCertainly, however, the debtor’s credit rating will be affected by the bankruptcy. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy case may be dismissed for cause or because the debtor has abused the system. The \ndebtor is automatically considered to have abused the system if he makes too much money. With the debtor’s \npermission, the Chapter 7 may be converted to Chapter 11, 12, or 13. The law requires that the debtor pass a \nmeans test to qualify for Chapter 7. Assuming the debtor does qualify for Chapter 7, her nonexempt assets (if \nthere are any) are sold by the trustee and distributed to creditors according to a priority set out in the law. A \ndischarge may be denied, in general because the debtor has behaved dishonestly or—again—has abused the \nsystem. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1148 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understand that there are nonbankruptcy alternatives for debtors who cannot pay their bills in a timely \nway: assignment for benefit of creditors, compositions, and receiverships. \n2. Recognize the reasons why these alternatives might not work. \n \n \nAlternatives to Bankruptcy: Overview \nBankruptcy is a necessary thing in a capitalist economic system. As already noted, without it, few people \nwould be willing to take business risks, and the economy would necessarily operate at a lower level \n(something some people might not think so bad overall). But bankruptcy, however “enlightened” society \nmay have become about it since Victorian days, still carries a stigma. Bankruptcy filings are public \ninformation; the lists of people and businesses who declare bankruptcy are regularly published in monthly \nbusiness journals. Bankruptcy is expensive, too, and both debtors and creditors become enmeshed in \nsignificantly complex federal law. For these reasons, among others, both parties frequently determine it is \nin their best interest to find an alternative to bankruptcy. Here we take up briefly three common \nalternatives. \n \nIn other parts of this book, other nonbankruptcy creditors’ rights are discussed: under the Uniform \nCommercial Code (UCC), creditors have rights to reclaim goods sold and delivered but not paid for; under \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1156 \nthe UCC, too, creditors have a right to repossess personal property that has been put up as collateral for \nthe debtor’s loan or extension of credit; and mortgagees have the right to repossess real estate without \njudicial assistance in many circumstances. These nonbankruptcy remedies are governed mostly by state \nlaw. \n \nThe nonbankruptcy alternatives discussed here are governed by state law also. \n \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors; Compositions; Receivership \nAssignment for Benefit of Creditors \nUnder a common-law assignment for the benefit of creditors, the debtor transfers some or all of his \nassets to a trustee—usually someone appointed by the adjustment bureau of a local credit managers’ \nassociation—who sells the assets and apportions the proceeds in some agreed manner, usually pro rata, to \nthe creditors. Of course, not every creditor need agree with such a distribution. Strictly speaking, the \ncommon-law assignment does not discharge the balance of the debt. Many state statutes attempt to \naddress this problem either by prohibiting creditors who accept a partial payment of debt under an \nassignment from claiming the balance or by permitting debtors to demand a release from creditors who \naccept partial payment. \n \nComposition \nA composition is simply an agreement by creditors to accept less than the full amount of the debt and to \ndischarge the debtor from further liability. As a contract, composition requires consideration; the mutual \nagreement among creditors to accept a pro rata share of the proceeds is held to be sufficient consideration \nto support the discharge. The essential difference between assignment and composition lies in the \ncreditors’ agreement: an assignment implies no agreement among the creditors, whereas a composition \ndoes. Not all creditors of the particular debtor need agree to the composition for it to be valid. A creditor \nwho does not agree to the composition remains free to attempt to collect the full sum owed; in particular, \na creditor not inclined to compose the debt could attach the debtor’s assets while other creditors are \nbargaining over the details of the composition agreement. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1157 \nOne advantage of the assignment over the composition is that in the former the debtor’s assets—having",

                    "question": "What is the primary difference between filing for Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy, particularly in terms of the business owner's ability to continue operating the business?",
                    "answer": "The primary difference between filing for Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy, especially concerning the business owner's ability to continue operating the business, lies in the nature of the restructuring process and the potential for ongoing operations. In Chapter 11, the business owner or the company can develop a plan to pay off its debts over a period of three to five years. This plan needs to be approved by creditors and the court, allowing the business to continue operating while it seeks to restructure its financial obligations. On the other hand, Chapter 7 bankruptcy involves liquidating the company's assets to pay off creditors. Once the assets are sold, the business typically ceases operations unless a buyer steps in to acquire the business and its assets. Thus, the key distinction is that Chapter 11 provides a framework for a company to remain operational during the bankruptcy process, whereas Chapter 7 focuses on liquidation and closure."

                    "question": "How do property settlement debts in divorce proceedings differ from alimony and child support debts in terms of dischargeability under Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and what implications does this have for individuals facing financial distress?",
                    "answer": "Property settlement debts in divorce or separation proceedings are generally dischargeable under Chapter 13 bankruptcy, meaning that an individual can obtain relief from these debts through the bankruptcy process. However, debts for alimony and child support are not dischargeable under Chapter 13. This means that even if an individual files for Chapter 13, they will still be required to make payments for alimony and child support as originally ordered. This distinction is significant because it affects the feasibility of using Chapter 13 as a tool for financial relief. Individuals facing financial distress may find that Chapter 13 is not the best option if they owe substantial alimony or child support, as they would still be obligated to meet those financial obligations, potentially limiting their ability to reduce other debts. Conversely, if the main source of financial pressure comes from property settlement debts, Chapter 13 could offer a more viable path to debt management and financial recovery."

Also, the assignment does not require \ncreditors’ consent. However, an advantage to the debtor of the assignment (compared with the \ncomposition) is that in the composition creditors cannot go after the debtor for any deficiency (because \nthey agreed not to). \n \nReceivership \nA creditor may petition the court to appoint a receiver; receivership is a long-established procedure in \nequity whereby the receiver takes over the debtor’s property under instructions from the court. The \nreceiver may liquidate the property, continue to operate the business, or preserve the assets without \noperating the business until the court finally determines how to dispose of the debtor’s property. \n \nThe difficulty with most of the alternatives to bankruptcy lies in their voluntary character: a creditor who \nrefuses to go along with an agreement to discharge the debtor can usually manage to thwart the debtor \nand her fellow creditors because, at the end of the day, the US Constitution forbids the states from \nimpairing private citizens’ contractual obligations. The only final protection, therefore, is to be found in \nthe federal bankruptcy law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBankruptcy is expensive and frequently convoluted. Nonbankruptcy alternatives include assignment for the \nbenefit of creditors (the debtor’s assets are assigned to a trustee who manages or disposes of them for \ncreditors), compositions (agreements by creditors to accept less than they are owed and to discharge the \ndebtor from further liability), and receivership (a type of court-supervised assignment). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What is an assignment for benefit of creditors? \n2. What is a composition? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1158 \n3. What is a receivership? \n4. Why are these alternatives to bankruptcy often unsatisfactory? \n \n \n \n \n27.6 Cases \n \nDischargeability of Student Loans under Chapter 7 \nIn re Zygarewicz \n423 B.R. 909 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Cal. 2010) \n \nMCMANUS, BANKRUPTCY JUDGE. \n \nAngela Zygarewicz, a chapter 7 debtor and the plaintiff in this adversary proceeding, borrowed 16 \ngovernment-guaranteed student [sic] loans totaling $81,429. The loans have been assigned to Educational \nCredit Management Corporation (“ECMC”). By September 2009, the accrual of interest on these student \nloans had caused the debt to balloon to more than $146,000. The debtor asks the court to declare that \nthese student loans were discharged in bankruptcy. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code provides financially distressed debtors with a fresh start by discharging most of \ntheir pre-petition debts.…However, under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8), there is a presumption that educational \nloans extended by or with the aid of a governmental unit or nonprofit institution are nondischargeable \nunless the debtor can demonstrate that their repayment would be an undue hardship. See [Citation]. This \nexception to a bankruptcy discharge ensures that student loans, which are typically extended solely on the \nbasis of the student’s future earnings potential, cannot be discharged by recent graduates who then pocket \nall of the future benefits derived from their education. See [Citation]. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1159 \nThe debtor bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to a \ndischarge of the student loan. See [Citation]. That is, the debtor must prove that repayment of student \nloans will cause an undue hardship. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code does not define “the undue hardship.” Courts interpreting section 523(a)(8), \nhowever, have concluded that undue hardship [and] is something more than “garden-variety hardship.” \n[Citation.] Only cases involving “real and substantial” hardship merit discharges. See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of",

                    "question": "How do bankruptcy alternatives like assignment for the benefit of creditors, compositions, and receiverships differ from bankruptcy, and why might they be unsatisfactory?",
                    "answer": "Bankruptcy alternatives such as assignment for the benefit of creditors, compositions, and receiverships are often voluntary agreements that do not provide the same level of protection against creditors as federal bankruptcy law. Unlike bankruptcy, these alternatives can be thwarted by a single creditor who refuses to participate. Specifically, in assignment for the benefit of creditors, the debtor’s assets are assigned to a trustee who manages or disposes of them for creditors, providing asset protection but requiring no creditor consent. Compositions involve agreements by creditors to accept less than they are owed and to discharge the debtor, but creditors cannot go after the debtor for any deficiency. Receivership, on the other hand, involves a court-appointed receiver taking over the debtor’s property under court instructions, potentially liquidating or operating the business. The difficulty with these alternatives lies in their voluntary nature, as they rely on creditor cooperation, which can be lacking. Furthermore, the US Constitution prohibits states from impairing private citizens' contractual obligations, making these alternatives less reliable than federal bankruptcy law."

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial",

                    "answer": "In the early 1980s, Bacon Signs experienced a significant improvement in its financial performance due to several key factors. Firstly, the owner recognized the superior quality of the custom signs built by the firm, which were installed for national franchises. This realization prompted the owner to work closely with the company's banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a comprehensive production, sales, and financing plan. This plan was designed to cater to the needs of larger national sign companies, who agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then committed to delivering these signs on time and under budget, ensuring quality and reliability. As a result, Bacon Signs' reputation for quality grew, leading to increased demand for its products. The original financing plan, which anticipated potential growth, was structured to meet the firm's capital requirements, enabling it to expand strategically when necessary. Thus, the combination of quality products, strategic planning, and effective financing played a crucial role in Bacon Signs' improved financial performance."

                    "answer": "The study of finance is essential for making better business decisions because it equips individuals with the knowledge and tools to understand the uses and sources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-offs. By studying finance, people can learn about the three primary areas of study: business finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions. In the context of business finance, managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of their firms in a risky environment. This involves focusing on three broad areas: working capital management (WCM), capital budgeting, and capital structure. WCM helps in managing short-term assets and liabilities effectively, while capital budgeting involves determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire to maximize shareholder value. Capital structure questions help financial managers work with various sources of external financial support. Understanding these concepts allows managers to make informed decisions that positively impact the wealth of shareholders and overall business value. Additionally, finance provides a framework for assessing risks and returns, enabling businesses to allocate resources efficiently and sustainably. Therefore, the study of finance is instrumental in enhancing decision-making capabilities and ensuring financial stability and growth for businesses."

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities.

Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts",

                    "answer": "The risk-return tradeoff implies that riskier investments over time have provided greater returns, but this is not always true and under all conditions. Essentially, the concept suggests that investors need to be compensated with higher expected returns to accept higher levels of risk. This principle applies to various financial decisions such as choosing between buying a required textbook for a class versus relying on professor's notes and the internet, deciding whether to buy a used car sight unseen or have a mechanic inspect it, or accepting a first job offer or waiting for a better one. Understanding the trade-off between risk and return is crucial in finance as it helps individuals and organizations assess the appropriateness of taking risks in their financial decisions. In simpler terms, it means that if you're willing to take on more risk, you might earn more rewards, but if you want to minimize risk, you'll likely receive lower returns. This idea is fundamental in making financial decisions because it allows decision-makers to weigh potential risks against potential gains, ensuring they make informed choices."

Default risk refers to the chance that the issuer of a financial security will fail to make the required payment, such as a homeowner failing to make a mortgage payment or a corporation defaulting on bond interest payments. Inflation risk arises when the purchasing power of cash flows from an investment decreases due to rising prices or inflation. Diversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, is the risk associated with holding individual securities or small portfolios, which can often be mitigated by diversifying into a larger, more comprehensive portfolio. Non-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, remains after diversification and is typically measured using a statistical term called beta. Political risk involves macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers, such as government actions that can disrupt firm cash flows. Each type of risk affects investments differently, and understanding them is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and manage their portfolios effectively."

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\nmillion!”\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater\nrisk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text,\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,\ndespite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate\nof return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount\nyou would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.\nScenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of Table 1.2. In both scenarios, only\nfive $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents\ncould make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater\ntime leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.\nAverage Annual Rate of Return = 10%\nAssumptions\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\nStarting investment age\n26\n19\n14\n9\nEnding investment age\n60\n25\n18\n13\nTotal investments\n35\n7\n5\n5\nTable 1.2 Four Investment Scenarios: Assumptions and Expected Outcomes\n1.8 • Concepts of Time and Value\n29\nAverage Annual Rate of Return = 10%\nAssumptions\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\nAnnual investment\n$5,000\n$5,000\n$5,000\n$5,000\nTotal investment amount\n$175,000\n$35,000\n$25,000\n$25,000\nValue at age 60\n$1,490,634 $1,466,369 $1,838,858 $2,961,500\nTable 1.2 Four Investment Scenarios: Assumptions and Expected Outcomes\nDefinition of Economic Value\nValue is a term used frequently in business and especially in economics, accounting, and finance.

When deciding whether to save or spend, individuals must consider their short-, intermediate-, and long-term objectives. Short-term goals often require the safety of principal and minimal compounding returns, while intermediate-term investments aim for higher returns with increased risk. Long-term investments offer the benefit of time to recover from poor performance and compound returns, but they come with higher risk and expected returns. Additionally, factors such as inflation, market volatility, and personal circumstances must be taken into account. For instance, starting to save early can provide a substantial head start due to the power of compounding, as demonstrated in the investment scenarios provided. This underscores the importance of considering timing and risk tolerance in financial planning."

The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.\nDepreciation records an expense for the value of an asset consumed and removes that portion of the asset\nfrom the balance sheet. The journal entry to record depreciation is shown in Figure 4.11.\n4\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. “Waste Management, Inc.

It represents the\namount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\nthrough depreciation.\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFixed Assets\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania.

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows.

Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships\nbetween items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to\nanother, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).\n5.7\nCommon-Size Statements\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nPrepare common-size statements.\n•\nAssess organizational performance using common-size statements.\n•\nUse industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.\nCommon-Size Income Statements\nA common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\neach item on the income statement is:\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n149\nFigure 5.20 Common-Size Income Statement\nIt may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement.

                    "answer": "Customer and vendor payment terms significantly influence a firm's cash flow. Customer payment terms dictate how quickly a firm receives payment after providing goods or services, while vendor payment terms determine how long a firm can delay paying suppliers. For instance, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely make payment within 10 days, whereas a customer with terms of net 60 might take approximately 60 days to pay. The difference of 50 days in these examples means that the firm will spend 50 more days without receiving cash to cover the cost of providing goods or services. Similarly, a firm can choose to accept short-term terms from vendors, such as net 10, which requires quick payment, or opt for more favorable terms like net 30 or net 60, allowing the firm to retain cash for a longer period. This highlights the importance of managing these terms to optimize cash flow."

Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of\nits sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent.

It is possible that Charlie rents\nsome of its equipment, which would help explain the higher rent percentage. Finally, Charlie’s salaries\npercentage is significantly higher at 12 percent than Clear Lake’s 5 percent.

Both the balance\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\nearnings per share is\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).",

                    "answer": "Earnings per share (EPS) measures the portion of a corporation's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. An increasing EPS can drive up a stock price, while falling EPS can lower a stock's market price. This is because higher EPS often indicates better performance and profitability of the company, which may attract more investors and increase demand for the stock, thereby raising its price. Conversely, declining EPS might signal potential financial difficulties or reduced profitability, leading to decreased investor confidence and a drop in stock price."

                    "answer": "The basic earnings per share is calculated by first subtracting the preferred dividends from the net income to get the profit available to common shareholders. Then, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period is used as the denominator. For instance, if a corporation started with 600 common shares, issued 1,000 more on April 1, and had the original 600 shares from January 1 to March 31 and a total of 1,600 shares from April 1 to December 31, the weighted average would be calculated by applying fractional weights to both the initial and subsequent shares. The formula is: (600 * 3/12 + 1,600 * 9/12) = 1,450. This method ensures that the EPS reflects the average number of shares outstanding over the entire reporting period, providing a more accurate representation of the company's financial health and profitability per share."

The ratio is helpful in comparing performance and stock price of a company to other\ncompanies. It’s also helpful in evaluating how much investors are willing to pay for earnings performance.\nInvestors, in particular, use this ratio and rely on two key characteristics: past performance (trailing) and\nfuture estimates (forward). Trailing data can be calculated but is also easily found online, as it’s a common\nmeasure reported on financial sites. Investors will often look for P/E TTM, which is the price/earnings ratio for\nthe trailing 12 months (last year worth of earnings data). This helps investors assess one day’s stock price\nrelative to the earnings per share over the past 12 months. P/E ratio is widely used by investors to determine if\na stock is over- or undervalued. It also helps them compare one firm to that of the industry average or index,\nsuch as the S&P 500.\nIn the prior section we saw earnings per share data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Using its current year\nearnings per share of $3.75 and the current stock price of $69.41, we can calculate price/earnings ratio for\nClear Lake Sporting Goods:\nAn 18.51 ratio means an investor would expect to invest $18.51 to gain $1 of earnings.\nBook Value per Share\nBook value per share is often used hand in hand with market value per share. Investors compare the two in\norder to see if the stock is possibly over- or undervalued. Book value is derived from accounting practices and\nshows the value of the firm on paper. Market value, on the other hand, is determined by supply and demand,\nbased on what investors are willing to pay for the stock. If the market value per share is higher than the book\nvalue, the stock is considered overvalued. If the market value is lower than the book value, it’s considered\nundervalued.\nIn theory, book value per share represents the total value common shareholders would receive if the firm\nwere liquidated. It is total equity less preferred equity, spread across the total shares outstanding. The formula\nto calculate book value per share is\nThe book value per share for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is\nIf investors compared the book value per share of $10.00 for Clear Lake Sporting Goods to the P/E ratio of\n$18.51, they would likely conclude that the stock was undervalued in the year of analysis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nBook Value versus Market Value of Shares\nThis video about book value and market value (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-book-value) explains\nthe basic concepts and discusses how the two differ.

The company\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\nProfit Margin\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\nThe formula for profit margin is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit. If Clear Lake Sporting Goods thinks this is too\nlow, the company would try to find ways to reduce expenses and increase sales.\nReturn on Total Assets\nThe return on total assets measures the company’s ability to use its assets successfully to generate a profit.\nThe higher the return (ratio outcome), the more profit is created from asset use. Average total assets are\nfound by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the balance sheet. The\nbeginning total assets balance in the current year is taken from the ending total assets balance in the prior\nyear. The formula for return on total assets is\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the return on total assets for the current year is\nThe higher the figure, the better the company is using its assets to create a profit.

This is known as the DuPont method.\nIt originated in 1919 when the DuPont company implemented it for internal measurement purposes.2 The\nDuPont method can be expressed using this formula:\nProfit margin indicates how much profit is generated by each dollar of sales and is computed as shown:\nTotal asset turnover indicates the number of sales dollars produced by every dollar invested in capital\nassets—in other words, how efficiently the company is using its capital assets to generate sales.

When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\nRisk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up\nearning more than that single dollar.\nTo summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important\nbecause they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their\nmoney today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\ninflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings\ndollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects of inflation.\n220\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nOpportunity Costs\nThe concept of opportunity cost arises from the idea that there will always be possible options that are\nsacrificed with every option we decide on or for every choice that we make. For example, let’s consider the\ndecision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will\ninvolve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years\nof potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school.\nAlso, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have\nhad a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.\nOf course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to\ncollege, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you\nwould have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a\nrisk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the\nroad than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs\nand the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone\nfinancial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that\nthese choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our\nforgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.\nFor example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an\nopportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. In another\nexample, being able to calculate the future value of your money will tell you that instead of investing, you\nprobably should be paying down your 24% APR credit card debt that is costing you hundreds of dollars a\nmonth—hundreds of dollars more than you might earn from an investment account.\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n221\nSummary\n7.1 Now versus Later Concepts\nThis section discussed the underlying concepts of the time value of money (TVM). Because it is possible to earn\ninterest income on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or an interest-bearing account, money\nthat you have now or receive sooner will be more valuable to you than the same amount of money received\nlater.\n7.2 Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics\nFuture value refers to the value that a current amount will eventually grow into at a given interest rate over a\nspecific period of time. The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance",

The syntax\nfor the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is\n=EFFECT(rate,periods)\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n251\nwhere rate is the nominal rate and periods represents the number of periods within a year.\nEarlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over\n19.56% (see Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7 Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate\nNote several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.\nExcel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization. We’ll revisit our 36-month auto loan for $32,000\nat 6% per year, compounded monthly. A loan amortization table for a fixed interest rate debt is usually\nformatted as follows, with the Interest and Principal columns interchangeable:\nPeriod\nPayment\nInterest\nPrincipal\nBalance\nIn Excel, a table is completed by using the function PMT. The individual steps follow.\n1.\nList the information about the loan in the upper left of the worksheet, and create the column headings for\nthe schedule of amortization. Type “B5” (without the quotation marks) in cell E9 to begin the schedule.\nThen enter 1 for the first month under the Payment # (or Month) column, in cell A10 (see Figure 8.8).\n252\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.8 Step 1 of Creating an Amortization Table\n2.\nNext, in cell B10, the payment is derived from the formula =PMT(rate,periods,pv), with PV representing the\npresent value, or the loan amount. Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate\nand periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The\ndollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t\nattempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as an absolute\nreference (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.9 Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table\n3.\nThe next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this\ncase cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference. The\nremaining balance of the loan should always be multiplied by this monthly percentage (see Figure 8.10).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n253\nFigure 8.10 Step 3 of Creating an Amortization Table\n4.\nBecause this is a fixed-rate loan, whatever is left from each payment after first deducting the interest\nrepresents principal, the amount by which the balance of the outstanding loan balance is reduced.\nTherefore, the contents of cell D10 represent B10, the total payment, minus C10, the interest portion (see\nFigure 8.11). No dollar signs are included because this cell reference can adjust to each row into which this\nformula is replicated, as will be seen in the following examples.\nFigure 8.11 Step 4 of Creating an Amortization Table\n5.\nBecause our principal portion of the last payment has reduced our outstanding balance, it is subtracted\nfrom the preceding balance in cell E9 (see Figure 8.12).

These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy. Common benchmark rates include the US Treasury note rate, the Federal Reserve funds rate\n(federal funds rate), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the prime rate.\nSo, investors who decide to purchase normal (fixed rate) bonds may not be thrilled to hear that the economy is\nsignaling inflation and that interest rates are forecasted to rise. These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate\nbonds.\nBonds with very low coupon rates are referred to as deep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the\ngreatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero. The smaller the coupon rate, the\ngreater the change in price when interest rates move.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRelationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/relationship-bond-prices) explaining the relationship between\nbond prices and interest rates within financial and capital markets.\n10.2\nBond Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDetermine the value (price) of a bond.\n•\nUnderstand the characteristics of and differences between discount and premium bonds.\n•\nDraw a timeline indicating bond cash flows.\n•\nDifferentiate between fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds.\n•\nDetermine bond yields.\nPricing a Bond in Steps\nWhy do we want to learn how to price a bond? The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of\nassets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. What is its value\nto these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\nfrom willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you\nwant to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.\nLet’s begin our pricing examples with the 3M Company corporate bond listed in Table 10.1 above. The table\n288\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninformation tells us that 3M issued a series of corporate bonds that promise to pay coupons annually on\nSeptember 19 and to pay back the principal, or face value, on the maturity date of September 19, 2026. While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.",

                    "answer": "A bondholder receives two types of cash inflows from a bond investment: the payment of the par value at maturity (face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (interest income) from the bond. These two types of inflows necessitate separate present value calculations because the payment of the par value at maturity is a single lump sum payment made at the end of the bond's term, while the periodic coupon payments are regular cash flows that occur during the life of the bond. Present value calculations are used to determine the current value of these future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the risk associated with receiving those payments at different points in time."

                    "answer": "The relationship between bond prices and interest rates is inverse; when interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This inverse relationship is due to the fact that the fixed interest payments of bonds become less attractive when new bonds are issued at higher interest rates. As a result, existing bonds with lower interest rates are worth more to potential buyers. Floating-rate bonds, however, are not affected by changes in interest rates in the same way as fixed-rate bonds. Floating-rate bonds have a variable interest rate that is tied to a benchmark interest rate, such as the LIBOR or the federal funds rate. Therefore, when interest rates rise, the value of fixed-rate bonds declines, while the value of floating-rate bonds remains relatively stable, as their interest rates adjust accordingly to reflect the new market conditions."

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\nYield to Maturity\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM? We\ncan use our same three trusty methods: equations, a financial calculator, and Microsoft Excel (as shown at the\nend of the chapter).\n2\nAdam Hayes. “What Do Constantly Low Bond Yields Mean for the Stock Market?” Investopedia.

We call this kind of bond a premium bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate is less than the YTM, the bond sells at a discounted amount, or less than its par\nvalue. We refer to such a bond as a discount bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value. Bonds that experience this\nscenario in the market are referred to as par value bonds.\nThe interest or coupon payments of a bond are determined by its coupon rate and are calculated by\nmultiplying the face value of the bond by this coupon rate.\nThe inverse relationship of interest rates and bond prices is an important concept for investors to know.\nBecause interest rates fluctuate and can change significantly over time, it is important to understand how\nthese changes will impact bond values.\n10.3\nUsing the Yield Curve\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nUse the yield curve to show the term structure of interest rates.\n•\nDescribe and define changes in the yield curve shape.\n•\nExplain the importance of the yield curve shape.\n296\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTerm Structure of Interest Rates\nThe expected yields of various bonds across different maturity periods are referred to as the term structure of\ninterest rates. This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called a yield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting\nprocess and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will\nalways be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or time periods on\nthe x-axis (see Figure 10.5).\nTo create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds\nat all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year\nremaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on the y-axis against the one-year\nterm on the x-axis. Similarly, yields on government bonds with two years remaining until maturity are\ncalculated and plotted on the y-axis against two years on the x-axis, and so on, until a point of critical mass of\ninformation is reached and the resulting graph displays useful information.\nThe yield curve for government bonds is also known as the risk-free yield curve because these securities are\nthought of as safe investments that are not expected to fail or default and will in all likelihood repay or\notherwise meet all financial obligations made through the bond issuance.\nFigure 10.5 A Normal Yield Curve: Long-Term Rates Are Higher Than Short-Term Rates\nA normal yield curve slopes upward, with yield increasing as the term increases. This is because yields on\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\nrisk.\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors.

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\nrates over the three-year period.\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-\nincome investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but\nthe curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,\nresulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems.

The level of the yield curve is closely related to the overall interest rate environment and can provide insights into the state of the economy. A normal yield curve, where long-term rates are higher than short-term rates, typically occurs during periods of economic expansion when growth and inflation are increasing. This suggests that investors expect future interest rates to be higher than current rates, leading to a steeper upward-sloping curve. Conversely, an inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, is considered unusual and is often a signal of a potential economic downturn. An inverted yield curve can occur when central banks reduce interest rates to stimulate a stagnant economy, causing short-term rates to fall below long-term rates.

These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on.

                    "answer": "Bond rating services evaluate the default risk of a bond by analyzing various factors including the financial health of the issuer, economic conditions, and the specific terms of the bond issue. They use a rating system to assign grades that reflect the likelihood of the bond's repayment. Investment-grade bonds, which are rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) or Baa (Moody’s) and above, are considered to have a low risk of default and are favored by commercial banks and pension funds due to regulatory requirements. These bonds are deemed strong and stable by the investment community, making them popular choices for investors seeking reliable returns without high risk."

            "chunk": "Generating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\nthat only included long-term bonds.\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate bond valuations using Excel.\n•\nDemonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.\nCalculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond\nThe following examples illustrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to calculate common bond problems.\nPlease be sure to refer to the chapters on the time value of money for examples of using spreadsheets to solve\npresent value problems, as these same concepts are also used in solving bond problems.\nYou can use the following steps in Excel to determine the price or present value of a coupon bond.

                    "question": "What happens to the value of a bond when interest rates rise and how does this affect an investor who sells their bond before maturity?",
                    "answer": "When interest rates rise, the value of a bond falls. This is because the higher interest rates make newly issued bonds more attractive to investors, causing the demand for existing bonds to decrease. If an investor needs to sell their bond before maturity due to a requirement for funds, they might have to sell it at a discount below its face value, resulting in a capital loss. For example, if an investor originally purchased a corporate bond yielding 7%, but the economy changes and comparable bonds now yield 10%, the investor would need to lower the price of their 7% bond to match the new market rate of 10%. Consequently, potential buyers would be less likely to purchase the bond at its original price, leading to a capital loss for the seller."

                    "question": "How does the bond laddering strategy work and what are its key benefits for investors?",
                    "answer": "Bond laddering is a strategic approach where an investor divides their total investment across multiple bonds that mature at different intervals, typically in one-year increments. For instance, an investor might purchase 10 different bonds with maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, up to 10 years. When the shortest-term bond matures, the investor reinvests the proceeds into a new bond with the longest remaining maturity, thereby maintaining a consistent ladder structure. This strategy offers several key benefits: it diversifies the portfolio, reducing the overall risk associated with holding a single type of bond. Shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability since they are less sensitive to interest rate fluctuations compared to longer-term bonds. Additionally, longer-term bonds within the ladder offer higher returns but come with increased risk, particularly from rising interest rates. By investing in a mix of bonds with varying maturities, investors can achieve superior returns compared to investing solely in short-term bonds. Moreover, the bond ladder reduces the overall risk profile of the investment, making it less susceptible to the volatility of long-term bonds. This makes the bond ladder a versatile and effective investment strategy for both novice and seasoned investors."

To answer our questions, we will look at two forms of\nefficiency: operational efficiency and informational efficiency.\nOperational Efficiency\nOperational efficiency concerns the speed and accuracy of processing a buy or sell order at the best available\nprice. Through the years, the competitive nature of the market has promoted operational efficiency.\nIn the past, the NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) used a designated-order turnaround computer system\nknown as SuperDOT to manage orders. SuperDOT was designed to match buyers and sellers and execute\ntrades with confirmation to both parties in a matter of seconds, giving both buyers and sellers the best\n11.5 • Efficient Markets\n345\navailable prices. SuperDOT was replaced by a system known as the Super Display Book (SDBK) in 2009 and\nsubsequently replaced by the Universal Trading Platform in 2012.\nNASDAQ used a process referred to as the small-order execution system (SOES) to process orders. The\npractice for registered dealers had been for SOES to publicly display all limit orders (orders awaiting execution\nat specified price), the best dealer quotes, and the best customer limit order sizes. The SOES system has now\nbeen largely phased out with the emergence of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever\nhigher trading volumes.\nPublic access to the best available prices promotes operational efficiency. This speed in matching buyers and\nsellers at the best available price is strong evidence that the stock markets are operationally efficient.\nInformational Efficiency\nA second measure of efficiency is informational efficiency, or how quickly a source reflects comprehensive\ninformation in the available trading prices. A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12). If an investor does not\nreceive the most current information, the prices are “stale”; therefore, they are at a trading disadvantage.\nFigure 11.12 Forms of Market Efficiency A market is efficient if it provides all information that is available.\nForms of Market Efficiency\nFinancial economists have devised three forms of market efficiency from an information perspective: weak\nform, semi-strong form, and strong form. These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market. In other words, technical analysis cannot beat the market. The market itself\nis the best technical analyst out there.\n346\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n11.1 Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nThis section introduced common stock and some of the models and calculation methods used by investors\nand financial analysts to determine the prices or values of common shares. The most evaluative ratios that can\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\nlower, more stable growth.\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\n11.4 Preferred Stock",

According to this concept, a price is considered efficient if the market has utilized all available information to set it, implying that stocks trade at their fair value. For instance, in weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock's price history and trading volume. Therefore, attempting to predict future stock prices based on historical data is futile because the market already incorporates all such information. This means that technical analysis cannot consistently outperform the market. In semi-strong form efficient markets, not only does the price reflect historical data, but it also accounts for all public information, making it equally challenging to find undervalued or overvalued stocks through public information alone. Finally, in strong form efficient markets, all information, including insider information, is reflected in stock prices, meaning that even private information cannot be used to gain an advantage in trading."

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term.

The implication for investment strategies is that while a well-diversified portfolio might include investments in the S&P 500, it should also consider smaller capitalization stocks, international markets, and other asset classes to achieve a balanced and comprehensive approach to investing."

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes.

Furthermore, if the investor had missed the 10 best days, the balance would have ended at only $313,377, which is less than half of the return earned in the full time period.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\nthan the returns realized for equities.\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks",

He believes that the rearview mirror is clearer than the windshield, suggesting that past performance can inform future decisions but should not be the sole focus. Buffett encourages a perspective where one thinks about the consequences of their investments on a broader scale. He famously stated, 'If you’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.' This indicates his belief that wealth should be used responsibly and with consideration for societal impact. Additionally, Buffett has initiated the Giving Pledge alongside Bill and Melinda Gates, encouraging billionaires to commit to giving away at least half of their fortunes during or after their lifetimes. This initiative underscores his view that great wealth comes with a responsibility to回馈社会。"

To date, the pledge has attracted commitments from over 200 billionaires to donate at least half of their fortunes. This reflects Buffett's belief that those fortunate enough to amass significant wealth have a moral obligation to contribute to society. In terms of his personal approach to wealth distribution, Buffett has left a lasting legacy by setting an example of responsible philanthropy. Moreover, he has provided specific advice to his children about inheritance, stating, 'A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do nothing.' This advice suggests that while children should be adequately provided for, they should also be motivated to work and contribute to society independently. Through these actions and words, Buffett demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that his wealth serves a greater purpose beyond just personal gain."

An example of paired data would be if data were collected on employees’ years of experience and\ntheir corresponding salaries. Typically, it is of interest to investigate possible associations or correlations\nbetween the two variables under analysis.\nTime Series Graphs\nSuppose that we want to track the consumer price index (CPI) over the past 10 years. One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph\nfor the (rounded) annual CPI data (see Table 13.12).

Each year's CPI value is plotted as a point on the graph, with the year corresponding to the position on the horizontal axis and the CPI value corresponding to the position on the vertical axis. After plotting all the points, connect them with straight lines in chronological order to illustrate the trend of the CPI over the years.

We must remember that correlation\ndoes not imply causation.\nTest a Correlation Coefficient for Significance\nThe correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and\ny. The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the\nentire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,\nwhich is labeled as the Greek letter ρ (pronounced “rho”). But because we have only sample data, we cannot\ncalculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the\nunknown population correlation coefficient.\n•\nρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)\n•\nr = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)\nAn important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are\nasking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions for y based on values of x. One\nmethod to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us\ndecide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is close to zero or significantly different\nfrom zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.\nIf the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the\ncorrelation coefficient is significant.\n•\nConclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x\nand y variables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\n•\nWhat the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between the x and y variables. If the\ntest concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we\nsay that the correlation coefficient is not significant.\nA hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical\nmethod that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the\nhypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficient ρ is equal to zero.\nUse these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:\n•\nNull hypothesis:\n•\nAlternate hypothesis:\nThe hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:\n•\nNull hypothesis\n: The population correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

There\nis a significant linear relationship (correlation) between x and y in the population.\nA quick shorthand way to test correlations is the relationship between the sample size and the correlation. If\nthen this implies that the correlation between the two variables demonstrates that a linear\nrelationship exists and is statistically significant at approximately the 0.05 level of significance. As the formula\nindicates, there is an inverse relationship between the sample size and the required correlation for significance\nof a linear relationship.

We can explore these questions using\nregression analysis.\nTable 14.6 shows a summary of monthly closing prices of the DJIA and the Russell 2000 for a 12-month time\nperiod.

Most investors, however, own\nshares of stock in multiple companies. This collection of stocks is known as a portfolio. Let’s explore why it is\nwise for investors to hold a portfolio of stocks rather than to pick just one favorite stock to own.\nWe saw that investors who owned DAL experienced an average annual return of 20.87% but also a large\nstandard deviation of 51.16%. Investors who used all their funds to purchase DAL stock did exceptionally well\nduring 2012–2014. But in 2020, those investors lost almost one-third of their money as COVID-19 caused a\nsharp reduction in air travel worldwide. To protect against these extreme outcomes, investors practice what is\ncalled diversification, or owning a variety of stocks in their portfolios.\nSuppose, for example, you have saved $50,000 that you want to invest. If you purchased $50,000 of DAL stock,\nyou would not be diversified. Your return would depend solely on the return on DAL stock. If, instead, you used\n$5,000 to purchase DAL stock and used the remaining $45,000 to purchase nine other stocks, you would be\ndiversifying. Your return would depend not only on DAL’s return but also on the returns of the other nine\nstocks in your portfolio. Investors practice diversification to manage risk.\nIt is akin to the saying “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you place all of your eggs in one basket\nand that basket breaks, all of your eggs will fall and crack. If you spread your eggs out across a number of\nbaskets, it is unlikely that all of the baskets will break and all of your eggs will crack. One basket may break,\nand you will lose the eggs in that basket, but you will still have your other eggs. The same idea holds true for\ninvesting. If you own stock in a company that does poorly, perhaps even goes out of business, you will lose the\nmoney you placed in that particular investment.

Suppose that you see an advertisement in which McKinley\nInvestment Management claims that the portfolios of its clients have an average return of 20% per year. You\nknow that this average annual return is meaningless without also knowing something about the riskiness of\nthe firm’s strategy. In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.\nA basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is the Sharpe ratio. The\nSharpe ratio is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s\nreturn, using the formula\nThe portfolio risk premium is the portfolio return RP minus the risk-free return Rf; this is the basic reward for\nbearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on\ntheir portfolios have an excess return of 17%.\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio’s return,\n, is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s\nclients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the\nclients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility\nleads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be\n, or 0.65.\nThus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator\ncan be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for\ntaking on that risk.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. You can visit Sharpe’s Stanford\nUniversity website (https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe) to find videos in which he discusses financial\ntopics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.\nTreynor Measurement of Performance\nAnother reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is the Treynor ratio. The Treynor ratio\nis calculated as\nJust as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is\nthat the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,\nwhile the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the\n15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement\n465\ndenominator.\nIf McKinley Investment Management has a portfolio with a 20% return over the past five years, with a beta of\n1.2 and a risk-free rate of 3%, the Treynor ratio would be\nBoth the Sharpe and Treynor ratios are relative measures of investment performance, meaning that there is\nnot an absolute number that indicates whether an investment performance is good or bad. An investment\nmanager’s performance must be considered in relation to that of other managers or to a benchmark index.\nJensen’s Alpha\nJensen’s alpha is another common measure of investment performance. It is computed as the raw portfolio\nreturn minus the expected portfolio return predicted by the CAPM:\nSuppose that the average market return has been 12%. What would Jensen’s alpha be for McKinley Investment\nManagement’s portfolio with a 20% average return and a beta of 1.2?\nUnlike the Sharpe and Treynor ratios, which are meaningful in a relative sense, Jensen’s alpha is meaningful in\nan absolute sense.

It is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s return, using the formula: Sharpe ratio = (RP - Rf) / σ(RP), where RP is the portfolio return, Rf is the risk-free return, and σ(RP) is the standard deviation of the portfolio’s return. This ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio, with the standard deviation in the denominator representing the units of risk the investor has, and the numerator being the reward the investor is receiving for taking on that risk."

                    "answer": "The Treynor ratio is another reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance. While the Sharpe ratio uses the standard deviation of the portfolio's returns in the denominator to measure total risk, the Treynor ratio focuses on systematic risk by using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator. The formula for the Treynor ratio is: Treynor ratio = (RP - Rf) / β(Portfolio), where RP is the portfolio return, Rf is the risk-free rate, and β(Portfolio) is the portfolio's beta. This means that the Treynor ratio provides a different perspective on risk-adjusted performance by focusing specifically on the systematic risk rather than total risk."

This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple\nof the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\nEqual Annuity Approach\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\n•\nThe NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\n•\nThe NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\nproject.\n•\nFor the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\n•\nFor the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\nformula.\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\npositive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within\nbudget constraints.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nProfitability Index\nManagers should reject any project with a negative NPV.

                    "answer": "The Equal Annuity Approach is a method used to compare projects with different lifespans by assuming that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated forever. This approach involves several steps. First, the Net Present Value (NPV) of each project is calculated. Then, an annuity is determined that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the project. After finding these annuities, the projects are assumed to be repeated indefinitely, and their present values are calculated using the perpetuity formula. This allows for a fair comparison between projects with different lifespans. In the provided example, the larger, older ice-cream truck had an NPV of $49,474, which corresponds to a three-year annuity of $19,894, while the smaller, newer ice-cream truck had an NPV of $80,658, corresponding to a six-year annuity of $18,520. Despite the newer truck having a higher NPV, the older truck was deemed more favorable due to its lower annuity requirement, indicating a better return per period."

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash\nflows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the\nIRR method; unlike IRR, which may have multiple mathematical solutions, MIRR will result in one solution. The\nprofitability index is calculated as the NPV of the project divided by the initial cost of the project.\n16.5 Choosing between Projects\nFirms may need to choose among a variety of good projects.

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases. Trade-off theory suggests that the value of a company that uses debt\nequals the value of the unlevered firm plus the value of the interest tax shield minus financial distress costs.\n17.6 Alternative Sources of Funds\nPreferred stock is a type of equity capital; the owners of preferred stock receive preferential treatment over\ncommon stockholders in the order of claimants. A fixed dividend is paid to preferred shareholders and must\nbe paid before common shareholders receive dividends. Equity capital can be raised through either retaining\nearnings or selling new shares of stock. Significant flotation costs are associated with issuing new shares of\nstock, making it the most expensive source of financing. Convertible debt allows the debt holders to convert\ntheir debt into a fixed number of common shares instead of receiving the face value of the stock at maturity.\nKey Terms\nafter-tax cost of debt\nthe net cost of interest on a company’s debt after taxes; the firm’s effective cost of\ndebt\ncapital\na company’s sources of financing\n17 • Summary\n529\ncapital structure\nthe percentages of a company’s assets that are financed by debt capital, preferred stock\ncapital, and common stock capital\nconversion price\nthe face value of a convertible bond divided by its conversion ratio\nconversion ratio\nthe number of shares of common stock receivable for each convertible bond that is\nconverted\nconvertible bonds\nbonds that can be converted into a fixed number of shares of common stock upon\nmaturity\nfinancial distress\nwhen a firm has trouble meeting debt obligations\nfinancial leverage\nthe debt used in a company’s capital structure\nflotation costs\ncosts involved in the issuing and placing of new securities\ninterest tax shield\nthe reduction in taxes paid because interest payments on debt are a tax-deductible\nexpense; calculated as the corporate tax rate multiplied by interest payments\nlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has debt outstanding\nnet debt\na company’s total debt minus any cash or risk-free assets the company holds\npreferred stock\nequity capital that has a fixed dividend; preferred shareholders fall in between debt holders\nand common stockholders in the order of claimants\ntrade-off theory\na theory stating that the total value of a levered company is the value of the firm without\nleverage plus the value of the interest tax shield less financial distress costs\nunlevered equity\nequity in a firm that has no debt outstanding\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC)\nthe average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted\nby the fractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity\nCFA Institute\nThis chapter supports some of the Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) in this CFA® Level I Study Session",

It’s critical that all members of the team take the time and effort to research their\ncustomers and the factors that impact their business in order to effectively assess the impact of these factors\non future sales. Though only two adjustments were made here, it’s likely that a large firm would have to\nconsider many, many factors that would ultimately impact monthly sales figures before arriving at a\nconclusion.\n18.3\nPro Forma Financials\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine pro forma in the context of a financial forecast.\n•\nDescribe the factors that impact the length of a financial forecast.\n•\nExplain the risks associated with a financial forecast.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will move beyond the sales forecast and look at the general nature, length,\nand timeline of forecasts and the risks associated with using them.

Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth. Growing just for the sake of growing doesn’t always yield favorable income for\nthe firm. A larger top-line sales figure that results in lower net income doesn’t make sense in the grand\nscheme of things. The same is true of profitable sales that don’t generate enough cash flows at the right time.\nThe firm may make a profit, but if it doesn’t manage the timing of its cash flows, it could be forced to shut\ndown if it can’t cover the costs of payroll or keep the lights on. Forecasting helps assess both cash flow and the\nprofitability of future growth. Managers can forecast cash flow using data from forecasted financial\nstatements; this allows them to identify potential gaps in cash and plan ahead in order to either alter collection\nand payment policies or obtain funding to cover the gap in the timing of cash flows.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPro Forma Financial Statements\nReview the video Business Plan and Pro-Forma Financial Statements (https://openstax.org/r/\nBusiness_Plan_and_Pro-Forma_Financial_Statements) to learn about the basics of pro forma financial\nstatements and why they are helpful.\n544\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLength of a Forecast\nForecasts can generally be for any length of time. The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts. Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements",

It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months. Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential",

                    "answer": "Running a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales during Clear Lake Sporting Goods' busy season requires significant upfront funding, which in this case amounts to $30,000. Given that the store had a projected cash deficit of $13,000 at the end of the first quarter, the additional $30,000 for the ad campaign would exacerbate the need for funding. This scenario underscores the importance of considering both increased operational costs and advertising expenses when evaluating whether such initiatives are financially viable. Excel serves as a powerful tool in managing and analyzing these forecasts. By setting up a forecast in Excel, managers can input various variables and observe how changes ripple through the model, allowing them to assess the impact of different scenarios. For instance, altering the sales figures and variable costs based on economic assumptions such as a recession can provide insights into the financial performance under adverse conditions. This capability enables Clear Lake Sporting Goods to make informed decisions about strategic investments and marketing efforts, ensuring that they align with their financial goals."

Other credit\nmanagement techniques, some of which are explained in subsequent sections, can help minimize and control\nthe receivables collection period.\nThe payables deferral period is the one element that probably cannot be optimized without violating credit\nterms. Certainly, cash balances can be conserved by delaying payments to vendors for as long as possible;\nhowever, payments on trade credit need to be made on time or the company’s relationship with the supplier\ncan suffer. In a worst-case scenario, the company’s credit rating could also deteriorate.\nA credit rating, also called a credit score, is a measure produced by an independent agency indicating the\n572\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nlikelihood that a company will meet its financial obligations as they come due; it is an indication of the\ncompany’s ability to pay its creditors. Three business credit rating services are Equifax Small Business,\nExperian Business, and Dun & Bradstreet.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle\nConsidering the previous Think It Through (Scenario 1), what if you could reduce inventory levels, hold\nlower accounts receivable balances, and rely more heavily on accounts payable while maintaining the same\nsales level?\nHere’s Scenario 2. Because of better inventory management, credit and collections management, and\nnegotiation of longer payment periods with vendors, King Sized Products (KSP) Inc. needs less investment\nin inventory and accounts receivable and is able to utilize a greater amount of trade credit financing.\nAnnual credit sales are $40,000,000, average inventory is $2,800,000, average accounts receivable are\n$5,500,000, average accounts payable are $3,300,000, and cost of goods sold is $30,000,000. What is the\ncash conversion cycle?\nSolution:\nInventory conversion period:\n•\n•\n•\nReceivables collection period:\n•\n•\nPayables deferral period:\n•\n•\nNotice that the investment in inventory and accounts receivable is less and the average accounts payable is\nmore with no change in credit sales and cost of goods sold—you would certainly anticipate a reduction in\nthe cash conversion cycle. The improvement would be about 13 days (from 57.2 in Scenario 1 to 44.1 days in\nScenario 2). Figure 19.4 shows a bar chart comparison of the two scenarios.\nScenario 1 Scenario 2\nInventory Conversion Period\n36.50\n34.07\nReceivables Collection Period\n54.75\n50.21\nPayables Deferral Period\n34.07\n40.15\nCash Conversion Cycle\n57.18\n44.10\nTable 19.2\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n573\nFigure 19.4 Scenario 1 and 2 Comparison: Shortening the Cash Conversion Cycle\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA Harvard Business School blog post, How Amazon Survived the Dot-Com Bubble (https://openstax.org/r/\nhow-amazon-survived), discusses how Amazon managed its cash conversion cycle to the point where it was\nreceiving payment for the things it sold before Amazon had to pay for them. In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution. A better\nbenchmarking approach is to compare a firm’s ratios—current ratio and quick ratios—to the average of the\nindustry in which the subject company operates.\nTake, for example, a home construction company. Such as firm has a long operating cycle because of the\nproduction process (building homes), and the “storage of finished goods” can result in very high current\nratios—such as 11 or 12 times current liabilities—whereas a retailer like Walmart or Target would have much\nlower current ratios.\nIn recent years, Walmart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has had a current ratio of around 0.9 and has been able to\nmanage its working capital needs by efficient management of its supply chain, quick turnover of inventory,\nand a very small investment in accounts receivables.1 Big retailers like Walmart are effective at negotiating\nfavorable payment terms with their vendors. The ability to generate consistent positive cash flow from\noperations allows a retailer like Walmart to operate with relatively low amounts of working capital.\nThe credit policies of a company also affect working capital. A company with a liberal credit policy will require a\ngreater amount of working capital, as collection periods of accounts receivable are longer and therefore tie up\n1",

The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in\nconsultation with the sales and financial management departments.\nMonitoring Accounts Receivables\nFinancial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581\nFigure 19.6 Foodinia Inc. Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note",

Concepts such as just-in-time (JIT) inventory practices and economic order\nquantity (EOQ) are tools used by inventory managers, both of which help keep a company lean (minimizing\ninventory) while making sure the inventory resources are in place in time to complete the sale.\nBenefit of Holding Inventory\nBrick-and-mortar stores need goods in stock so that the customer can see and touch the product and be able\nto acquire it when they need it. Customers are disappointed if they cannot see and touch the item or if they\nfind out upon arrival at the store that it is out of stock.\nCustomers of all kinds don’t want to wait for the delivery of a purchase. We have become accustomed to\nAmazon orders being delivered to the door the next day. Product fulfillment and availability is important.\nInventory must be in stock, or sales will be lost.\nIn manufacturing, the inventory of materials and component parts must be in place at the start of the value\nchain (the conversion process), and finished goods need to be ready to meet scheduled shipments. Holding\nsufficient inventory meets customer demand, whether it is products on the shelves or in the warehouse that\nare ready to move through the supply chain and into the hands of the customer.\n19.6\nUsing Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCreate a one-year budget.\n•\nCreate a cash budget.\nA cash budget is a tool of cash management and therefore assists financial managers in the planning and\ncontrol of a critical asset. The cash budget, like any other budget, looks to the future. It projects the cash flows\ninto and out of the company. The budgeting process of a company is a really an integrated process—it links a\nseries of budgets together so that company objectives can be achieved. For example, in a manufacturing\ncompany, a series of budgets such as those for sales, production, purchases, materials, overhead, selling and\nadministrative costs, and planned capital expenditures would need to be prepared before cash needs (cash\nbudget) can be predicted.\nJust as you might budget your earnings (salary, business income, investment income, etc.) to see if you will be\nable to cover your expected living expenses and planned savings amounts, to be successful and to increase\nthe odds that sufficient cash will be available in the months ahead, financial managers prepare cash budgets\nto\n•\nmeet payrolls;\n•\nallocate dollars for contingencies and emergencies;\n•\nanalyze if planned collections and disbursements policies and procedures result in adequate cash\nbalances; and\n•\nplan for borrowings on lines of credit and short-term loans that might be needed to balance the cash\nbudget.\nA cash budget is a model that often goes through several iterations before managers can approve it as the\n584\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nplan going forward. Changes in any of the “upstream” budgets—budgets that are prepared before the cash\nbudget, such as the sales, purchases, and production budgets—may need to be revised because of changing\nassumptions. New economic forecasts and even cost-cutting measures will require a revision of the cash\nbudget.\nAlthough a budget might be prepared for each month of a future 12-month period, such as the upcoming\nfiscal year, a rolling budget is often used. A rolling budget changes often as the planning period (e.g., a fiscal\nyear) plays out. When one month ends, another month is added to the end (the next column) of the budget.\nFor example, if in your budget January is the first month of the planning period, once January is over, next\nJanuary’s cash budget column would be added—right after December’s column (at the far right of the\nbudget).\nSample One-Year (Annual) Operating Budget\nPreparing an annual operating budget can be a complex task. In essence, a company budget is a series of\nbudgets, many of which are interrelated.\nThe sales budget is prepared first and has an impact on many other budgets.

If the spot rate is\n, the option writer will be obligated\nto sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN\n50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher\nthan\n, the writer of the call option will have a loss.\nThe option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the\nloss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer\nof the option receives.\nPut Options\nWhile the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option\ngives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset.

                    "answer": "In financial contexts, 'capital gains' refers to the profit realized from the sale of an asset, such as real estate, stocks, or other investments, where the selling price is higher than the purchase price. It is essentially the difference between the sale price and the original cost basis of the asset. On the other hand, 'capital gain yield' is a specific type of return on investment that measures the percentage increase in the value of an asset over a certain period, which is directly related to the capital gains. While 'capital gains' is a broader term encompassing the actual profits made from selling assets, 'capital gain yield' focuses on the rate of return on those gains."
