With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the \ninternational community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet \nUnion, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. \nWhen Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly \nfor home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups \nof families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be \nseen. \n \nLaw and Politics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n5 \nIn the United States, legislators, judges, administrative agencies, governors, and presidents make law, \nwith substantial input from corporations, lobbyists, and a diverse group of nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) such as the American Petroleum Institute, the Sierra Club, and the National Rifle Association. In \nthe fifty states, judges are often appointed by governors or elected by the people. The process of electing \nstate judges has become more and more politicized in the past fifteen years, with growing campaign \ncontributions from those who would seek to seat judges with similar political leanings. \n \nIn the federal system, judges are appointed by an elected official (the president) and confirmed by other \nelected officials (the Senate). If the president is from one party and the other party holds a majority of \nSenate seats, political conflicts may come up during the judges’ confirmation processes. Such a division \nhas been fairly frequent over the past fifty years. \n \nIn most nation-states (as countries are called in international law), knowing who has power to make \nand enforce the laws is a matter of knowing who has political power; in many places, the people or groups \nthat have military power can also command political power to make and enforce the laws. Revolutions are \ndifficult and contentious, but each year there are revolts against existing political-legal authority; an \naspiration for democratic rule, or greater “rights” for citizens, is a recurring theme in politics and law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLaw is the result of political action, and the political landscape is vastly different from nation to nation. \nUnstable or authoritarian governments often fail to serve the principal functions of law. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Consider Burma (named Myanmar by its military rulers). What political rights do you have that the average \nBurmese citizen does not? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n6 \n2. What is a nongovernment organization, and what does it have to do with government? Do you contribute \nto (or are you active in) a nongovernment organization? What kind of rights do they espouse, what kind of \nlaws do they support, and what kind of laws do they oppose? \n \n \n[1] Black’s Law Dictionary, 6th ed., s.v. “law.” \n \n \n \n1.2 Schools of Legal Thought \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Explain why natural law relates to the rights that the founders of the US political-legal system found \nimportant. \n3. Describe legal positivism and explain how it differs from natural law. \n4. Differentiate critical legal studies and ecofeminist legal perspectives from both natural law and legal \npositivist perspectives. \n \n \nThere are different schools (or philosophies) concerning what law is all about. Philosophy of law is also \ncalled jurisprudence, and the two main schools are legal positivism and natural law. Although \nthere are others (see Section 1.2.3 \"Other Schools of Legal Thought\"), these two are the most influential in \nhow people think about the law. \n \nLegal Positivism: Law as Sovereign Command \nAs legal philosopher John Austin concisely put it, “Law is the command of a sovereign.” Law is only law, \nin other words, if it comes from a recognized authority and can be enforced by that authority, \nor sovereign—such as a king, a president, or a dictator—who has power within a defined area or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n7 \nterritory.

                    "answer": "Post-colonial nations have faced challenges in establishing unified governments due to the presence of various ethnic and tribal factions which have often made it hard for a single government to rule effectively. For instance, in Rwanda, power struggles between Hutus and Tutsis led to the genocide of the Tutsi minority. Similarly, when the Soviet Union disintegrated, ethnic leaders took advantage of the resulting power vacuums. The breakup of Yugoslavia further exemplified this issue, as Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians fought fiercely for control of their territories instead of sharing power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the challenge lies in the integration of diverse groups like families, tribes, sects, and ethnicities into a cohesive national governing body that can share power. These historical and ongoing conflicts highlight the complexity of uniting disparate populations under a single governmental structure."

                    "answer": "In most nation-states, the ability to create and enforce laws is closely tied to political power. This means that those who hold political power, whether through elected positions or through military might, also have the authority to make and enforce laws. This relationship underscores the importance of political stability and the rule of law in maintaining order and protecting citizens' rights. However, the exercise of political power can sometimes lead to instability or authoritarianism, which may undermine the primary functions of law, such as maintaining peace and promoting social justice. Additionally, the appointment or election of judges and the confirmation of judicial appointments can be influenced by political considerations, leading to potential conflicts of interest and partisan divisions. These dynamics illustrate the complex interplay between political power and the law, highlighting the need for checks and balances to ensure that the law serves the interests of all citizens and not just those in power."

When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives \nand a Senate. The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances.

The House of Representatives is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in each state, with the number of districts determined by the population as measured every ten years through the census. Each state gets at least one district, with more populous states having more districts. In contrast, the Senate has two senators from each state, regardless of population, ensuring that each state has equal representation in this chamber. This structure means that less than 20% of the nation's population can send 50 senators to Washington, which many view as antidemocratic. The proportional nature of the House versus the fixed representation in the Senate can lead to challenges in passing legislation, as reconciling different versions of bills from both chambers can be complex, especially if they significantly diverge."

Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

An agency only has the \npower that the legislature gives it. Within the scope of that power, an agency will often create regulations \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"), which have the same force and effect as statutes. Treaties are never \nnegotiated and concluded by states, as the federal government has exclusive authority over relations with \nother nation-states. A treaty, once ratified by the Senate, has the same force and effect as a statute passed by \nCongress and signed into law by the president. \nConstitutions, statutes, regulations, treaties, and court decisions can provide a legal basis in the positive law. \nYou may believe you have been wronged, but for you to have a right that is enforceable in court, you must \nhave something in the positive law that you can point to that will support a cause of action against your \nchosen defendant. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n29 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Describe how the common-law system differs from the civil-law system. \n \n \nOther legal and political systems are very different from the US system, which came from English \ncommon-law traditions and the framers of the US Constitution. Our legal and political traditions are \ndifferent both in what kinds of laws we make and honor and in how disputes are resolved in court. \n \nComparing Common-Law Systems with Other Legal Systems \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n30 \nThe common-law tradition is unique to England, the United States, and former colonies of the British \nEmpire. Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French",

                    "answer": "The common-law system, which originated in England and is followed in the United States and former British colonies, is fundamentally different from civil-law systems that are based on Roman and Napoleonic law. In the common-law system, judges play a crucial role in developing the law through their rulings, and previous court decisions serve as precedents for future cases. This means that judges often rely on past judicial interpretations and case law to make decisions, which can lead to a body of case law that evolves over time. In contrast, civil-law systems rely on comprehensive legislative codes that contain all the necessary legal rules. Judges in these systems primarily apply the law as codified in these codes rather than relying on precedent. They are not bound by the decisions of other courts in similar cases, which means that each case is considered independently of previous rulings. This difference in approach affects how disputes are resolved in courts, as common-law systems allow for more flexibility and adaptability in the interpretation of laws, while civil-law systems tend to be more rigid and rule-based."

Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR §§ \n1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR § 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired. \n \nIII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n37 \nForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well-\nbeing is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor \nstandard. We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2.

What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies.

These factors include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or merely offensive utterances, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. Psychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, but no single factor is required. The court emphasized that the effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive, but it is not a necessary condition for a hostile work environment claim under Title VII."

                    "question": "Why did the Supreme Court reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc., and what does this reversal imply about the legal standards for sexual harassment claims under Title VII?",
                    "answer": "The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Harris v. Forklift Systems Inc. because the lower court incorrectly applied standards that required proof of severe psychological injury for a sexual harassment claim under Title VII. The reversal implies that an employee need not prove severe psychological injury to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim. The court held that the environment must be perceived as hostile or abusive, and psychological harm is relevant but not required. This decision suggests that the legal standards for sexual harassment claims under Title VII are more flexible and focused on the overall perception of the work environment rather than requiring specific levels of psychological trauma."

                    "answer": "Stare decisis is a principle in common-law legal tradition that means 'to stand by things decided.' It emphasizes the importance of adhering to precedents set by previous court decisions. This principle is fundamental to common-law legal tradition because it ensures consistency and predictability in the law. Judges rely on past decisions to guide their rulings in similar cases, thereby maintaining stability and coherence in the legal system. When a judge follows stare decisis, she is essentially saying that the decision made in a previous case is binding and should be applied in a similar case unless there are compelling reasons to depart from it. This process helps in building a body of case law that serves as a guide for future cases and contributes to the development of the law over time."

If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values. If I like Daniel \nand try to convince you what a “good guy” he is, you may ask all sorts of questions: Is he good-\nlooking? Well-off? Fun to be with? Humorous? Athletic? Smart? I could answer all of those questions \nwith a yes, yet you would still not know any of his moral qualities. But if I said that he was honest, \ncaring, forthright, and diligent, volunteered in local soup kitchens, or tithed to the church, many \npeople would see Daniel as having certain ethical or moral qualities. If I said that he keeps the \nGolden Rule as well as anyone I know, you could conclude that he is an ethical person. But if I said \nthat he is “always in control” or “always at the top of his game,” you would probably not make \ninferences or assumptions about his character or ethics. \n \nThere are three key points here: \n \n1. Although morals and ethics are not precisely measurable, people generally have similar reactions \nabout what actions or conduct can rightly be called ethical or moral. \n2. As humans, we need and value ethical people and want to be around them. \n3. Saying that someone or some organization is law-abiding does not mean the same as saying a \nperson or company is ethical. \n \nHere is a cautionary note: for individuals, it is far from easy to recognize an ethical problem, have a \nclear and usable decision-making process to deal it, and then have the moral courage to do what’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n45 \nright. All of that is even more difficult within a business organization, where corporate employees \nvary in their motivations, loyalties, commitments, and character. There is no universally accepted \nway for developing an organization where employees feel valued, respected, and free to openly \ndisagree; where the actions of top management are crystal clear; and where all the employees feel \nloyal and accountable to one another. \n \nBefore talking about how ethics relates to law, we can conclude that ethics is the study of morality—\n“right” and “wrong”—in the context of everyday life, organizational behaviors, and even how society \noperates and is governed. \n \nHow Do Law and Ethics Differ? \nThere is a difference between legal compliance and moral excellence. Few would choose a professional \nservice, health care or otherwise, because the provider had a record of perfect legal compliance, or always \nfollowing the letter of the law. There are many professional ethics codes, primarily because people realize \nthat law prescribes only a minimum of morality and does not provide purpose or goals that can mean \nexcellent service to customers, clients, or patients. \nBusiness ethicists have talked for years about the intersection of law and ethics. Simply put, what is legal \nis not necessarily ethical. Conversely, what is ethical is not necessarily legal. There are lots of legal \nmaneuvers that are not all that ethical; the well-used phrase “legal loophole” suggests as much. \n \nHere are two propositions about business and ethics. Consider whether they strike you as true or whether \nyou would need to know more in order to make a judgment. \n \n• \nIndividuals and organizations have reputations. (For an individual, moral reputation is most \noften tied to others’ perceptions of his or her character: is the individual honest, diligent, reliable, \nfair, and caring? The reputation of an organization is built on the goodwill that suppliers, \ncustomers, the community, and employees feel toward it. Although an organization is not a \nperson in the usual sense, the goodwill that people feel about the organization is based on their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n46 \nperception of its better qualities by a variety of stakeholders: customers or clients, suppliers, \ninvestors, employees, government officials). \n• \nThe goodwill of an organization is to a great extent based on the actions it takes and on whether \nthe actions are favorably viewed. (This goodwill is usually specifically counted in the sale of a \nbusiness as an asset that the buyer pays for. While it is difficult to place a monetary value on \ngoodwill, a firm’s good reputation will generally call for a higher evaluation in the final accounting \nbefore the sale.

                    "answer": "Being law-abiding means adhering to the legal requirements and regulations set by the governing bodies. However, being ethical goes beyond just following the law; it involves making decisions based on moral principles and values. For example, an organization might follow all legal requirements but engage in unethical practices such as misleading advertising or exploiting workers. Similarly, an individual might comply with the law but act in ways that are morally questionable, such as cheating on a test or lying to a friend. This distinction is crucial in both personal and organizational contexts because it emphasizes the importance of ethical behavior over mere legal compliance. Ethical behavior ensures that actions are not just lawful but also align with societal values and principles, fostering trust, integrity, and positive relationships."

Legal troubles or a reputation for having legal troubles will only lessen the price \nfor a business and will even lessen the value of the company’s stock as bad legal news comes to the \npublic’s attention.) \n \nAnother reason to think about ethics in connection with law is that the laws themselves are meant to \nexpress some moral view. If there are legal prohibitions against cheating the Medicare program, it is \nbecause people (legislators or their agents) have collectively decided that cheating Medicare is wrong. If \nthere are legal prohibitions against assisting someone to commit suicide, it is because there has been a \ngroup decision that doing so is immoral. Thus the law provides some important cues as to what society \nregards as right or wrong. \nFinally, important policy issues that face society are often resolved through law, but it is important to \nunderstand the moral perspectives that underlie public debate—as, for example, in the continuing \ncontroversies over stem-cell research, medical use of marijuana, and abortion. Some ethical perspectives \nfocus on rights, some on social utility, some on virtue or character, and some on social justice. People \nconsciously (or, more often, unconsciously) adopt one or more of these perspectives, and even if they \ncompletely agree on the facts with an opponent, they will not change their views. Fundamentally, the \ndifference comes down to incompatible moral perspectives, a clash of basic values. These are hot-button \nissues because society is divided, not so much over facts, but over basic values. Understanding the varied \nmoral perspectives and values in public policy debates is a clarifying benefit in following or participating \nin these important discussions. \n \nWhy Should an Individual or a Business Entity Be Ethical? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n47 \nThe usual answer is that good ethics is good business. In the long run, businesses that pay attention to \nethics as well as law do better; they are viewed more favorably by customers. But this is a difficult claim to \nmeasure scientifically, because “the long run” is an indistinct period of time and because there are as yet \nno generally accepted criteria by which ethical excellence can be measured. In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made. The CEO told one group of \nbusiness ethicists that the uproar had taken them by surprise; they thought they had done everything \nright, but it seemed there was a “ghost in the machine.” That ghost was consumers, NGOs, and the media, \nall of whom objected to the company’s seeming lack of moral sensitivity. \nThe market does respond to unethical behavior. In Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate Governance\", \nyou will read about the Sears Auto Centers case. The loss of goodwill toward Sears Auto Centers was real, \neven though the total amount of money lost cannot be clearly accounted for. Years later, there are people \nwho will not go near a Sears Auto Center; the customers who lost trust in the company will never return, \nand many of their children may avoid Sears Auto Centers as well. \n \nThe Arthur Andersen story is even more dramatic. A major accounting firm, Andersen worked closely \nwith Enron in hiding its various losses through creative accounting measures. Suspiciously, Andersen’s \nHouston office also did some shredding around the clock, appearing to cover up what it was doing for \nEnron. A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late. Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who",

Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society, \nbelieving that the government should play that role. Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni. Etzioni was a founder of the \nCommunitarian Network, which is a group of individuals who have come together to bolster the moral,",

                    "answer": "The ethical implications of a company discharging pollutants into a river, even when such actions are not illegal, are complex and multifaceted. Ethical theories like utilitarianism would consider the overall consequences of the company's actions, including the harm caused to the ecosystem and human health, versus the benefits to the company's bottom line. If the pollution adversely affects fish populations and potentially drinking water supplies for downstream municipalities, utilitarian thinking would likely view such actions as unethical because they cause significant harm to others. From a deontological standpoint, Kantian ethics would argue that it is inherently wrong to engage in actions that treat people merely as means to an end, rather than as ends in themselves. Therefore, even if the company is not breaking any specific laws, the act of polluting could be considered unethical if it violates the principles of treating individuals as ends rather than as mere tools for profit. Additionally, from a stakeholder perspective, the company has a duty to consider the well-being of all stakeholders, not just shareholders, and the potential harm to the community and environment suggests that the company is failing to fulfill its responsibilities."

                    "answer": "Milton Friedman, a proponent of free-market capitalism, argued that the primary responsibility of a CEO and the board of a company is to maximize shareholder wealth. This perspective aligns with the statement that 'the business of business is business,' emphasizing that companies should focus on their core mission of generating profits and wealth for shareholders. However, the concept of conscious capitalism advocates for a broader view where companies consider the interconnected needs and desires of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the broader community. Under conscious capitalism, the CEO and the board are expected to pursue not only financial success but also social and environmental goals that align with the company's higher purposes. This approach suggests that while maximizing shareholder value remains important, it should not come at the expense of ethical behavior or the well-being of other stakeholders. Conscious capitalism posits that by harmonizing the interests of various stakeholders, companies can achieve long-term sustainability and success, whereas Friedman's view prioritizes short-term financial performance and shareholder returns."

Audi \nHarry and Kay Robinson purchased a new Audi automobile from Seaway Volkswagen, Inc. (Seaway), in \nMassena, New York, in 1976. The following year the Robinson family, who resided in New York, left that \nstate for a new home in Arizona. As they passed through Oklahoma, another car struck their Audi in the \nrear, causing a fire that severely burned Kay Robinson and her two children. Later on, the Robinsons \nbrought a products-liability action in the District Court for Creek County, Oklahoma, claiming that their \ninjuries resulted from the defective design and placement of the Audi’s gas tank and fuel system. They \nsued numerous defendants, including the automobile’s manufacturer, Audi NSU Auto Union \nAktiengesellschaft (Audi); its importer, Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen); its regional \ndistributor, World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. (World-Wide); and its retail dealer, Seaway. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n82 \n \nShould the Robinsons bring their action in state court or in federal court?

Understand the different but complementary roles of state and federal court systems. \n2. Explain why it makes sense for some courts to hear and decide only certain kinds of cases. \n3. Describe the difference between a trial court and an appellate court. \n \n \nAlthough it is sometimes said that there are two separate court systems, the reality is more complex. \nThere are, in fact, fifty-two court systems: those of the fifty states, the local court system in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the federal court system. At the same time, these are not entirely separate; \nthey all have several points of contact. \n \nState and local courts must honor both federal law and the laws of the other states. First, state courts \nmust honor federal law where state laws are in conflict with federal laws (under the supremacy \nclause of the Constitution; see Chapter 4 \"Constitutional Law and US Commerce\"). Second, claims \narising under federal statutes can often be tried in the state courts, where the Constitution or \nCongress has not explicitly required that only federal courts can hear that kind of claim. Third, under \nthe full faith and credit clause, each state court is obligated to respect the final judgments of courts in \nother states. Thus a contract dispute resolved by an Arkansas court cannot be relitigated in North \nDakota when the plaintiff wants to collect on the Arkansas judgment in North Dakota. Fourth, state \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n83 \ncourts often must consider the laws of other states in deciding cases involving issues where two \nstates have an interest, such as when drivers from two different states collide in a third state.

Additionally, the court's ability to exercise personal jurisdiction over all defendants would be crucial, meaning that the defendants must have sufficient contacts with Oklahoma to justify the court exercising jurisdiction over them.

State courts primarily deal with cases arising from state laws and regulations, whereas federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving federal law, disputes between states, and certain civil rights violations. These court systems are interconnected through several mechanisms. State courts must adhere to federal law when state laws conflict with federal ones (supremacy clause). Claims under federal statutes can often be heard in state courts unless the Constitution or Congress specifically mandates federal jurisdiction. Furthermore, state courts are bound by the full faith and credit clause to recognize and enforce the judgments of other states. When state courts need to consider laws from other states, they may refer to previous case decisions involving similar conflicts of laws. This interplay ensures that the legal system remains coherent and consistent across different jurisdictions within the United States."

If it’s a case based on state law, a state court will always have \nsubject matter jurisdiction. \n3 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case that is either based on a federal law \n(statute, case, or US Constitution) \nOR \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n95 \nA federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction over any case based on state law where the parties \nare (1) from different states and (2) the amount in controversy is at least $75,000. \n(1) The different states requirement means that no plaintiff can have permanent residence in a state \nwhere any defendant has permanent residence—there must be complete diversity of citizenship as \nbetween all plaintiffs and defendants. \n(2) The amount in controversy requirement means that a good-faith estimate of the amount the \nplaintiff may recover is at least $75,000. \nNOTE: For purposes of permanent residence, a corporation is considered a resident where it is \nincorporated AND where it has a principal place of business. \n4 \nIn diversity cases, the following rules apply. \n(1) Federal civil procedure rules apply to how the case is conducted before and during trial \nand any appeals, but \n(2) State law will be used as the basis for a determination of legal rights and responsibilities. \n(a) This “choice of law” process is interesting but complicated. Basically, each state has \nits own set of judicial decisions that resolve conflict of laws. For example, just because \nA sues B in a Texas court, the Texas court will not necessarily apply Texas law. Anna \nand Bobby collide and suffer serious physical injuries while driving their cars in \nRoswell, New Mexico. Both live in Austin, and Bobby files a lawsuit in Austin. The \ncourt there could hear it (having subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction \nover Bobby) but would apply New Mexico law, which governs motor vehicle laws and \naccidents in New Mexico. Why would the Texas judge do that? \n(b) The Texas judge knows that which state’s law is chosen to apply to the case can make \na decisive difference in the case, as different states have different substantive law \nstandards. For example, in a breach of contract case, one state’s version of the \nUniform Commercial Code may be different from another’s, and which one the court \ndecides to apply is often exceedingly good for one side and dismal for the other. \nIn Anna v. Bobby, if Texas has one kind of comparative negligence statute and New \nMexico has a different kind of comparative negligence statute, who wins or loses, or \nhow much is awarded, could well depend on which law applies. Because both were \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n96 \nunder the jurisdiction of New Mexico’s laws at the time, it makes sense to apply New \nMexico law. \n(3) Why do some nonresident defendants prefer to be in federal court? \n(a) In the state court, the judge is elected, and the jury may be familiar with or \nsympathetic to the “local” plaintiff. \n(b) The federal court provides a more neutral forum, with an appointed, life-tenured \njudge and a wider pool of potential jurors (drawn from a wider geographical area). \n(4) If a defendant does not want to be in state court and there is diversity, what is to be done? \n(a) Make a motion for removal to the federal court. \n(b) The federal court will not want to add to its caseload, or docket, but must take the \ncase unless there is not complete diversity of citizenship or the amount in controversy \nis less than $75,000. \n \n \nTo better understand subject matter jurisdiction in action, let’s take an example. Wile E. Coyote wants a \nfederal judge to hear his products-liability action against Acme, Inc., even though the action is based on \nstate law. Mr. Coyote’s attorney wants to “make a federal case” out of it, thinking that the jurors in the \nfederal district court’s jury pool will understand the case better and be more likely to deliver a “high value” \nverdict for Mr. Coyote. Mr. Coyote resides in Arizona, and Acme is incorporated in the state of Delaware \nand has its principal place of business in Chicago, Illinois. The federal court in Arizona can hear and \ndecide Mr. Coyote’s case (i.e., it has subject matter jurisdiction over the case) because of diversity of \ncitizenship. If Mr. Coyote was injured by one of Acme’s defective products while chasing a roadrunner in \nArizona, the federal district court judge would hear his action—using federal procedural law—and decide \nthe case based on the substantive law of Arizona on product liability. \n \nBut now change the facts only slightly: Acme is incorporated in Delaware but has its principal place of",

In Section 3.8 \"Alternative Means of \nResolving Disputes\", we will discuss other dispute-resolution forums, such as arbitration and mediation. \nFor now, let us consider how courts make decisions in civil disputes. Judicial decision making in the \ncontext of litigation (civil lawsuits) is a distinctive form of dispute resolution. \n \nFirst, to get the attention of a court, the plaintiff must make a claim based on existing laws. Second, courts \ndo not reach out for cases. Cases are brought to them, usually when an attorney files a case with the right \ncourt in the right way, following the various laws that govern all civil procedures in a state or in the federal \nsystem. (Most US states’ procedural laws are similar to the federal procedural code.) \n \nOnce at the court, the case will proceed through various motions (motions to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction, for example, or insufficient service of process), the proofs (submission of evidence), and the \narguments (debate about the meaning of the evidence and the law) of contesting parties. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n99 \nThis is at the heart of the adversary system, in which those who oppose each other may attack the other’s \ncase through proofs and cross-examination. Every person in the United States who wishes to take a case \nto court is entitled to hire a lawyer. The lawyer works for his client, not the court, and serves him as an \nadvocate, or supporter. The client’s goal is to persuade the court of the accuracy and justness of his \nposition. The lawyer’s duty is to shape the evidence and the argument—the line of reasoning about the \nevidence—to advance his client’s cause and persuade the court of its rightness. The lawyer for the \nopposing party will be doing the same thing, of course, for her client. The judge (or, if one is sitting, the \njury) must sort out the facts and reach a decision from this cross-fire of evidence and argument. \n \nThe method of adjudication—the act of making an order or judgment—has several important features. \nFirst, it focuses the conflicting issues. Other, secondary concerns are minimized or excluded altogether. \nRelevance is a key concept in any trial. The judge is required to decide the questions presented at the trial, \nnot to talk about related matters. Second, adjudication requires that the judge’s decision be reasoned, and \nthat is why judges write opinions explaining their decisions (an opinion may be omitted when the verdict \ncomes from a jury). Third, the judge’s decision must not only be reasoned but also be responsive to the \ncase presented: the judge is not free to say that the case is unimportant and that he therefore will ignore it. \nUnlike other branches of government that are free to ignore problems pressing upon them, judges must \ndecide cases. (For example, a legislature need not enact a law, no matter how many people petition it to do \nso.) Fourth, the court must respond in a certain way. The judge must pay attention to the parties’ \narguments and his decision must result from their proofs and arguments. Evidence that is not presented \nand legal arguments that are not made cannot be the basis for what the judge decides. Also, judges are \nbound by standards of weighing evidence: the burden of proof in a civil case is generally a “preponderance \nof the evidence.” \n \nIn all cases, the plaintiff—the party making a claim and initiating the lawsuit (in a criminal case the \nplaintiff is the prosecution)—has the burden of proving his case. If he fails to prove it, the defendant—the \nparty being sued or prosecuted—will win. \nCriminal prosecutions carry the most rigorous burden of proof: the government must prove its case \nagainst the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, even if it seems very likely that the defendant \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n100 \ncommitted the crime, as long as there remains some reasonable doubt—perhaps he was not clearly \nidentified as the culprit, perhaps he has an alibi that could be legitimate—the jury must vote to acquit \nrather than convict. \n \nBy contrast, the burden of proof in ordinary civil cases—those dealing with contracts, personal injuries, \nand most of the cases in this book—is a preponderance of the evidence, which means that the plaintiff’s \nevidence must outweigh whatever evidence the defendant can muster that casts doubts on the plaintiff’s \nclaim. This is not merely a matter of counting the number of witnesses or of the length of time that they \ntalk: the judge in a trial without a jury (a bench trial), or the jury where one is impaneled, must apply the \npreponderance of evidence test by determining which side has the greater weight of credible, relevant \nevidence. \n \nAdjudication and the adversary system imply certain other characteristics of courts.

Unless the defendant had some significant contact with the plaintiff’s state, the plaintiff may \nindeed have to. For instance, suppose a traveler from Maine stopped at a roadside diner in Montana and \nordered a slice of homemade pie that was tainted and caused him to be sick. The traveler may not simply \nreturn home and mail the diner a notice that he is suing it in a Maine court. But if out-of-state defendants \nhave some contact with the plaintiff’s state of residence, there might be grounds to bring them within the \njurisdiction of the plaintiff’s state courts. In Burger King v. Rudzewicz, Section 3.9 \"Cases\", the federal \ncourt in Florida had to consider whether it was constitutionally permissible to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a Michigan franchisee. \n \nAgain, recall that even if a court has subject matter jurisdiction, it must also have personal jurisdiction \nover each defendant against whom an enforceable judgment can be made. Often this is not a problem; you \nmight be suing a person who lives in your state or regularly does business in your state. Or a nonresident \nmay answer your complaint without objecting to the court’s “in personam” (personal) jurisdiction. But \nmany defendants who do not reside in the state where the lawsuit is filed would rather not be put to the \ninconvenience of contesting a lawsuit in a distant forum. Fairness—and the due process clause of the \nFourteenth Amendment—dictates that nonresidents should not be required to defend lawsuits far from \ntheir home base, especially where there is little or no contact or connection between the nonresident and \nthe state where a lawsuit is brought. \n \nSummary of Rules on Personal Jurisdiction \n1. \nOnce a court determines that it has subject matter jurisdiction, it must find at least one defendant \nover which it is “fair” (i.e., in accord with due process) to exercise personal jurisdiction. \n2. If a plaintiff sues five defendants and the court has personal jurisdiction over just one, the case \ncan be heard, but the court cannot make a judgment against the other four. \n1. \nBut if the plaintiff loses against defendant 1, he can go elsewhere (to another state or \nstates) and sue defendants 2, 3, 4, or 5. \n2. The court’s decision in the first lawsuit (against defendant 1) does not determine the \nliability of the nonparticipating defendants. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n103 \nThis involves the principle of res judicata, which means that you can’t bring the same action \nagainst the same person (or entity) twice. It’s like the civil side of double jeopardy. Res means \n“thing,” and judicata means “adjudicated.” Thus the “thing” has been “adjudicated” and \nshould not be judged again. But, as to nonparticipating parties, it is not over. If you have \na different case against the same defendant—one that arises out of a completely different \nsituation—that case is not barred by res judicata. \n3. Service of process is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for getting personal jurisdiction \nover a particular defendant (see rule 4). \n1. \nIn order to get a judgment in a civil action, the plaintiff must serve a copy of the \ncomplaint and a summons on the defendant. \n2. There are many ways to do this. \n• \nThe process server personally serves a complaint on the defendant. \n• \nThe process server leaves a copy of the summons and complaint at the residence \nof the defendant, in the hands of a competent person. \n• \nThe process server sends the summons and complaint by certified mail, return \nreceipt requested. \n• \nThe process server, if all other means are not possible, notifies the defendant by \npublication in a newspaper having a minimum number of readers (as may be \nspecified by law). \n4. In addition to successfully serving the defendant with process, a plaintiff must convince the court \nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is consistent with due process and any \nstatutes in that state that prescribe the jurisdictional reach of that state (the so-called long-arm \nstatutes). The Supreme Court has long recognized various bases for judging whether such process \nis fair. \n1. \nConsent. The defendant agrees to the court’s jurisdiction by coming to court, answering \nthe complaint, and having the matter litigated there. \n2. Domicile. The defendant is a permanent resident of that state. \n3. Event. The defendant did something in that state, related to the lawsuit, that makes it fair \nfor the state to say, “Come back and defend!” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n104 \n4. Service of process within the state will effectively provide personal jurisdiction over the \nnonresident. \n \nAgain, let’s consider Mrs. Robinson and her children in the Audi accident.

However, if the defendant has some contact with the plaintiff's state, there might be grounds to bring the case to the plaintiff's state court. For instance, in Burger King v.

                    "answer": "Res judicata is a legal doctrine that means 'thing adjudicated,' indicating that once a case has been fully and finally decided on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, the same cause of action cannot be re-litigated between the same parties or their privies. This principle prevents the same parties from relitigating the same claim in different forums. In the context of nonparticipating defendants, res judicata does not bar new claims against those who were not parties to the initial lawsuit, provided these new claims arise out of a different situation. Therefore, if the plaintiff loses against one defendant, they can still pursue other defendants in different states, as the previous case does not determine the liability of nonparticipating defendants."

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s",

                    "answer": "Mrs. Harris's lawsuit would be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that plaintiffs must first exhaust administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and receiving a right-to-sue letter before they can bring a lawsuit in federal court.

            "chunk": "lawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause. For \nexample, in the Robinsons’ case against Audi, the attorneys representing Audi will want to know if any \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n112 \nprospective jurors have ever owned an Audi, what their experience has been, and if they had a similar \nproblem (or worse) with their Audi that was not resolved to their satisfaction. If so, the defense attorney \ncould well believe that such a juror has a potential for a bias against her client. In that case, she could use \na challenge for cause, explaining to the judge the basis for her challenge. The judge, at her discretion, \ncould either accept the for-cause reason or reject it. \n \nEven if an attorney cannot articulate a for-cause reason acceptable to the judge, he may use one of several \nperemptory challenges that most states (and the federal system) allow. A trial attorney with many years of \nexperience may have a sixth sense about a potential juror and, in consultation with the client, may decide \nto use a peremptory challenge to avoid having that juror on the panel. \n \nAfter the jury is sworn and seated, the plaintiff’s lawyer makes an opening statement, laying out the \nnature of the plaintiff’s claim, the facts of the case as the plaintiff sees them, and the evidence that the \nlawyer will present. The defendant’s lawyer may also make an opening statement or may reserve his right \nto do so at the end of the plaintiff’s case. \n \nThe plaintiff’s lawyer then calls witnesses and presents the physical evidence that is relevant to her proof. \nThe direct testimony at trial is usually far from a smooth narration. The rules of evidence (that govern the \nkinds of testimony and documents that may be introduced at trial) and the question-and-answer format \ntend to make the presentation of evidence choppy and difficult to follow. \n \nAnyone who has watched an actual televised trial or a television melodrama featuring a trial scene will \nappreciate the nature of the trial itself: witnesses are asked questions about a number of issues that may \nor may not be related, the opposing lawyer will frequently object to the question or the form in which it is \nasked, and the jury may be sent from the room while the lawyers argue at the bench before the judge. \n \nAfter direct testimony of each witness is over, the opposing lawyer may conduct cross-examination. This \nis a crucial constitutional right; in criminal cases it is preserved in the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment \n(the right to confront one’s accusers in open court). The formal rules of direct testimony are then relaxed, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n113 \nand the cross-examiner may probe the witness more informally, asking questions that may not seem \nimmediately relevant. This is when the opposing attorney may become harsh, casting doubt on a witness’s \ncredibility, trying to trip her up and show that the answers she gave are false or not to be trusted. This use \nof cross-examination, along with the requirement that the witness must respond to questions that are at \nall relevant to the questions raised by the case, distinguishes common-law courts from those of \nauthoritarian regimes around the world. \n \nFollowing cross-examination, the plaintiff’s lawyer may then question the witness again: this is called \nredirect examination and is used to demonstrate that the witness’s original answers were accurate and to \nshow that any implications otherwise, suggested by the cross-examiner, were unwarranted. The cross-\nexaminer may then engage the witness in re-cross-examination, and so on. The process usually stops after \ncross-examination or redirect. \n \nDuring the trial, the judge’s chief responsibility is to see that the trial is fair to both sides. One big piece of \nthat responsibility is to rule on the admissibility of evidence. A judge may rule that a particular question is \nout of order—that is, not relevant or appropriate—or that a given document is irrelevant. Where the \nattorney is convinced that a particular witness, a particular question, or a particular document (or part \nthereof) is critical to her case, she may preserve an objection to the court’s ruling by saying “exception,” in \nwhich case the court stenographer will note the exception; on appeal, the attorney may cite any number of \nexceptions as adding up to the lack of a fair trial for her client and may request a court of appeals to order \na retrial.",

Juries just announce their verdicts and do not state their reasons for reaching them.) \n \nPosttrial Motions \nThe losing party is allowed to ask the judge for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict \n(often called a judgment n.o.v., from the Latin non obstante veredicto). A judge who decides that a \ndirected verdict is appropriate will usually wait to see what the jury’s verdict is. If it is favorable to the \nparty the judge thinks should win, she can rely on that verdict. If the verdict is for the other party, he can \ngrant the motion for judgment n.o.v. This is a safer way to proceed because if the judge is reversed on \nappeal, a new trial is not necessary. The jury’s verdict always can be restored, whereas without a jury \nverdict (as happens when a directed verdict is granted before the case goes to the jury), the entire case \nmust be presented to a new jury. Ferlito v. Johnson & Johnson (Section 3.9 \"Cases\") illustrates the \njudgment n.o.v. process in a case where the judge allowed the case to go to a jury that was overly \nsympathetic to the plaintiffs. \nRule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the authorization for federal judges making a \njudgment contrary to the judgment of the jury. Most states have a similar rule. \n \nRule 50(b) says, \nWhenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any \nreason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a \nlater determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Not later than 10 days after entry \nof judgment, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any \njudgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party’s \nmotion for a directed verdict.…[A] new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n116 \nreturned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either \norder a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe purpose of a trial judge is to ensure justice to all parties to the lawsuit. The judge presides, instructs the \njury, and may limit who testifies and what they testify about what. In all of this, the judge will usually commit \nsome errors; occasionally these will be the kinds of errors that seriously compromise a fair trial for both \nparties. Errors that do seriously compromise a fair trial for both parties are prejudicial, as opposed to \nharmless. The appeals court must decide whether any errors of the trial court judge are prejudicial or not. \nIf a judge directs a verdict, that ends the case for the party who hasn’t asked for one; if a judge grants \njudgment n.o.v., that will take away a jury verdict that one side has worked very hard to get. Thus a judge \nmust be careful not to unduly favor one side or the other, regardless of his or her sympathies. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What if there was not a doctrine of res judicata? What would the legal system be like? \n2. Why do you think cross-examination is a “right,” as opposed to a “good thing”?

Understand the posttrial process—how appellate courts process appeals. \n2. Explain how a court’s judgment is translated into relief for the winning party. \n \n \nJudgment or Order \nAt the end of a trial, the judge will enter an order that makes findings of fact (often with the help of a jury) \nand conclusions of law. The judge will also make a judgment as to what relief or remedy should be given. \nOften it is an award of money damages to one of the parties. The losing party may ask for a new trial at \nthis point or within a short period of time following. Once the trial judge denies any such request, the \njudgment—in the form of the court’s order—is final. \n \nAppeal \nIf the loser’s motion for a new trial or a judgment n.o.v. is denied, the losing party may appeal but must \nordinarily post a bond sufficient to ensure that there are funds to pay the amount awarded to the winning \nparty. In an appeal, the appellant aims to show that there was some prejudicial error committed by the \ntrial judge. There will be errors, of course, but the errors must be significant (i.e., not harmless). The basic \nidea is for an appellate court to ensure that a reasonably fair trial was provided to both sides. Enforcement \nof the court’s judgment—an award of money, an injunction—is usually stayed (postponed) until the \nappellate court has ruled. As noted earlier, the party making the appeal is called the appellant, and the \nparty defending the judgment is the appellee (or in some courts, the petitioner and the respondent). \n \nDuring the trial, the losing party may have objected to certain procedural decisions by the judge.

On the other hand, if a judge grants a judgment n.o.v., it overturns a jury verdict that the losing party has likely worked hard to achieve. In both cases, the losing party still retains the option to request a new trial or appeal the decision. However, granting a judgment n.o.v. removes the possibility of a jury's verdict, meaning the entire case must be presented to a new jury if the losing party ultimately prevails on appeal.

The mediator is a \ngo-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution. The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes.

Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s \naffiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of \nmodern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire \ncommunications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which \nbusiness is conducted. So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are “purposefully directed” toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an absence of physical contacts can defeat \npersonal jurisdiction there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n133 \n \nOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum \nState, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of \npersonal jurisdiction would comport with “fair play and substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S., at 320. Thus courts in “appropriate case[s]” may evaluate “the burden on the \ndefendant,” “the forum State’s interest in adjudicating the dispute,” “the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief,” “the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient \nresolution of controversies,” and the “shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of \njurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required. [Citations] \nApplying these principles to the case at hand, we believe there is substantial record evidence supporting \nthe District Court’s conclusion that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over Rudzewicz in Florida for the \nalleged breach of his franchise agreement did not offend due process.… \n \nIn this case, no physical ties to Florida can be attributed to Rudzewicz other than MacShara’s brief \ntraining course in Miami.

                    "answer": "The 'purposeful availment' requirement ensures that a defendant will not be subject to personal jurisdiction in a forum solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts, or of the unilateral activity of another party or a third person. This principle is crucial because it aligns with the idea that a defendant should have 'purposefully established minimum contacts' within the forum state. When a defendant's actions create a 'substantial connection' with the forum state, such as engaging in significant activities within the state or creating ongoing obligations with residents of the forum, they are deemed to have availed themselves of the benefits and protections of the forum's laws. This means that it is reasonable to require the defendant to submit to the burdens of litigation in that forum. Importantly, the requirement of 'purposeful availment' ensures that jurisdiction is not imposed merely because the defendant did not physically enter the forum state, as long as their efforts are 'purposefully directed' towards residents of the forum."

Mrs. Ferlito had constructed a lamb costume for her \nhusband by gluing cotton batting manufactured by defendant Johnson & Johnson Products (“JJP”) to a \nsuit of long underwear. She had also used defendant’s product to fashion a headpiece, complete with ears. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n135 \nThe costume covered Mr. Ferlito from his head to his ankles, except for his face and hands, which were \nblackened with Halloween paint. At the party Mr. Ferlito attempted to light his cigarette by using a butane \nlighter. The flame passed close to his left arm, and the cotton batting on his left sleeve ignited. Plaintiffs \nsued defendant for injuries they suffered from burns which covered approximately one-third of Mr. \nFerlito’s body. \n \nFollowing a jury verdict entered for plaintiffs November 2, 1989, the Honorable Ralph M. Freeman \nentered a judgment for plaintiff Frank Ferlito in the amount of $555,000 and for plaintiff Susan Ferlito in \nthe amount of $ 70,000. Judgment was entered November 7, 1989.

United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of \nlotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n148 \nfood and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement \nin prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] \n \nIn each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary \nto the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate \ntransportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of \ninterstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed!

The Court's rationale was that if Congress could take away the facilitation of interstate transportation for less noble purposes, it could also do so for more noble ones. However, in Hammer v.

It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political \ncandidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of \nthose candidates. Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action. Your \nemployer or any private enterprise is not bound by constitutional limits. For example, if drug testing of all \nemployees every week is done by government agency, the employees may have a cause of action to object \nbased on the Fourth Amendment.

Connecticut \n381 U.S. 479 (U.S. Supreme Court 1965) \n \nA nineteenth-century Connecticut law made the use, possession, or distribution of birth control devices \nillegal. The law also prohibited anyone from giving information about such devices. The executive \ndirector and medical director of a planned parenthood association were found guilty of giving out such \ninformation to a married couple that wished to delay having children for a few years. The directors \nwere fined $100 each. \n \nThey appealed throughout the Connecticut state court system, arguing that the state law violated \n(infringed) a basic or fundamental right of privacy of a married couple: to live together and have sex \ntogether without the restraining power of the state to tell them they may legally have intercourse but \nnot if they use condoms or other birth control devices. At each level (trial court, court of appeals, and \nConnecticut Supreme Court), the Connecticut courts upheld the constitutionality of the convictions. \n \nPlurality Opinion by Justice William O. Douglass \n \nWe do not sit as a super legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch \neconomic problems, business affairs, or social conditions. The [Connecticut] law, however, operates \ndirectly on intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician’s role in one aspect of that relation. \n \n[Previous] cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by \nemanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.…Various guarantees create \nzones of privacy. The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one.…The \nThird Amendment in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers “in any house” in time of peace \nwithout the consent of the owner is another facet of that privacy.  \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n175 \nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the “right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, \npapers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” The Fifth Amendment in its Self-\nIncrimination Clause enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which the government may not force \nhim to surrender to his detriment. The Ninth Amendment provides: “The enumeration in the \nConstitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” \n \nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described…as protection against all governmental invasions “of \nthe sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life.” We recently referred in Mapp v. Ohio…to the \nFourth Amendment as creating a “right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and \nparticularly reserved to the people.” \n \n[The law in question here], in forbidding the use of contraceptives rather than regulating their \nmanufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by having a maximum destructive impact on [the marital] \nrelationship. Such a law cannot stand.…Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of \nmarital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of \nprivacy surrounding the marital relationship. \n \nWe deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than \nour school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate \nto the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in \nliving, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for \nas noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions. \n \nMr. Justice Stewart, whom Mr. Justice Black joins, dissenting. \n \nSince 1879 Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone. I \nthink this is an uncommonly silly law. As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in \nthe oblique context of the present case. As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the \nrelationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual’s moral, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n176 \nethical, and religious beliefs. As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of \nbirth control should be available to all, so that each individual’s choice can be meaningfully made. But we \nare not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine. We are asked to hold \nthat it violates the United States Constitution. And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n…",

For that reason, \n“there is no valid safety reason for barring twins from Iowa’s highways because of their \nconfiguration.…The evidence convincingly, if not overwhelmingly, establishes that the 65-foot twin is as \nsafe as, if not safer than, the 60-foot twin and the 55-foot semi.…” \n \n“Twins and semis have different characteristics. Twins are more maneuverable, are less sensitive to wind, \nand create less splash and spray. However, they are more likely than semis to jackknife or upset. They can \nbe backed only for a short distance. The negative characteristics are not such that they render the twin less \nsafe than semis overall. Semis are more stable, but are more likely to ‘rear-end’ another vehicle.” \n \nIn light of these findings, the District Court applied the standard we enunciated in Raymond Motor \nTransportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U.S. 429 (1978), and concluded that the state law impermissibly \nburdened interstate commerce: “[T]he balance here must be struck in favor of the federal interests. \nThe total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight and \nproblematical that it does not outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from \ninterferences that seriously impede it.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n181 \nThe Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 612 F.2d 1064 (1979). It accepted the District Court’s \nfinding that 65-foot doubles were as safe as 55-foot singles. Id. at 1069. Thus, the only apparent safety \nbenefit to Iowa was that resulting from forcing large trucks to detour around the State, thereby reducing \noverall truck traffic on Iowa’s highways. The Court of Appeals noted that this was not a constitutionally \npermissible interest. It also commented that the several statutory exemptions identified above, such as \nthose applicable to border cities and the shipment of livestock, suggested that the law, in effect, benefited \nIowa residents at the expense of interstate traffic. Id. at 1070-1071. The combination of these exemptions \nweakened the presumption of validity normally accorded a state safety regulation. For these reasons, the \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Iowa statute unconstitutionally burdened \ninterstate commerce. \n \nIowa appealed, and we noted probable jurisdiction. 446 U.S. 950 (1980). We now affirm. \n \n \n \nII \nIt is unnecessary to review in detail the evolution of the principles of Commerce Clause adjudication. The \nClause is both a “prolific ‘ of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the \nstate[s].” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 336 U.S. 534 (1949). The Clause permits \nCongress to legislate when it perceives that the national welfare is not furthered by the independent \nactions of the States. It is now well established, also, that the Clause itself is “a limitation upon state power \neven without congressional implementation.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333 at 350 (1977). The Clause requires that some aspects of trade generally must remain free from \ninterference by the States. When a State ventures excessively into the regulation of these aspects of \ncommerce, it “trespasses upon national interests,” Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366, 424 U.S. \n373 (1976), and the courts will hold the state regulation invalid under the Clause alone. \n \nThe Commerce Clause does not, of course, invalidate all state restrictions on commerce. It has long been \nrecognized that, “in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n182 \nstate to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect \ninterstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.” Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local",

Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are \nnot illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison \nwith related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449.

Regulations designed for that salutary purpose nevertheless may further the \npurpose so marginally, and interfere with commerce so substantially, as to be invalid under the \nCommerce Clause. In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the \nState’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the \nasserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a \ncourt requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive \nconsideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden \nimposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id. at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., \n397 U.S. 137 at 142 (1970);Bibb, supra, at 359 U.S. at 525-530. \n \nIII \nApplying these general principles, we conclude that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally \nburden interstate commerce. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n183 \nIn Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections.

However, regulations designed to promote public health or safety can still be invalidated under the Commerce Clause if they further the purpose so marginally and interfere with commerce so substantially that they become invalid. In cases like Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court evaluates the evidence presented by the state to support the safety rationale of its law and compares it with the actual findings regarding the safety of the regulated practice. The Court also considers whether the state's law is out of step with other states' laws and if it imposes significant burdens on interstate commerce without a substantial safety benefit."

By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent.

Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision.

Understand why the Administrative Procedure Act was needed. \n2. Understand how hearings are conducted under the act. \n3. Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve? \n2. Why is ignorance of the law no excuse? Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be \ncomplicated and sometimes ambiguous? \n \n \n \n \n6.2 Types of Crimes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

                    "question": "What distinguishes a murder from other types of homicide under the law?",
                    "answer": "Under the law, a murder is distinguished from other types of homicide through the presence of 'malice aforethought,' which signifies that the perpetrator had the intent to kill. This intent does not necessarily have to be premeditated for a prolonged period; it can be spontaneous, such as during a heated argument that escalates into a fatal altercation. Additionally, a killing that occurs during the commission of a felony, regardless of the initial intent, can also be classified as murder due to the felony murder rule. This rule holds accomplices accountable, even those far removed from the actual act of killing, such as the driver of a getaway vehicle in an armed robbery where a fatal shooting occurs unexpectedly."

                    "question": "How does the felony murder rule impact the legal responsibility of individuals involved in a felony, especially those not directly involved in the killing?",
                    "answer": "The felony murder rule significantly expands legal responsibility by holding individuals accountable for the unintended deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if they were not directly involved in the killing. For instance, a driver in a getaway car could be charged with murder if a co-conspirator accidentally shoots and kills someone during the felony. This rule underscores the idea that engaging in dangerous criminal activities can carry severe consequences for all participants, not just those who directly cause the death. It serves as a deterrent to risky behavior and ensures that everyone involved in a felony faces potential criminal charges if a fatality results from their actions."

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

Factors contributing to determining if someone has committed larceny include the act of taking or carrying away the property, the intent to steal, and the nature of the property involved. For instance, if a person walking through an orchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, they are not guilty of larceny because they have not taken away personal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). Similarly, sneaking into a movie theater without paying is not considered larceny, even though it is a criminal act. Another example is the act of taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility, which was unclear if it constituted larceny in the past but is now clearly considered a form of theft under modern statutes."

Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law. In one case, a state governor was convicted of mail fraud when he took bribes to \ninfluence the setting of racing dates. The court’s theory was that he defrauded the citizenry of its right to \nhis “honest and faithful services” as governor.

For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

Explain how a corporation can be guilty of a crime, even though it is a corporation’s agents that commit the \ncrime. \n \n \nTo be guilty of a crime, you must have acted. Mental desire or intent to do so is insufficient. But what \nconstitutes an act? This question becomes important when someone begins to commit a crime, or \ndoes so in association with others, or intends to do one thing but winds up doing something else. \n \nAttempt \nIt is not necessary to commit the intended crime to be found guilty of a criminal offense. An attempt to \ncommit the crime is punishable as well, though usually not as severely. For example, Brett points a gun at \nAshley, intending to shoot her dead. He pulls the trigger but his aim is off, and he misses her heart by four \nfeet. He is guilty of an attempt to murder. Suppose, however, that earlier in the day, when he was \npreparing to shoot Ashley, Brett had been overheard in his apartment muttering to himself of his \nintention, and that a neighbor called the police. When they arrived, he was just snapping his gun into his \nshoulder holster. \n \nAt that point, courts in most states would not consider him guilty of an attempt because he had not passed \nbeyond the stage of preparation. After having buttoned his jacket he might have reconsidered and put the \ngun away. Determining when the accused has passed beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step \ntoward perpetrating the crime is often difficult and is usually for the jury to decide. \n \nImpossibility \nWhat if a defendant is accused of attempting a crime that is factually impossible? For example, suppose \nthat men believed they were raping a drunken, unconscious woman, and were later accused of attempted \nrape, but defended on the grounds of factual impossibility because the woman was actually dead at the \ntime sexual intercourse took place? Or suppose that a husband intended to poison his wife with \nstrychnine in her coffee, but put sugar in the coffee instead? The “mens rea” or criminal intent was there, \nbut the act itself was not criminal (rape requires a live victim, and murder by poisoning requires the use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n256 \npoison).

Courts generally consider whether the individual has taken substantial steps towards committing the crime, such as gathering materials or preparing to commit the act, before determining guilt. However, the determination of when a person has moved beyond mere preparation and taken an actual step towards committing the crime can be complex and is often left to the jury to decide. For instance, in the case where Brett points a gun at Ashley and pulls the trigger, missing her heart, he may be considered guilty of an attempt to murder. On the other hand, if Brett had only prepared to shoot Ashley and was caught before taking any action, he might not be considered guilty of an attempt."

The \npolice are permitted to use such techniques to detect criminal activity; they are not permitted to do so to \ninstigate crime. The distinction is usually made between a person who intends to commit a crime and one \nwho does not. If the police provide the former with an opportunity to commit a criminal act—the sale of \ndrugs to an undercover agent, for example—there is no defense of entrapment. But if the police knock on \nthe door of one not known to be a drug user and persist in a demand that he purchase drugs from them, \nfinally overcoming his will to resist, a conviction for purchase and possession of drugs can be overturned \non the ground of entrapment. \n \nOther Excuses \nA number of other circumstances can limit or excuse criminal liability. These include compulsion (a gun \npointed at one’s head by a masked man who apparently is unafraid to use the weapon and who demands \nthat you help him rob a store), honest consent of the “victim” (the quarterback who is tackled), adherence \nto the requirements of legitimate public authority lawfully exercised (a policeman directs a towing \ncompany to remove a car parked in a tow-away zone), the proper exercise of domestic authority (a parent \nmay spank a child, within limits), and defense of self, others, property, and habitation. Each of these \nexcuses is a complex subject in itself. \n \n \nLack of Capacity \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n261 \nA further defense to criminal prosecution is the lack of mental capacity to commit the crime. Infants and \nchildren are considered incapable of committing a crime; under common law any child under the age of \nseven could not be prosecuted for any act. That age of incapacity varies from state to state and is now \nusually defined by statutes. Likewise, insanity or mental disease or defect can be a complete defense. \nIntoxication can be a defense to certain crimes, but the mere fact of drunkenness is not ordinarily \nsufficient. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn the United States, some crimes can be committed by not following strict regulatory requirements for \nhealth, safety, or the environment. The law does provide excuses from criminal liability for mistakes of fact, \nentrapment, and lack of capacity. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Describe several situations in which compulsion, consent, or other excuses take away criminal liability. \n2. Your employee is drunk on the job and commits the crime of assault and battery on a customer. He claims \nlack of capacity as an excuse. Should the courts accept this excuse?

Describe the basic steps in pretrial criminal procedure that follow a government's determination to arrest \nsomeone for an alleged criminal act. \n2. Describe the basic elements of trial and posttrial criminal procedure. \n \n \nThe procedure for criminal prosecutions is complex. Procedures will vary from state to state. A \ncriminal case begins with an arrest if the defendant is caught in the act or fleeing from the scene; if \nthe defendant is not caught, a warrant for the defendant’s arrest will issue. The warrant is issued by a \njudge or a magistrate upon receiving a complaint detailing the charge of a specific crime against the \naccused. It is not enough for a police officer to go before a judge and say, “I’d like you to arrest \nBonnie because I think she’s just murdered Clyde.” She must supply enough information to satisfy \nthe magistrate that there is probable cause (reasonable grounds) to believe that the accused \ncommitted the crime. The warrant will be issued to any officer or agency that has power to arrest the \naccused with warrant in hand. \n \nThe accused will be brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing. The purpose of the \nhearing is to determine whether there is sufficient reason to hold the accused for trial. If so, the \naccused can be sent to jail or be permitted to make bail. Bail is a sum of money paid to the court to \nsecure the defendant’s attendance at trial. If he fails to appear, he forfeits the money. \nConstitutionally, bail can be withheld only if there is reason to believe that the accused will flee the \njurisdiction. \n \nOnce the arrest is made, the case is in the hands of the prosecutor.

The key difference lies in the intent behind the police actions. If the police provide an opportunity for someone to commit a crime, such as selling drugs to an undercover agent, there is no defense of entrapment because the individual was already predisposed to commit the crime. However, if the police persistently pressure a person who has no intention of committing the crime into doing so, this can constitute entrapment. For instance, if a police officer knocks on the door of a non-drug user and continues to demand that they purchase drugs, eventually overcoming their resistance, a conviction for purchasing and possessing drugs could be overturned on the grounds of entrapment. This distinction hinges on whether the individual had a pre-existing inclination towards criminal behavior or was coerced into it by the police."

The defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case will be tried \nbefore a jury (sometimes referred to as a petit jury). The jury cannot convict unless it finds the \ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \n \nThe defendant might have pleaded guilty to the offense or to a lesser charge (often referred to as a \n“lesser included offense”—simple larceny, for example, is a lesser included offense of robbery \nbecause the defendant may not have used violence but nevertheless stole from the victim). Such a \nplea is usually arranged through plea bargaining with the prosecution. In return for the plea, the \nprosecutor promises to recommend to the judge that the sentence be limited. The judge most often, \nbut not always, goes along with the prosecutor’s recommendation. \n \nThe defendant is also permitted to file a plea of nolo contendere (no contest) in prosecutions for \ncertain crimes. In so doing, he neither affirms nor denies his guilt. He may be sentenced as though he \nhad pleaded guilty, although usually a nolo plea is the result of a plea bargain. Why plead nolo? In \nsome offenses, such as violations of the antitrust laws, the statutes provide that private plaintiffs may \nuse a conviction or a guilty plea as proof that the defendant violated the law. This enables a plaintiff \nto prove liability without putting on witnesses or evidence and reduces the civil trial to a hearing \nabout the damages to plaintiff. The nolo plea permits the defendant to avoid this, so that any plaintiff \nwill have to not only prove damages but also establish civil liability. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n264 \nFollowing a guilty plea or a verdict of guilt, the judge will impose a sentence after presentencing \nreports are written by various court officials (often, probation officers). Permissible sentences are \nspelled out in statutes, though these frequently give the judge a range within which to work (e.g., \ntwenty years to life). The judge may sentence the defendant to imprisonment, a fine, or both, or may \ndecide to suspend sentence (i.e., the defendant will not have to serve the sentence as long as he stays \nout of trouble). \n \nSentencing usually comes before appeal. As in civil cases, the defendant, now convicted, has the right \nto take at least one appeal to higher courts, where issues of procedure and constitutional rights may \nbe argued. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCriminal procedure in US courts is designed to provide a fair process to both criminal defendants and to \nsociety. The grand jury system, prosecutorial discretion, plea bargains, and appeals for lack of a fair trial are all \npart of US criminal procedure. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

During this hearing, the magistrate evaluates the evidence presented by the prosecution to decide if the case against the accused is strong enough to proceed to trial. If the magistrate decides that there is probable cause to believe the accused committed the crime, the accused can be sent to jail or allowed to make bail.

Instead, it serves as a mechanism for reviewing the prosecution's case and deciding if the evidence is strong enough to support formal charges. The grand jury consists of twenty-three people who collectively assess the evidence presented by the prosecutor to decide whether to indict the accused. Once indicted, the accused formally becomes a defendant and will be arraigned, where they will be brought before a judge to answer the accusation in the indictment."

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country. Deciding what “commercial” or \n“trade” purposes are is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its \ncover without first obtaining written permission, but a chocolate manufacturer could not put the player’s \npicture on a candy wrapper without consent. \n \nPersonal Space \nOne form of intrusion upon a person’s solitude—trespass—has long been actionable under common law. \nPhysical invasion of home or other property is not a new tort. But in recent years, the notion of intrusion \nhas been broadened considerably. Now, taking photos of someone else with your cell phone in a locker \nroom could constitute invasion of the right to privacy. Reading someone else’s mail or e-mail could also \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n296 \nconstitute an invasion of the right to privacy. Photographing someone on a city street is not tortious, but \nsubsequent use of the photograph could be. Whether the invasion is in a public or private space, the \namount of damages will depend on how the image or information is disclosed to others. \n \nPublic Disclosure of Embarassing Facts \nCirculation of false statements that do injury to a person are actionable under the laws of defamation. \nWhat about true statements that might be every bit as damaging—for example, disclosure of someone’s \nincome tax return, revealing how much he earned? The general rule is that if the facts are truly private \nand of no “legitimate” concern to the public, then their disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy. But \na person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection. \n \nFalse Light \nA final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false, it might \nnot be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication \nmight even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is. Subject to the First \nAmendment requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or extreme recklessness, statements that put \na person in a false light, like a fictionalized biography, are actionable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are many kinds of intentional torts. Some of them involve harm to the physical person or to his or her \nproperty, reputation or feelings, or economic interests. In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff must \nshow that the defendant intended harm, but the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a particular \nperson and need not be malicious, as long as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the defendant’s \nactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Accidents caused by negligence are actionable. \n \nDetermining negligence is not always easy. If a driver runs a red light, we can say that he is negligent \nbecause a driver must always be careful to ascertain whether the light is red and be able to stop if it is. \nSuppose that the driver was carrying a badly injured person to a nearby hospital and that after slowing \ndown at an intersection, went through a red light, blowing his horn, whereupon a driver to his right, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n298 \nseeing him, drove into the intersection anyway and crashed into him.

            "chunk": "305 \nLegislatures in many states have enacted laws that make people vicariously liable for acts of certain people \nwith whom they have a relationship, though not necessarily one of agency. It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now \nturn. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe most common tort claim is based on the negligence of the defendant. In each negligence claim, the \nplaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant had a duty of due care, (2) \nthe defendant breached that duty, (3) that the breach of duty both actually and approximately has caused \nharm to the plaintiff, and (4) that the harm is measurable in money damages. \nIt is also possible for the negligence of one person to be imputed to another, as in the case of respondeat \nsuperior, or in the case of someone who loans his automobile to another driver who is negligent and causes \ninjury.

Understand the historical origins of strict liability under common law. \n3. Be able to apply strict liability concepts to liability for defective products. \n4. Distinguish strict liability from absolute liability, and understand the major defenses to a lawsuit in \nproducts-liability cases. \n \n \n \nHistorical Basis of Strict Liability: Animals and Ultrahazardous Activities \nTo this point, we have considered principles of liability that in some sense depend upon the “fault” of the \ntortfeasor. This fault is not synonymous with moral blame. \n \nAside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or \ndue care. But this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis. As we \nhave already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage \nthat he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone \nwho engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that \nhe causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n307 \n \nLikewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring \nproperty may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., \na fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door). In such cases, the courts invoke the principle of \nstrict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability without fault. The reason for the rule is explained \nin Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"). \n \nStrict Liability for Products \nProducts liability is extremely important. Strict liability may also apply as a legal standard for products, \neven those that are not ultrahazardous. In some national legal systems, strict liability is not available as a \ncause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer, \nwholesaler, distributor, or retailer. (Some states limit liability to the manufacturer.) But it is available in \nthe United States and initially was created by a California Supreme Court decision in the 1962 case \nof Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. \n \nIn Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and \nmanufactured by the defendant. He was experienced in using power tools and was injured while using the \napproved lathe attachment to the Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice. The case was decided on the",

                    "answer": "Strict liability torts differ from negligent torts in that strict liability does not require proof of fault or negligence on the part of the defendant. Instead, the defendant is held liable regardless of whether they were at fault or not. This principle is often applied in cases involving ultrahazardous activities or the ownership of potentially dangerous animals. For instance, if a person engages in an ultrahazardous activity such as storing explosives, they can be held strictly liable for any damage caused, irrespective of whether they took all possible precautions to prevent harm. Similarly, the owner of a wild or dangerous animal that escapes and causes damage to neighboring property can be held strictly liable, even if the escape was beyond the owner's control. Additionally, the principle of strict liability is also applied in product liability cases, where manufacturers can be held liable for defects in their products without needing to prove negligence."

We conclude from this record that the University’s very limited actions concerning safety of \nstudent recreation did not give Whitlock or the other members of campus fraternities or sororities any \nreason to depend upon the University for evaluation of the safety of trampoline use.…Therefore, we \nconclude that the student-university relationship is not a special relationship of the type giving rise to a \nduty of the University to take reasonable measures to protect the members of fraternities and sororities \nfrom risks of engaging in extra-curricular trampoline jumping. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n318 \n \nThe plaintiff asserts, however, that we should recognize a duty of the University to take affirmative action \nto protect fraternity members because of the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the risks involved in \ntrampoline use, the seriousness of potential injuries, and the University’s superior knowledge concerning \nthese matters. The argument in essence is that a duty should spring from the University’s natural interest \nin the welfare and safety of its students, its superior knowledge of the nature and degree of risk involved \nin trampoline use, and its knowledge of the use of trampolines on the University campus. The evidence \namply supports a conclusion that trampoline use involves risks of serious injuries and that the potential \nfor an injury such as that experienced by Whitlock was foreseeable. It shows further that prior injuries \nresulting from trampoline accidents had been reported to campus security and to the student clinic, and \nthat University administrators were aware of the number and severity of trampoline injuries nationwide. \n \nThe record, however, also establishes through Whitlock’s own testimony that he was aware of the risk of \nan accident and injury of the very nature that he experienced.… \n \nWe conclude that the relationship between the University and Whitlock was not one of dependence with \nrespect to the activities at issue here, and provides no basis for the recognition of a duty of the University \nto take measures for protection of Whitlock against the injury that he suffered. \n \nB. \nWe next examine the lease between the University and the fraternity to determine whether a special \nrelationship between the University and Whitlock can be predicated on that document. The lease was \nexecuted in 1929, extends for a ninety-nine year term, and gives the fraternity the option to extend the \nterm for another ninety-nine years. The premises are to be occupied and used by the fraternity “as a \nfraternity house, clubhouse, dormitory and boarding house, and generally for religious, educational, social \nand fraternal purposes.” Such occupation is to be “under control of the tenant.” (emphasis added) The \nannual rental at all times relevant to this case appears from the record to be one dollar. The University has \nthe obligation to maintain the grounds and make necessary repairs to the building, and the fraternity is to \nbear the cost of such maintenance and repair. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n319 \n \n… \n \nWe conclude that the lease, and the University’s actions pursuant to its rights under the lease, provide no \nbasis of dependence by the fraternity members upon which a special relationship can be found to exist \nbetween the University and the fraternity members that would give rise to a duty upon the University to \ntake affirmative action to assure that recreational equipment such as a trampoline is not used under \nunsafe conditions. \n \nIV. \nConsidering all of the factors presented, we are persuaded that under the facts of this case the University \nof Denver had no duty to Whitlock to eliminate the private use of trampolines on its campus or to \nsupervise that use. There exists no special relationship between the parties that justifies placing a duty \nupon the University to protect Whitlock from the well-known dangers of using a trampoline. Here, a \nconclusion that a special relationship existed between Whitlock and the University sufficient to warrant \nthe imposition of liability for nonfeasance would directly contravene the competing social policy of \nfostering an educational environment of student autonomy and independence. \n \nWe reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and return this case to that court with directions to \nremand it to the trial court for dismissal of Whitlock’s complaint against the University. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Despite evidence supporting the foreseeability of injuries and the University's awareness of past incidents, the text notes that Whitlock himself acknowledged the risks of using a trampoline. Additionally, the University’s lease agreement with the fraternity house emphasized that the premises were to be controlled by the tenant, implying a lack of dependency on the University for safety evaluations. Consequently, the court concluded that the relationship between the University and Whitlock did not justify imposing a duty on the University to protect him from the well-known dangers of trampoline use, as this would conflict with fostering an educational environment of student autonomy and independence."

Long Island R.R. \n248 N.Y. 339,162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928) \n \nCARDOZO, Chief Judge \n \nPlaintiff was standing on a platform of defendant’s railroad after buying a ticket to go to Rockaway Beach. \nA train stopped at the station, bound for another place. Two men ran forward to catch it. One of the men \nreached the platform of the car without mishap, though the train was already moving. The other man, \ncarrying a package, jumped aboard the car, but seemed unsteady as if about to fall. A guard on the car, \nwho had held the door open, reached forward to help him in, and another guard on the platform pushed \nhim from behind. In this act, the package was dislodged, and fell upon the rails. It was a package of small \nsize, about fifteen inches long, and was covered by a newspaper. In fact it contained fireworks, but there \nwas nothing in its appearance to give notice of its contents. The fireworks when they fell exploded. The \nshock of· the explosion threw down some scales at the other end of the platform many feet away. The \nscales struck the plaintiff, causing injuries for which she sues. \n \nThe conduct of the defendant’s guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a \nwrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relatively to her it was not negligence at all. \nNothing in the situation gave notice that the falling package had in it the potency of peril to persons thus \nremoved. Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the \nviolation of a right. “Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do.…If no hazard was apparent to \nthe eye of ordinary vigilance, an act innocent and harmless, at least to outward seeming, with reference to \nher, did not take to itself the quality of a tort because it happened to be a wrong, though apparently not \none involving the risk of bodily insecurity, with reference to someone else.…The plaintiff sues in her own \nright for a wrong personal to her, and not as the vicarious beneficiary of a breach of duty to another. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n321 \nA different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions. A guard stumbles over \na package which has been left upon a platform. \n \nIt seems to be a bundle of newspapers. It turns out to be a can of dynamite. To the eye of ordinary \nvigilance, the bundle is abandoned waste, which may be kicked or trod on with impunity. Is a passenger at \nthe other end of the platform protected by the law against the unsuspected hazard concealed beneath the \nwaste? If not, is the result to be any different, so far as the distant passenger is concerned, when the guard \nstumbles over a valise which a truckman or a porter has left upon the walk?…The orbit of the danger as \ndisclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty. One who jostles one’s neighbor \nin a crowd does not invade the rights of others standing at the outer fringe when the unintended contact \ncasts a bomb upon the ground. The wrongdoer as to them is the man who carries the bomb, not the one \nwho explodes it without suspicion of the danger. Life will have to be made over, and human nature \ntransformed, before prevision so extravagant can be accepted as the norm of conduct, the customary \nstandard to which behavior must conform. \n \nThe argument for the plaintiff is built upon the shifting meanings of such words as “wrong” and \n“wrongful” and shares their instability. For what the plaintiff must show is a “wrong” to herself; i.e., a \nviolation of her own right, and not merely a “wrong” to someone else, nor conduct “wrongful” because \nunsocial, but not a “wrong” to anyone. We are told that one who drives at reckless speed through a \ncrowded city street is guilty of a negligent act and therefore of a wrongful one, irrespective of the \nconsequences. \n \nNegligent the act is, and wrongful in the sense that it is unsocial, but wrongful and unsocial in relation to",

The court explains that negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest. In this specific case, the defendant's guard's action of reaching forward to help the man on the moving train, which resulted in the package being dislodged and subsequently exploding, was not considered a tort towards the plaintiff. This is because, from the perspective of the plaintiff standing far away, there was no apparent hazard posed by the package, making the act of the guard harmless and innocent. The court argues that for an act to be considered a tort, it must involve the risk of bodily insecurity to the plaintiff, which was not the case here. Therefore, the guard's actions, while potentially negligent towards the person on the train, were not actionable as a tort towards the plaintiff who was standing far away and unaware of the potential danger."

Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner \nthat is important to business. The parties create contract duties through a bargaining process. The \nkey element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the \nfreedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the role of contract in society: it moves society from status to contract. \n2. Know the definition of a contract. \n3. Recognize the sources of contract law: the common law, the UCC, and the Convention on the International \nSale of Goods—a treaty (the CISG). \n4. Understand some fundamental contract taxonomy and terminology. \n \n \nThe Role of Contract in Society \nContract is probably the most familiar legal concept in our society because it is so central to a deeply held \nconviction about the essence of our political, economic, and social life. In common parlance, the term is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n329 \nused interchangeably with agreement, bargain, undertaking, or deal; but whatever the word, it embodies \nour notion of freedom to pursue our own lives together with others. Contract is central because it is the \nmeans by which a free society orders what would otherwise be a jostling, frenetic anarchy. So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that",

Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law. The judge or jury may award at its discretion whatever sum is \nbelieved necessary to redress the wrong or deter like conduct in the future. This means that a richer \nperson may be slapped with much heavier punitive damages than a poorer one in the appropriate case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n353 \nBut the judge in all cases may remit (lower) some or all of a punitive damage award if he or she considers \nit excessive. \n \nPunitive damage claims have been made in cases dealing with the refusal by insurance companies to \nhonor their contracts. Many of these cases involve disability payments, and among the elements are \ncharges of tortious conduct by the company’s agents or employees. California has been the leader among \nthe state courts in their growing willingness to uphold punitive damage awards despite insurer complaints \nthat the concept of punitive damages is but a device to permit plaintiffs to extort settlements from hapless \ncompanies. Courts have also awarded punitive damages against other types of companies for breach of \ncontract. \n \nSpecific Performance \nSpecific performance is a judicial order to the promisor that he undertake the performance to which \nhe obligated himself in a contract. Specific performance is an alternative remedy to damages and may be \nissued at the discretion of the court, subject to a number of exceptions. (When the promisee is seeking \nenforcement of a contractual provision for forbearance—a promise that the promisor will refrain from \ndoing something—an injunction, a judicial order not to act in a specified manner, may be the appropriate \nremedy.) Emily signs a contract to sell Charlotte a gold samovar, a Russian antique of great sentimental \nvalue because it once belonged to Charlotte’s mother. Emily then repudiates the contract while still \nexecutory. A court may properly grant Charlotte an order of specific performance against Emily. Specific \nperformance is an attractive but limited remedy: it is only available for breach of contract to sell a unique \nitem (real estate is always unique). \n \nRestitution \nAs the word implies, restitution is a restoring to one party of what he gave to the other. Therefore, only \nto the extent that the injured party conferred a benefit on the other party may the injured party be \nawarded restitution. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n354 \nIf the claimant has given the other party a sum of money, there can be no dispute over the amount of the \nrestitution interest. Tom gives Tim $100 to chop his tree into firewood. Tim repudiates. Tom’s restitution \ninterest is $100. But serious difficulties can arise when the benefit conferred was performance. The courts \nhave considerable discretion to award either the cost of hiring someone else to do the work that the \ninjured party performed (generally, the market price of the service) or the value that was added to the \nproperty of the party in breach by virtue of the claimant’s performance. Mellors, a gardener, agrees to \nconstruct ten fences around Lady Chatterley’s flower gardens at the market price of $2,500. After erecting \nthree, Mellors has performed services that would cost $750, market value. Assume that he has increased \nthe value of the Lady’s grounds by $800. If the contract is repudiated, there are two measures of Mellors’s \nrestitution interest: $800, the value by which the property was enhanced; or $750, the amount it would \nhave cost Lady Chatterley to hire someone else to do the work. Which measure to use depends on who \nrepudiated the contract and for what reason. \n \nTort vs. Contract Remedies \nFrequently a contract breach may also amount to tortious conduct. A physician warrants her treatment as \nperfectly safe but performs the operation negligently, scarring the patient for life. The patient could sue \nfor malpractice (tort) or for breach of warranty (contract). The choice involves at least four \nconsiderations: \n1. Statute of limitations. Most statutes of limitations prescribe longer periods for contract than for tort \nactions. \n2. Allowable damages. Punitive damages are more often permitted in tort actions, and certain kinds of \ninjuries are compensable in tort but not in contract suits—for example, pain and suffering. \n3. Expert testimony.

Unlike compensatory damages, which aim to make the plaintiff whole by reimbursing them for losses suffered, punitive damages serve as a form of retribution and deterrence. They are not fixed by law and the amount awarded is left to the discretion of the judge or jury, based on what they believe is necessary to redress the wrong and deter similar conduct in the future. This means that the amount can vary significantly depending on the circumstances and the financial status of the defendant. For instance, a richer person might face heavier punitive damages compared to a poorer one in the same situation.

Lucy, complainants, against A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. \nZehmer, his wife, defendants, to have specific performance of a contract by which it was alleged the \nZehmers had sold to W. O. Lucy a tract of land owned by A. H. Zehmer in Dinwiddie county containing \n471.6 acres, more or less, known as the Ferguson farm, for $50,000. J. C. Lucy, the other complainant, is \na brother of W. O. Lucy, to whom W. O. Lucy transferred a half interest in his alleged purchase. \n \nThe instrument sought to be enforced was written by A. H. Zehmer on December 20, 1952, in these words: \n“We hereby agree to sell to W. O. Lucy the Ferguson farm complete for $50,000.00, title satisfactory to \nbuyer,” and signed by the defendants, A. H. Zehmer and Ida S. Zehmer. \n \nThe answer of A. H. Zehmer admitted that at the time mentioned W. O. Lucy offered him $50,000 cash \nfor the farm, but that he, Zehmer, considered that the offer was made in jest; that so thinking, and both he \nand Lucy having had several drinks, he wrote out “the memorandum” quoted above and induced his wife \nto sign it; that he did not deliver the memorandum to Lucy, but that Lucy picked it up, read it, put it in his \npocket, attempted to offer Zehmer $5 to bind the bargain, which Zehmer refused to accept, and realizing \nfor the first time that Lucy was serious, Zehmer assured him that he had no intention of selling the farm \nand that the whole matter was a joke. Lucy left the premises insisting that he had purchased the farm.… \n \nIn his testimony Zehmer claimed that he “was high as a Georgia pine,” and that the transaction “was just a \nbunch of two doggoned drunks bluffing to see who could talk the biggest and say the most.” That claim is \ninconsistent with his attempt to testify in great detail as to what was said and what was done.… \n \nIf it be assumed, contrary to what we think the evidence shows, that Zehmer was jesting about selling his \nfarm to Lucy and that the transaction was intended by him to be a joke, nevertheless the evidence shows \nthat Lucy did not so understand it but considered it to be a serious business transaction and the contract \nto be binding on the Zehmers as well as on himself. The very next day he arranged with his brother to put \nup half the money and take a half interest in the land. The day after that he employed an attorney to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n357 \nexamine the title.

First, the statute of limitations for each type of lawsuit varies, with contracts typically allowing for longer periods than tort actions. Second, allowable damages differ between the two types of lawsuits; punitive damages are more commonly granted in tort actions, and certain injuries, such as pain and suffering, can only be compensated through tort suits. Third, the requirement for expert testimony might vary; while it is generally necessary in both tort and contract cases, it can be dispensed with in contract cases where the breach involves a clear issue, like abandonment. Finally, insurance coverage plays a role, as most policies do not cover intentional torts, making a contract theory preferable if the breach is unintentional and the plaintiff seeks money damages."

The next night, Tuesday, he was back at Zehmer’s place and there Zehmer told him for \nthe first time, Lucy said, that he wasn’t going to sell and he told Zehmer, “You know you sold that place \nfair and square.” After receiving the report from his attorney that the title was good he wrote to Zehmer \nthat he was ready to close the deal. \n \nNot only did Lucy actually believe, but the evidence shows he was warranted in believing, that the contract \nrepresented a serious business transaction and a good faith sale and purchase of the farm. \n \nIn the field of contracts, as generally elsewhere, “We must look to the outward expression of a person as \nmanifesting his intention rather than to his secret and unexpressed intention. The law imputes to a person \nan intention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts.” \n \nAt no time prior to the execution of the contract had Zehmer indicated to Lucy by word or act that he was \nnot in earnest about selling the farm. They had argued about it and discussed its terms, as Zehmer \nadmitted, for a long time. Lucy testified that if there was any jesting it was about paying $50,000 that \nnight. The contract and the evidence show that he was not expected to pay the money that night. Zehmer \nsaid that after the writing was signed he laid it down on the counter in front of Lucy. Lucy said Zehmer \nhanded it to him. In any event there had been what appeared to be a good faith offer and a good faith \nacceptance, followed by the execution and apparent delivery of a written contract. Both said that Lucy put \nthe writing in his pocket and then offered Zehmer $5 to seal the bargain. Not until then, even under the \ndefendants’ evidence, was anything said or done to indicate that the matter was a joke. Both of the \nZehmers testified that when Zehmer asked his wife to sign he whispered that it was a joke so Lucy \nwouldn’t hear and that it was not intended that he should hear. \n \nThe mental assent of the parties is not requisite for the formation of a contract. If the words or other acts \nof one of the parties have but one reasonable meaning, his undisclosed intention is immaterial except \nwhen an unreasonable meaning which he attaches to his manifestations is known to the other party. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n358 \n“* * * The law, therefore, judges of an agreement between two persons exclusively from those expressions \nof their intentions which are communicated between them. * * *.” [Citation] \n \nAn agreement or mutual assent is of course essential to a valid contract but the law imputes to a person an \nintention corresponding to the reasonable meaning of his words and acts. If his words and acts, judged by \na reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree, it is immaterial what may be the real but \nunexpressed state of his mind. \n \nSo a person cannot set up that he was merely jesting when his conduct and words would warrant a \nreasonable person in believing that he intended a real agreement. \n \nWhether the writing signed by the defendants and now sought to be enforced by the complainants was the \nresult of a serious offer by Lucy and a serious acceptance by the defendants, or was a serious offer by Lucy \nand an acceptance in secret jest by the defendants, in either event it constituted a binding contract of sale \nbetween the parties.… \n \nReversed and remanded. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. What objective evidence was there to support the defendants’ contention that they were just kidding when \nthey agreed to sell the farm? \n2. Suppose the defendants really did think the whole thing was a kind of joke. Would that make any \ndifference? \n3.

                    "answer": "The law uses an objective standard to determine the seriousness of intention in forming a contract because it ensures fairness and predictability in commercial transactions. By focusing on the outward expression of intent, as reasonably understood by both parties, the law avoids the potential for disputes based on individual subjective beliefs. An objective standard allows third parties to rely on the apparent terms of the contract without having to second-guess the subjective states of mind of the contracting parties. This standard also promotes consistency in legal outcomes and prevents one party from exploiting the other through hidden intentions or misunderstandings."

Article 2 governs the sale of \ngoods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. When the goods \nare “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies. For two categories \nof goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood \nsupplied for transfusions is not. \n \nTypes of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-\ncontracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) \ncompleted (executed) and uncompleted (executory). To understand contract law, it is necessary to master \nthese distinctions and their nuances. \n \nIn order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be \nanswered: (1) Did the parties reach an agreement? (2) Was consideration present? (3) Was the agreement \nlegal? (4) Did the parties have capacity to make a contract? (5) Was the agreement in the proper form? \n \nRemedies available against someone who breaches a contract include damages, specific performance, and \nrestitution. Frequently the party who is not in breach must choose between tort and contract remedies. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n366 \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. On November 26, Joe wrote to Kate offering to purchase a farm that she owned. Upon receiving the letter \non November 28, Kate immediately sent Joe a letter of acceptance. However, shortly after mailing the \nletter, Kate had second thoughts and called Joe to advise him that she was rejecting his offer. The call was \nmade before Joe received the letter of acceptance. Has a contract been formed? Why? \n2. On a busy day just before April 15, Albert Accountant received a call from a local car dealer. The dealer said, \n“Hi, Mr. Accountant. Now, while you have income from doing clients’ taxes, I have an excellent offer for \nyou. You can buy a new Buick Century automobile completely loaded for $36,000. Al, I know you’re busy. If \nI don’t hear from you by the end of the day, I’ll assume you want the car.” Albert, distracted, did not \nrespond immediately, and the dealer hung up. Then followed an exhausting day of working with anxiety-\nridden tax clients. Albert forgot about the conversation. Two days later a statement arrived from the \ndealer, with instructions on how Albert should pick up the car at the dealership. Is there a contract? \nExplain. \n3. Bert purchased Ernie’s car. Before selling the car, Ernie had stated to Bert, “This car runs well and is \nreliable. Last week I drove the car all the way from Seattle to San Francisco to visit my mother and back \nagain to Seattle.” In fact, Ernie was not telling the truth: he had driven the car to San Francisco to visit his \nparamour, not his mother. Upon discovery of the truth, may Bert avoid the contract? Why? \n4. Langstraat was seventeen when he purchased a motorcycle. When applying for insurance, he signed a \n“Notice of Rejection,” declining to purchase uninsured motorist coverage. He was involved in an accident \nwith an uninsured motorist and sought to disaffirm his rejection of the uninsured motorist coverage on the \nbasis of infancy. May he do so? \n5. Richard promised to have Darlene’s deck awning constructed by July 10. On June 20, Darlene called him \nand asked if he could get the job done by July 3, in time for Independence Day. Richard said he could, but \nhe failed to do so, and Darlene had to rent two canopies at some expense. Darlene claims that because \nRichard breached his promise, he is liable for the cost of awning rental. Is she correct—was his promise \nbinding?

This article provides a comprehensive set of rules for transactions involving the sale of goods, defining 'goods' as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. Unlike general contract law, which can cover a wide range of agreements, Article 2 is specifically tailored to address the unique aspects of commercial transactions involving goods, such as warranties, risk of loss, and remedies for breach. The UCC aims to harmonize and modernize the law governing these transactions, providing a consistent framework for businesses and consumers alike."

A party can determine if they are in breach of a contract by reviewing the terms of the agreement, assessing whether the obligations specified have been fulfilled, and considering the remedies available under the law. If a party fails to perform their obligations as stipulated in the contract, they are considered in breach. Remedies for breach typically include damages, specific performance, and restitution, among others, and may be pursued by the non-breaching party to seek compensation or enforcement of the contract terms."

            "chunk": "the Bureau’s attention that many employers are requiring that those who work for them sign ‘independent \ncontractor’ forms so that the employer does not have to pay workmen’s compensation premiums for his \nemployees. Such forms are meaningless if the worker is in fact an employee.” Vizcaino v. Microsoft \nCorporation, discussed in Section 9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\", examines the \ndistinction. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n378 \nIn addition to determining a worker’s status for tax and compensation insurance purposes, it is \nsometimes critical for decisions involving personal liability insurance policies, which usually exclude from \ncoverage accidents involving employees of the insureds. General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. \nPro Golf Association [3] involved such a situation. The insurance policy in question covered members of \nthe Professional Golfers Association. Gerald Hall, a golf pro employed by the local park department, was \nafforded coverage under the policy, which excluded “bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising \nout of and in the course of his employment by the insured.” That is, no employee of Hall’s would be \ncovered (rather, any such person would have coverage under workers’ compensation statutes). Bradley \nMartin, age thirteen, was at the golf course for junior league play. At Hall’s request, he agreed to retrieve \nor “shag” golf balls to be hit during a lesson Hall was giving; he was—as Hall put it—to be compensated \n“either through golf instructions or money or hotdogs or whatever.” During the course of the lesson, a golf \nball hit by Hall hit young Martin in the eye. If Martin was an employee, the insurance company would be \nliable; if he was not an employee, the insurance company would not liable. The trial court determined he \nwas not an employee. The evidence showed: sometimes the boys who “shagged” balls got paid, got golfing \ninstructions, or got food, so the question of compensation was ambiguous. Martin was not directed in how \nto perform (the admittedly simple) task of retrieving golf balls, no control was exercised over him, and no \nequipment was required other than a bag to collect the balls: “We believe the evidence is susceptible of \ndifferent inferences.…We cannot say that the decision of the trial court is against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.” \n \nCreation of the Agency Relationship \nThe agency relationship can be created in two ways: by agreement (expressly) or by operation of law \n(constructively or impliedly). \n \n \nAgency Created by Agreement \nMost agencies are created by contract. Thus the general rules of contract law covered in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" govern the law of agency. But agencies can also be created without contract, by agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n379 \nTherefore, three contract principles are especially important: the first is the requirement for \nconsideration, the second for a writing, and the third concerns contractual capacity. \n \nConsideration \nAgencies created by consent—agreement—are not necessarily contractual. It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent.

In the case of General Accident Fire & Life Assurance Corp v. Pro Golf Association, this exclusion played a crucial role in determining whether the insurance company was liable for an accident that occurred at a golf course. A thirteen-year-old boy named Bradley Martin was injured while retrieving golf balls during a lesson given by a golf pro named Gerald Hall, who was employed by the local park department. The insurance policy excluded 'bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured.' Since the policy did not cover injuries sustained by employees, the determination of whether Martin was an employee or an independent contractor had significant implications for the insurance company's liability. The trial court found that Martin was not an employee, leading to the conclusion that the insurance company was not liable for his injuries."

                    "answer": "Agencies are typically created by contract, making the general rules of contract law applicable. However, agencies can also be created without a formal contract, relying instead on mutual agreement. Three key contract principles are essential for the creation of an agency: consideration, a writing, and the capacity of the parties involved. Consideration refers to the exchange of something of value between the parties, ensuring that the agreement is not gratuitous. While most oral agency agreements are legally binding, there are instances where a written contract is necessary, such as when the agency's purpose cannot be fulfilled within one year, when an agreement involves paying a commission to a real estate broker, or when an agent is given authority to sell real estate. Furthermore, contracts made by agents with third parties often need to be in writing, as mandated by laws like Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which requires written and signed contracts for the sale of goods valued at five hundred dollars or more."

If the loss is partial (like partial loss of sight), the recovery is decreased \nby the percentage still usable. \n \nCoverage \nAlthough workers’ compensation laws are on the books of every state, in two states—New Jersey and \nTexas—they are not compulsory. In those states the employer may decline to participate, in which event \nthe employee must seek redress in court. But in those states permitting an employer election, the old \ncommon-law defenses (fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence, and assumption of risk) have been \nstatutorily eliminated, greatly enhancing an employee’s chances of winning a suit. The incentive is \ntherefore strong for employers to elect workers’ compensation coverage. \n \nThose frequently excluded are farm and domestic laborers and public employees; public employees, \nfederal workers, and railroad and shipboard workers are covered under different but similar laws. The \ntrend has been to include more and more classes of workers. Approximately half the states now provide \ncoverage for household workers, although the threshold of coverage varies widely from state to state. \nSome use an earnings test; other states impose an hours threshold. People who fall within the domestic \ncategory include maids, baby-sitters, gardeners, and handymen but generally not plumbers, electricians, \nand other independent contractors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n391 \n \nPaying for Workers’ Compensation \nThere are three general methods by which employers may comply with workers’ compensation laws. First, \nthey may purchase employer’s liability and workers’ compensation policies through private commercial \ninsurance companies. These policies consist of two major provisions: payment by the insurer of all claims \nfiled under workers’ compensation and related laws (such as occupational disease benefits) and coverage \nof the costs of defending any suits filed against the employer, including any judgments awarded. Since \nworkers’ compensation statutes cut off the employee’s right to sue, how can such a lawsuit be filed? The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is. For example, Washington State’s \n2011 proposed hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance include these items: for egg and poultry \nfarms, $1.16 per hour; shake and shingle mills, $18.06 per hour; asphalt paving, $2.87 per hour; lawn care \nmaintenance, $1.22 per hour; plastic products manufacturing, $0.87 per hour; freight handling, $1.81 per \nhour; supermarkets, $0.76; restaurants, $0.43; entertainers and dancers, $7.06; colleges and universities, \n$0.31. [6] \n \nRecurring Legal Issues \nThere are a number of legal issues that recur in workers’ compensation cases. The problem is, from the \nemployer’s point of view, that the cost of buying insurance is tied to the number of claims made. The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n•",

                    "answer": "Employers can comply with workers' compensation laws through three general methods: purchasing employer's liability and workers' compensation policies through private commercial insurance companies, insuring through a state fund established for the purpose, or self-insuring. The cost of the insurance is influenced by the number and seriousness of claims made, with larger corporations often qualifying for self-insurance. For example, in Washington State, the hourly rates for employers to purchase insurance vary significantly depending on the type of business, ranging from $0.31 for colleges and universities to $18.06 per hour for shake and shingle mills."

Admittedly, this individual, one Buster Douglas, is not \nits employee in the usual sense but with the knowledge of defendant, he did station himself in front of its \nrestaurant, wore a doorman’s uniform and had been parking its customers’ autos. The parties stipulated \nthat if he were held to be defendant’s employee, this created a bailment between the parties [and the \n“employer” would have to rebut a presumption of negligence if the customer’s property was not returned \nto the customer]. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n395 \nOn April 20, 1968, at about 10 P.M., plaintiff drove his 1967 Cadillac Coupe de Ville to the door of the \nDirectoire Restaurant at 160 East 48th Street in Manhattan. Standing in front of the door was Buster \nDouglas, dressed in a self-supplied uniform, comprised of a regular doorman’s cap and matching jacket. \nPlaintiff gave the keys to his vehicle to Douglas and requested that he park the car. He gave Douglas a \n$1.00 tip and received a claim check. Plaintiff then entered defendant’s restaurant, remained there for \napproximately 45 minutes and when he departed, Douglas was unable to locate the car which was never \nreturned to plaintiff. \n \nAt the time of this occurrence, the restaurant had been open for only nine days, during which time \nplaintiff had patronized the restaurant on at least one prior occasion. \n \nDefendant did not maintain any sign at its entrance or elsewhere that it would provide parking for its \ncustomers (nor, apparently, any sign warning to the contrary). \n \nBuster Douglas parked cars for customers of defendant’s restaurant and at least three or four other \nrestaurants on the block. He stationed himself in front of each restaurant during the course of an evening \nand was so engaged during the evening of April 20, 1968. Defendant clearly knew of and did not object to \nDouglas’ activities outside its restaurant. Defendant’s witness testified at an examination before trial: \nQ. Did anybody stand outside your restaurant in any capacity whatsoever? \nA. There was a man out there parking cars for the block, but he was in no way connected with us \nor anything like that. He parked cars for the Tamburlaine and also for the Chateau Madrid, \nNepentha and a few places around the block. \n \nQ. Did you know that this gentleman was standing outside your restaurant? \nA. Yes, I knew he was there. \n \nQ. How did you know that he was standing outside your restaurant? \nA. Well, I knew the man’s face because I used to work in a club on 55th Street and he was there. \nWhen we first opened up here, we didn’t know if we would have a doorman or have parking \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n396 \nfacilities or what we were going to do at that time.

The law imposes a fiduciary duty on agents to ensure they act in the best interest of their principals, beyond mere honesty and fair dealing, to protect the principal's interests and prevent conflicts of interest. This duty arises because agents have access to confidential information and a position of trust, making it essential that they prioritize the principal's welfare over personal gain or other considerations."

The ESPP specifically \nprovides: \n \nIt is the intention of the Company to have the Plan qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” \nunder Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The provisions of the Plan shall, \naccordingly, be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a manner consistent with the \nrequirements of that Section of the Code. (emphasis added) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n402 \n \n[T]he ESPP, when construed in a manner consistent with the requirements of § 423, extends participation \nto all common-law employees not covered by one of the express exceptions set forth in the plan. \nAccordingly, we find that the ESPP, through its incorporation of § 423, expressly extends eligibility for \nparticipation to the plaintiff class and affords them the same options to acquire stock in the corporation as \nall other employees. \n \nMicrosoft next contends that the [employment agreements] signed by the plaintiffs render them ineligible \nto participate in the ESPP. First, the label used in the instruments signed by the plaintiffs does not control \ntheir employment status. Second, the employment instruments, if construed to exclude the plaintiffs from \nreceiving ESPP benefits, would conflict with the plan’s express incorporation of § 423. Although Microsoft \nmay have generally intended to exclude individuals who were in fact independent contractors, it could \nnot, consistent with its express intention to extend participation in the ESPP to all common-law \nemployees, have excluded the plaintiffs. Indeed, such an exclusion would defeat the purpose of including § \n423 in the plan, because the exclusion of common-law employees not otherwise accepted would result in \nthe loss of the plan’s tax qualification. \n \nFinally, Microsoft maintains that the plaintiffs are not entitled to ESPP benefits because the terms of the \nplan were never communicated to them and they were therefore unaware of its provisions when they \nperformed their employment services.…In any event, to the extent that knowledge of an offer of benefits is \na prerequisite, it is probably sufficient that Microsoft publicly promulgated the plan. In [Citation], the \nplaintiff was unaware of the company’s severance plan until shortly before his termination. The Oklahoma \nSupreme Court concluded nonetheless that publication of the plan was “the equivalent of constructive \nknowledge on the part of all employees not specifically excluded.” \n \nWe are not required to rely, however, on the [this] analysis or even on Microsoft’s own unwitting \nconcession. There is a compelling reason, implicit in some of the preceding discussion, that requires us to \nreject the company’s theory that the plaintiffs’ entitlement to ESPP benefits is defeated by their previous \nlack of knowledge regarding their rights. It is “well established” that an optionor may not rely on an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n403 \noptionee’s failure to exercise an option when he has committed any act or failed to perform any duty \n“calculated to cause the optionee to delay in exercising the right.” [Citation] “[T]he optionor may not \nmake statements or representations calculated to cause delay, [or] fail to furnish [necessary] \ninformation.…” Similarly, “[I]t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause \nof the failure of performance, either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own \nliability depends, he cannot take advantage of the failure.” [Citation]… \n \nApplying these principles, we agree with the magistrate judge, who concluded that Microsoft, which \ncreated a benefit to which the plaintiffs were entitled, could not defend itself by arguing that the plaintiffs \nwere unaware of the benefit, when its own false representations precluded them from gaining that \nknowledge. Because Microsoft misrepresented both the plaintiffs’ actual employment status and their \neligibility to participate in the ESPP, it is responsible for their failure to know that they were covered by \nthe terms of the offer. It may not now take advantage of that failure to defeat the plaintiffs’ rights to ESPP \nbenefits. Thus, we reject Microsoft’s final argument. \n \nConclusion \nFor the reasons stated, the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Microsoft and denial of \nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs is REVERSED and the case REMANDED for the \ndetermination of any questions of individual eligibility for benefits that may remain following issuance of",

But here, no evidence was presented to rebut the evidence given by Bacon and Johnson \nthat they engaged in no such practices before their employment with VSC ended.

Sibley, Lindsay & Curr Co. \n330 N.E.2d 603 (N.Y. 1975) \n \nWachtler, J. \n \nThis appeal involves a claim for workmen’s compensation benefits for the period during which the \nclaimant was incapacitated by severe depression caused by the discovery of her immediate supervisor’s \nbody after he had committed suicide. \n \nThe facts as adduced at a hearing before the Workmen’s Compensation Board are uncontroverted. The \nclaimant, Mrs. Diana Wolfe, began her employment with the respondent department store, Sibley, \nLindsay & Curr Co. in February, 1968. After working for some time as an investigator in the security \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n408 \ndepartment of the store she became secretary to Mr. John Gorman, the security director. It appears from \nthe record that as head of security, Mr. Gorman was subjected to intense pressure, especially during the \nChristmas holidays. Mrs. Wolfe testified that throughout the several years she worked at Sibley’s Mr. \nGorman reacted to this holiday pressure by becoming extremely agitated and nervous. She noted, \nhowever, that this anxiety usually disappeared when the holiday season was over. Unfortunately, Mr. \nGorman’s nervous condition failed to abate after the 1970 holidays.… \nDespite the fact that he followed Mrs. Wolfe’s advice to see a doctor, Mr. Gorman’s mental condition \ncontinued to deteriorate. On one occasion he left work at her suggestion because he appeared to be so \nnervous. This condition persisted until the morning of June 9, 1971 when according to the claimant, Mr. \nGorman looked much better and even smiled and ‘tousled her hair’ when she so remarked. \n \nA short time later Mr. Gorman called her on the intercom and asked her to call the police to room 615. \nMrs. Wolfe complied with this request and then tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Gorman on the \nintercom. She entered his office to find him lying in a pool of blood caused by a self-inflicted gunshot \nwound in the head. Mrs. Wolfe became extremely upset and was unable to continue working that day. \n \nShe returned to work for one week only to lock herself in her office to avoid the questions of her fellow \nworkers. Her private physician perceiving that she was beset by feelings of guilt referred her to a \npsychiatrist and recommended that she leave work, which she did. While at home she ruminated about \nher guilt in failing to prevent the suicide and remained in bed for long periods of time staring at the \nceiling. The result was that she became unresponsive to her husband and suffered a weight loss of 20 \npounds. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Grinols diagnosed her condition as an acute depressive reaction. \n \nAfter attempting to treat her in his office Dr. Grinols realized that the severity of her depression mandated \nhospitalization. Accordingly, the claimant was admitted to the hospital on July 9, 1971 where she \nremained for two months during which time she received psychotherapy and medication. After she was \ndischarged, Dr. Grinols concluded that there had been no substantial remission in her depression and \nruminative guilt and so had her readmitted for electroshock treatment. These treatments lasted for three \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n409 \nweeks and were instrumental in her recovery. She was again discharged and, in mid-January, 1972, \nresumed her employment with Sibley, Lindsay & Curr. \nMrs. Wolfe’s claim for workmen’s compensation was granted by the referee and affirmed by the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Board. On appeal the Appellate Division reversed citing its opinions in \n[Citations], [concluding]…that mental injury precipitated solely by psychic trauma is not compensable as \na matter of law. We do not agree with this conclusion. \n \nWorkmen’s compensation, as distinguished from tort liability which is essentially based on fault, is \ndesigned to shift the risk of loss of earning capacity caused by industrial accidents from the worker to \nindustry and ultimately the consumer. In light of its beneficial and remedial character the Workmen’s \nCompensation Law should be construed liberally in favor of the employee [Citation]. \n \nLiability under the act is predicated on accidental injury arising out of and in the course of \nemployment.…Applying these concepts to the case at bar we note that there is no issue raised concerning \nthe causal relationship between the occurrence and the injury. The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition. Nor is there any question as to the absence of physical impact. \nAccordingly, the focus of our inquiry is whether or not there has been an accidental injury within the",

Understand the agent’s personal liability for tort. \n2. Understand the agent’s personal liability for contract. \n3. Recognize the ways the agency relationship is terminated. \n \n \nAgent’s Personal Liability for Torts and Contracts \nTort Liability \nThat a principal is held vicariously liable and must pay damages to an injured third person does not \nexcuse the agent who actually committed the tortious acts. A person is always liable for his or her own \ntorts (unless the person is insane, involuntarily intoxicated, or acting under extreme duress). The agent is \npersonally liable for his wrongful acts and must reimburse the principal for any damages the principal was \nforced to pay, as long as the principal did not authorize the wrongful conduct. The agent directed to \ncommit a tort remains liable for his own conduct but is not obliged to repay the principal. Liability as an \nagent can be burdensome, sometimes perhaps more burdensome than as a principal. The latter normally \npurchases insurance to cover against wrongful acts of agents, but liability insurance policies frequently do \nnot cover the employee’s personal liability if the employee is named in a lawsuit individually. Thus \ndoctors’ and hospitals’ malpractice policies protect a doctor from both her own mistakes and those of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n432 \nnurses and others that the doctor would be responsible for; nurses, however, might need their own \ncoverage. In the absence of insurance, an agent is at serious risk in this lawsuit-conscious age. The risk is \nnot total. The agent is not liable for torts of other agents unless he is personally at fault—for example, by \nnegligently supervising a junior or by giving faulty instructions. For example, an agent, the general \nmanager for a principal, hires Brown as a subordinate. Brown is competent to do the job but by failing to \nexercise proper control over a machine negligently injures Ted, a visitor to the premises. The principal \nand Brown are liable to Ted, but the agent is not. \n \nContract Liability \nIt makes sense that an agent should be liable for her own torts; it would be a bad social policy indeed if a \nperson could escape tort liability based on her own fault merely because she acted in an agency capacity. It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. We consider each situation. \n \nAgent for Undisclosed or Partially Disclosed Principal \nAn agent need not, and frequently will not, inform the person with whom he is negotiating that he is \nacting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433",

                    "answer": "The 'zone of risk' test is a legal concept used to determine whether an employer is liable for an employee's intentional torts. According to this test, an employer is liable for an employee's intentional tort if the tort was committed within the 'zone of risk'—that is, if the tort occurred during the course of employment or if the employee was acting to further the employer's business interests. The 'zone of risk' includes activities that the employee is authorized to perform, as well as those that are closely related to the employee's duties. This test helps to establish whether the employer had a duty to prevent the employee's intentional tort and whether the employer breached that duty."

Either by action of the parties or by law, the relationship will \neventually terminate. \n \nBy Act of the Parties \nCertainly the parties to an agency contract can terminate the agreement. As with the creation of the \nrelationship, the agreement may be terminated either expressly or implicitly. \n \nExpress Termination \nMany agreements contain specified circumstances whose occurrence signals the end of the agency. The \nmost obvious of these circumstances is the expiration of a fixed period of time (“agency to terminate at the \nend of three months” or “on midnight, December 31”). An agreement may also terminate on the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n435 \naccomplishment of a specified act (“on the sale of the house”) or following a specific event (“at the \nconclusion of the last horse race”). \n \nMutual consent between the parties will end the agency. Moreover, the principal may revoke the agency or \nthe agent may renounce it; such a revocation or renunciation of agency would be an express \ntermination. Even a contract that states the agreement is irrevocable will not be binding, although it can \nbe the basis for a damage suit against the one who breached the agreement by revoking or renouncing it. \nAs with any contract, a person has the power to breach, even in absence of the right to do so. If the agency \nis coupled with an interest, however, so that the authority to act is given to secure an interest that the \nagent has in the subject matter of the agency, then the principal lacks the power to revoke the agreement. \n \nImplied Termination \nThere are a number of other circumstances that will spell the end of the relationship by implication. \nUnspecified events or changes in business conditions or the value of the subject matter of the agency \nmight lead to a reasonable inference that the agency should be terminated or suspended; for example, the \nprincipal desires the agent to buy silver but the silver market unexpectedly rises and silver doubles in \nprice overnight. Other circumstances that end the agency include disloyalty of the agent (e.g., he accepts \nan appointment that is adverse to his first principal or embezzles from the principal), bankruptcy of the \nagent or of the principal, the outbreak of war (if it is reasonable to infer that the principal, knowing of the \nwar, would not want the agent to continue to exercise authority), and a change in the law that makes a \ncontinued carrying out of the task illegal or seriously interferes with it. \n \n \nBy Operation of Law \nAside from the express termination (by agreement of both or upon the insistence of one), or the necessary \nor reasonable inferences that can be drawn from their agreements, the law voids agencies under certain \ncircumstances. The most frequent termination by operation of law is the death of a principal or an agent. \nThe death of an agent also terminates the authority of subagents he has appointed, unless the principal \nhas expressly consented to the continuing validity of their appointment. Similarly, if the agent or principal \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n436 \nloses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, it is suspended or terminated. The agency terminates if \nits purpose becomes illegal. \n \nEven though authority has terminated, whether by action of the parties or operation of law, the principal \nmay still be subject to liability. Apparent authority in many instances will still exist; this is \ncalled lingering authority. It is imperative for a principal on termination of authority to notify all those \nwho may still be in a position to deal with the agent. The only exceptions to this requirement are when \ntermination is effected by death, loss of the principal’s capacity, or an event that would make it impossible \nto carry out the object of the agency. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA person is always liable for her own torts, so an agent who commits a tort is liable; if the tort was in the \nscope of employment the principal is liable too. Unless the principal put the agent up to committing the tort, \nthe agent will have to reimburse the principal. An agent is not generally liable for contracts made; the \nprincipal is liable. But the agent will be liable if he is undisclosed or partially disclosed, if the agent lacks \nauthority or exceeds it, or, of course, if the agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. \nAgencies terminate expressly or impliedly or by operation of law. An agency terminates expressly by the terms \nof the agreement or mutual consent, or by the principal’s revocation or the agent’s renunciation. An agency \nterminates impliedly by any number of circumstances in which it is reasonable to assume one or both of the \nparties would not want the relationship to continue.

By the action of the parties, an agency can be terminated explicitly or implicitly. Explicit termination includes circumstances like the expiration of a fixed period, accomplishment of a specified act, or following a specific event. Mutual consent between the parties, the principal's revocation of the agency, or the agent's renunciation of the agency are also forms of explicit termination. Implied termination occurs due to unspecified events or changes in business conditions that reasonably imply the end of the relationship. For instance, the principal's desire for a different price of a commodity, the agent's disloyalty, bankruptcy of the agent or principal, outbreak of war, or a change in law making the task illegal or interfering with it. By operation of law, an agency is terminated in cases where a principal or agent dies, loses capacity to enter into an agency relationship, or if the purpose of the agency becomes illegal."

                    "answer": "Even after an agency's authority has been terminated, the principal may still be subject to liability under certain circumstances. This is because apparent authority, known as lingering authority, may still exist. For example, if an agent continues to act on behalf of the principal after the termination of their authority, third parties might still believe the agent has the authority to act. In such cases, the principal could be held liable for the actions of the agent. To mitigate this risk, it is imperative for the principal to notify all relevant parties of the termination of the agency relationship, except in cases where termination is due to death, loss of capacity, or an event that makes it impossible to carry out the agency's objectives."

The judge’s reason for so doing was that the plaintiff, in his contract action, failed to introduce \nsufficient evidence tending to prove that the bank officer who made the agreement with which the plaintiff \nsought to charge the bank had any authority to make it. Upon review of the record we are of opinion that \nthere was evidence which, if believed, warranted a finding that the bank officer had the requisite authority \nor that the bank officer had apparent authority to make the agreement in controversy. We therefore \nreverse the judgment. \n \nFor approximately ten years prior to 1975, Harold Kanavos and his brother borrowed money on at least \ntwenty occasions from the Hancock Bank & Trust Company (the Bank), and, during that period, the loan \nofficer with whom Kanavos always dealt was James M. Brown. The aggregate loans made by the Bank to \nKanavos at any given time went as high as $800,000. \n \nOver that same decade, Brown’s responsibilities at the Bank grew, and he had become executive vice-\npresident. Brown was also the chief loan officer for the Bank, which had fourteen or fifteen branches in \naddition to its head office. Physically, Brown’s office was at the head office, toward the rear of the main \nbanking floor, opposite the office of the president—whose name was Kelley. Often Brown would tell \nKanavos that he had to check an aspect of a loan transaction with Kelley, but Kelley always backed Brown \nup on those occasions. \n… \n[The plaintiff, Harold Kanavos, entered into an agreement with the defendant Bank whereby stock owned \nby the Kanavos brothers was sold to the Bank and the plaintiff was given an option to repurchase the \nstock. Kanavos’ suit against the Bank was based on an amendment to the agreement offered by Brown.] \n \nKanavos was never permitted to introduce in evidence the terms of the offer Brown made. That offer was \ncontained in a writing, dated July 16, 1976, on bank letterhead, which read as follows: “This letter is to \nconfirm our conversation regarding your option to re-purchase the subject property.

A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating \nthat partnership property, real or personal, could be held in the name of the partners as “tenants in \npartnership”—a type of co-ownership—or it could be held in the name of the partnership. [8] Under RUPA, \n“property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.” [9] But RUPA \nis no different from UPA in practical effect. The latter provides that “property originally brought into the \npartnership stock or subsequently acquired by purchase…on account of the partnership, is partnership \nproperty.” [10] Under either law, a partner may bring onto the partnership premises her own property, not \nacquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and it remains her separate property. Under \nneither law can a partner unilaterally dispose of partnership property, however labeled, for the obvious \nreason that one cannot dispose of another’s property or property rights without permission.

                    "answer": "The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) affects the ownership of real estate by a partnership in a manner similar to the original Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). Both laws provide that partnership property, whether real or personal, can be held in the name of the partners as 'tenants in partnership' or in the name of the partnership itself. RUPA explicitly states that 'property acquired by the partnership is property of the partnership and not of the partners.' However, under both laws, a partner may bring their own property onto the partnership premises if it was not acquired in the name of the partnership or with its credit, and this property remains the partner's separate property. Additionally, neither law permits a partner to unilaterally dispose of partnership property, highlighting the importance of mutual consent in such matters. While RUPA codifies existing state laws and allows partners to tailor their partnership agreements, the practical effect of RUPA on real estate ownership is largely consistent with UPA."

Describe the creation of an express partnership. \n2. Describe the creation of an implied partnership. \n3. Identify tests of partnership existence. \n4. Understand partnership by estoppel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n464 \n \nCreation of an Express Partnership \nCreation in General \nThe most common way of forming a partnership is expressly—that is, in words, orally or in writing. Such a \npartnership is called an express partnership. If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership. Able contributes \n$250,000. Baker contributes the building and space in which the business will operate. Carr contributes \nhis services; he will manage the dealership. \n \nThe first question is whether Able, Baker, and Carr must have a partnership agreement. As should be clear \nfrom the foregoing discussion, no agreement is necessary as long as the tests of partnership are met. \nHowever, they ought to have an agreement in order to spell out their rights and duties among themselves. \n \nThe agreement itself is a contract and should follow the principles and rules spelled out in Chapter 8 \n\"Contracts\" of this book. Because it is intended to govern the relations of the partners toward themselves \nand their business, every partnership contract should set forth clearly the following terms: (1) the name \nunder which the partners will do business; (2) the names of the partners; (3) the nature, scope, and \nlocation of the business; (4) the capital contributions of each partner; (5) how profits and losses are to be \ndivided; (6) how salaries, if any, are to be determined; (7) the responsibilities of each partner for \nmanaging the business; (8) limitations on the power of each partner to bind the firm; (9) the method by \nwhich a given partner may withdraw from the partnership; (10) continuation of the firm in the event of a \npartner’s death and the formula for paying a partnership interest to his heirs; and (11) method of \ndissolution. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n465 \nSpecific Issues of Concern \nIn forming a partnership, three of these items merit special attention. And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to",

                    "answer": "RUPA applies to fill in the gaps of a partnership agreement when the parties do not provide for certain specific issues in their agreement. According to the text, RUPA covers three specific areas: (1) Who can be a partner, allowing for associations between entities like corporations or even partnerships themselves; (2) written versus oral agreements, stating that if the business cannot be performed within one year from the time the agreement is entered into, the partnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds; and (3) the validity of the partnership name, ensuring that the name accurately reflects the nature of the business and does not cause confusion with existing businesses. RUPA essentially serves as a default set of rules for these areas if they are not explicitly covered in the partnership agreement."

This doctrine allows for individuals who represent themselves as partners to be held liable as partners to those who deal with them in good faith, even if there is no actual partnership. Specifically, the doctrine of partnership by estoppel means that when a person or entity holds itself out as a partner to the public, any individual dealing with the entity on the faith of such representation is entitled to assume the relation continues until notice of its discontinuance is given. This applies even if the individuals involved are not actual partners among themselves. Thus, individuals who knowingly or negligently permit others to hold them out as partners can be estopped from denying liability as partners to those who extend credit in reliance on such representations."

The Havana Club operated in Salt Lake City under a lease running to defendant Dale Bowen, who owned \nthe equipment, furnishings, and inventory. He did not himself work in operating the club. He made an oral \nagreement with Frances Cutler, who had been working for him as a bartender, that she take over the \nmanagement of the club. She was to have the authority and the responsibility for the entire active \nmanagement and operation: to purchase the supplies, pay the bills, keep the books, hire and fire \nemployees, and do whatever else was necessary to run the business. As compensation, the arrangement \nwas for a down-the-middle split; each was to receive $300 per week plus one half of the net profits. This \nwent on for four years until the city took over the building for a redevelopment project.

Partnerships are inherently joint ventures, meaning all partners are jointly and severally liable for the partnership's obligations. This means that creditors can pursue any partner for the full amount owed, regardless of the partnership agreement or the partners' individual contributions. The clues to the existence of a partnership, such as co-ownership of a business, sharing of profits, and the right to participate in decision-making, indicate that partners share both the benefits and the risks of the business. Therefore, even without a formal partnership agreement, partners can be held individually responsible for the partnership's debts and liabilities, making it crucial for potential partners to understand the implications of entering into such an informal arrangement and to document their agreements clearly to avoid misunderstandings and disputes."

Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404. [8] \n \nThe Rights That Partners Have in a Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n496 \nNecessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of",

This duty prohibits partners from competing with the partnership, making secret profits during partnership business, and maintaining the confidentiality of partnership information. For instance, a partner cannot engage in activities that would harm the partnership or benefit themselves at the expense of the firm."

Even after winning a judgment, the plaintiff may \nsue other partners unnamed in the original action. Each and every partner is separately liable for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n509 \nentire amount of the debt, although the plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the total of his \ndamages. The practical effect of the rules making partners personally liable for partnership contracts and \ntorts can be huge. In his classic textbook Economics, Professor Paul Samuelson observed that unlimited \nliability “reveals why partnerships tend to be confined to small, personal enterprises.…When it becomes a \nquestion of placing their personal fortunes in jeopardy, people are reluctant to put their capital into \ncomplex ventures over which they can exercise little control.…In the field of investment banking, concerns \nlike JPMorgan Chase used to advertise proudly ‘not incorporated’ so that their creditors could have extra \nassurance. But even these concerns have converted themselves into corporate entities.” [8] \n \nPartners’ Personal Liability for Torts \nOf course, a person is always liable for his own torts. All partners are also liable for any partner’s tort \ncommitted in the scope of partnership business under agency law, and this liability is—again—personal \nand unlimited, subject to RUPA’s requirement that the judgment creditor exhaust the partnership’s assets \nbefore going after the separate assets of the partners. The partner who commits a tort or breach of trust \nmust indemnify the partnership for losses paid to the third party. [9] \nLiability for Crimes \nCriminal liability is generally personal to the miscreant. Nonparticipating copartners are ordinarily not \nliable for crimes if guilty intent is an element. When guilty intent is not an element, as in certain \nregulatory offenses, all partners may be guilty of an act committed by a partner in the course of the \nbusiness. \n \nLiability for Taxes \nCorporate income gets taxed twice under federal law: once to the corporation and again to the \nshareholders who receive income as dividends. However, the partnership’s income “passes through” the \npartnership and is distributed to the partners under the conduit theory. When partners get income \nfrom the firm they have to pay tax on it, but the partnership pays no tax (it files an information return). \nThis is perceived to be a significant advantage of the partnership form. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n510 \n \nThe partnership is generally liable for any contract made by a partner with authority express, implied, or \napparent.

This liability is personal and unlimited, joint and several (although under UPA \ncontract liability it is only joint).

This means that the plaintiff can sue one or more partners separately, and even after winning a judgment against one partner, the plaintiff can still sue other partners who were not named in the original action. Each partner is individually responsible for the entire amount of the debt, although the plaintiff cannot recover more than the total damages sustained. RUPA expands liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the partnership without first having to leave it, as required under UPA. Furthermore, RUPA permits the filing of 'statements' with the appropriate state registrar to limit liability, although such statements only affect those who know about them, except for notices related to real estate transactions, dissociation, or dissolution, which become effective after ninety days."

Partners must pay taxes on the income they receive from the firm, while the partnership itself does not pay tax (it files an information return).

In some circumstances, a court will order dissolution upon the \napplication of a purchaser of a partner’s interest. [4] \n \nEffect of Dissolution on Authority \nFor the most part, dissolution terminates the authority of the partners to act for the partnership. The only \nsignificant exceptions are for acts necessary to wind up partnership affairs or to complete transactions \nbegun but not finished at the time of dissolution. [5] Notwithstanding the latter exception, no partner can \nbind the partnership if it has dissolved because it has become unlawful to carry on the business or if the \npartner seeking to exercise authority has become bankrupt. \n \nAfter Dissolution \nAfter a partnership has dissolved, it can follow one of two paths. It can carry on business as a new \npartnership, or it can wind up the business and cease operating (see Figure 12.2 \"Alternatives Following \nUPA Dissolution\"). \n \nFigure 12.2 Alternatives Following UPA Dissolution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n514 \n \nForming a New Partnership \nIn order to carry on the business as a new partnership, there must be an agreement—preferably as part of \nthe original partnership agreement but maybe only after dissolution (and maybe oral)—that upon \ndissolution (e.g., if a partner dies, retires, or quits) the others will regroup and carry on. \n \nUnder UPA the remaining partners have the right to carry on when (1) the dissolution was in \ncontravention of the agreement, (2) a partner was expelled according to the partnership agreement, or (3) \nall partners agree to carry on. [6] \n \nWhether the former partner dies or otherwise quits the firm, the noncontinuing one or his, her, or its legal \nrepresentative is entitled to an accounting and to be paid the value of the partnership interest, less \ndamages for wrongful dissolution. [7] The firm may need to borrow money to pay the former partner or her \nestate; or, in the case of a deceased partner, the money to pay the former partner is obtained through a life \ninsurance buyout policy. \n \nPartnerships routinely insure the lives of the partners, who have no ownership interests in the insurance \npolicies. The policies should bear a face amount equal to each partner’s interest in the partnership and \nshould be adjusted as the fortunes of the partnership change. Proceeds of the insurance policy are used on \ndeath to pay the purchase price of the interest inherited by the deceased’s estate. If the insurance policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n515 \npays out more than the interest at stake, the partnership retains the difference. If the policy pays out less, \nthe partnership agrees to pay the difference in installments. \n \nAnother set of issues arises when the partnership changes because an old partner departs and a new one \njoins. Suppose that Baker leaves the car dealership business and his interest is purchased by Alice, who is \nthen admitted to the partnership. Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000. After Baker left and Alice joined, Mogul sells another $5,000 \nworth of parts to the firm on credit, and Sizzling Radiator Repair, a new creditor, advances $3,000 worth \nof radiator repair parts. These circumstances pose four questions. \n \nFirst, do creditors of the old partnership remain creditors of the new partnership? Yes. [8] \n \nSecond, does Baker, the old partner, remain liable to the creditors of the old partnership? Yes. [9] That \ncould pose uncomfortable problems for Baker, who may have left the business because he lost interest in \nit and wished to put his money elsewhere. The last thing he wants is the threat of liability hanging over his \nhead when he can no longer profit from the firm’s operations. That is all the more true if he had a falling \nout with his partners and does not trust them. The solution is given in UPA Section 36(2), which says that \nan old partner is discharged from liability if the creditors and the new partnership agree to discharge him. \n \nThird, is Alice, the new partner, liable to creditors of the old partnership? Yes, but only to the extent of her \ncapital contribution. [10] \n \nFourth, is Baker, the old partner, liable for debts incurred after his withdrawal from the partnership? \nSurprisingly, yes, unless Baker takes certain action toward old and new creditors. He must provide actual \nnotice that he has withdrawn to anyone who has extended credit in the past. Once he has done so, he has \nno liability to these creditors for credit extended to the partnership thereafter. Of course, it would be \ndifficult to provide notice to future creditors, since at the time of withdrawal they would not have had a",

The court characterizes the defendant as having “cheated his partner”—that is, Conway committed \nfraud. (Gilroy said his business had been “stolen.”) Fraud is a tort. Punitive damages may be awarded \nagainst a tortfeasor, even in a jurisdiction that generally disallows punitive damages in contract. In fact, \npunitive damages are sometimes awarded for breach of the partnership fiduciary duty. In Cadwalader, \nWickersham & Taft v. Beasley, 728 So.2d 253 (Florida Ct. App., 1998), a New York law firm was found \nto have wrongfully expelled a partner lawyer, Beasley, from membership in its Palm Beach, Florida, \noffices. New York law controlled. The trial court awarded Beasley $500,000 in punitive damages. The \nappeals court, construing the same UPA as the court construed in Gilroy, said: \nUnder New York law, the nature of the conduct which justifies an award of punitive damages is \nconduct having a high degree of moral culpability, or, in other words, conduct which shows a \n“conscious disregard of the rights of others or conduct so reckless as to amount to such \ndisregard.”…[S]ince the purpose of punitive damages is to both punish the wrongdoer and deter others \nfrom such wrongful behavior, as a matter of policy, courts have the discretion to award punitive \ndamages[.]…[The defendant] was participating in a clandestine plan to wrongfully expel some \npartners for the financial gain of other partners. Such activity cannot be said to be honorable, much \nless to comport with the “punctilio of an honor.” Because these findings establish that [the defendant] \nconsciously disregarded the rights of Beasley, we affirm the award of punitive damages. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n529 \n \nAs a matter of social policy, which is the better ruling, the Michigan court’s in Gilroy or the Florida court’s \nin Cadwalader? \n \n \nPartnership Authority, Express or Apparent \nHodge v Garrett \n614 P.2d 420 (Idaho 1980) \n \nBistline, J. \n \n[Plaintiff] Hodge and defendant-appellant Rex E.

The agreement for the sale of land stated that it was \nbetween Hodge and the Pay-Ont Drive-In Theatre, a partnership. Voeller signed the agreement for the \npartnership, and written changes as to the footage and price were initialed by Voeller.

Pass-through (“conduit”) taxation is usually \nvery important to partners. \nTermination \nThe limited partnership’s termination involves the same three steps as in a general partnership: (1) \ndissolution, (2) winding up, and (3) termination. \n \nDissolution \nDissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not \nnecessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court \norder, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events \nmay cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2) \ntermination upon an event specified in the partnership agreement; (3) the unanimous written consent of \nthe partners; (4) the withdrawal of a general partner, unless at least one remains and the agreement says \none is enough, or if within ninety days all partners agree to continue; (5) an event that causes the business \nto be illegal; and (6) judicial decree of dissolution when it is not reasonable to carry on. If the agreement \nhas no term, its dissolution is not triggered by some agreed-to event, and none of the other things listed \ncause dissolution. \n \nDissolution requires the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the state if winding up commences. \n \nWinding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n555 \nGeneral partners who have not wrongfully dissolved the partnership may wind it up, and so may the \nlimited partners if all the general partners have wrongfully dissolved the firm. Any partner or that \nperson’s legal representative can petition a court for winding up, with cause. \n \nUpon winding up, the assets are distributed (1) to creditors, including creditor-partners, not including \nliabilities for distributions of profit; (2) to partners and ex-partners to pay off unpaid distributions; (3) to \npartners as return of capital contributions, unless otherwise agreed; and (4) to partners for partnership \ninterests in proportion as they share in distributions, unless otherwise agreed. No distinction is made \nbetween general and limited partners—they share equally, unless otherwise agreed. When winding up is \ncompleted, the firm is terminated. \n \nIt is worth reiterating the part about “unless otherwise agreed”: people who form any kind of a business \norganization—partnership, a hybrid form, or corporations—can to a large extent choose to structure their \nrelationship as they see fit. Any aspect of the company’s formation, operation, or ending that is not \nincluded in an agreement flops into the default provisions of the relevant law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA limited partnership is a creature of statute: it requires filing a certificate with the state because it confers on \nsome of its members the marvel of limited liability. It is an investment device composed of one or more \ngeneral partners and one or more limited partners; limited partners may leave with six months’ notice and are \nentitled to an appropriate payout. The general partner is liable as a partner is a general partnership; the \nlimited partners’ liability is limited to the loss of their investment, unless they exercise so much control of the \nfirm as to become general partners. The general partner is paid, and the general and limited partners split \nprofit as per the agreement or, if none, in the proportion as they made capital contributions. The firm is \nusually taxed like a general partnership: it is a conduit for the partners’ income. The firm is dissolved upon the \nend of its term, upon an event specified in the agreement, or in several other circumstances, but it may have \nindefinite existence. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n556 \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

                    "answer": "The termination of a limited partnership involves three main steps: dissolution, winding up, and termination. Dissolution is initiated by various events such as the termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions, termination upon an event specified in the partnership agreement, the unanimous written consent of the partners, the withdrawal of a general partner with certain conditions, an event that makes the business illegal, or a judicial decree of dissolution when it is not reasonable to continue. Upon dissolution, a certificate of cancellation must be filed with the state if winding up proceedings commence. Winding up involves the orderly liquidation of the partnership's assets according to a specific sequence: first, to creditors including creditor-partners, then to partners and ex-partners to settle unpaid distributions, followed by returning capital contributions to partners, and finally distributing profits in proportion to their shares unless otherwise agreed. After winding up is complete, the firm is officially terminated. The process allows partners to structure their relationships and terms as they see fit, with default provisions falling back to relevant laws if agreements are not specified."

            "chunk": "partnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5] \n \nIn the discussion of limited partnerships, we noted that ULPA-2001 eliminates the “control rule” so that \nlimited partners who exercise day-to-day control are not thereby liable as general partners. Now, in the \nsection quoted in the previous paragraph, the general partner’s liability for partnership obligations is \nvaporized too. (Of course, the general partner is liable for its, his, or her own torts.) The preface to ULPA-\n2001 explains, “In a limited liability limited partnership (‘LLLP’), no partner—whether general or \nlimited—is liable on account of partner status for the limited partnership’s obligations. Both general and \nlimited partners benefit from a full, status-based liability shield that is equivalent to the shield enjoyed by \ncorporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in an LLP.” \n \nPresumably, most existing limited partnerships will switch over to LLLPs. The ULPA-2001 provides that \n“the Act makes LLLP status available through a simple statement in the certificate of limited partnership.” \n \nEthical Concerns \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n568 \nThere was a reason that partnership law imposed personal liability on the partners: people tend to be \nmore careful when they are personally liable for their own mistakes and bad judgment. Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three. And of course corporate limited liability has existed for two hundred \nyears. [6] Whether the movement to allow almost anybody the right to a business organization that affords \nlimited liability will encourage entrepreneurship and business activity or whether it will usher in a new \nera of moral hazard—people being allowed to escape the consequences of their own irresponsibility—is \nyet to be seen. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBusinesspeople always prefer to reduce their risks. The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. The principal disadvantage of the general partnership is that it imposes unlimited personal liability on the \npartners. What is the disadvantage of the corporate form? \n2. Why isn’t the limited partnership an entirely satisfactory solution to the liability problem of the \npartnership? \n3.

            "chunk": "corporations were creatures of the state or church. By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total",

                    "question": "What were the key differences in how corporations were formed in England and the United States during the early modern period, and how did this affect their development?",
                    "answer": "Corporations in England were initially formed through royal grants or concessions, which were known as charters. These charters were particularly significant for large trading companies like the British East India Company, Hudson's Bay Company, and the South Sea Company. The granting of these charters was a process that required royal approval and was often subject to stringent regulations and limitations. In contrast, the United States saw incorporation primarily through special acts of state legislatures, though the number of such acts increased significantly, especially in the 1790s and beyond. By the mid-1800s, many states allowed incorporation through general statutes, which greatly facilitated the process. This difference in approach led to a more rapid development of corporations in the United States compared to England, where corporate development was severely hampered by the Bubble Act and the lack of trust in chartered companies. The U.S. Supreme Court also played a role in shaping corporate law, notably in Gibbons v. Ogden, which expanded federal authority over interstate commerce, and in Paul v. Virginia, which opened the door for foreign corporations to operate within state boundaries if engaged in interstate business."

Know what rights a corporate “person” and a natural person have in common. \n2. Recognize when a corporate “veil” is pierced and shareholder liability is imposed. \n3. Identify other instances when a shareholder will be held personally liable. \n \nIn comparing partnerships and corporations, there is one additional factor that ordinarily tips the balance \nin favor of incorporating: the corporation is a legal entity in its own right, one that can provide a “veil” \nthat protects its shareholders from personal liability. \n \nFigure 14.1 The Corporate Veil \n \n \nThis crucial factor accounts for the development of much of corporate law. Unlike the individual actor in \nthe legal system, the corporation is difficult to deal with in conventional legal terms. The business of the \nsole proprietor and the sole proprietor herself are one and the same. When a sole proprietor makes a \ndecision, she risks her own capital. When the managers of a corporation take a corporate action, they are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n594 \nrisking the capital of others—the shareholders. Thus accountability is a major theme in the system of law \nconstructed to cope with legal entities other than natural persons. \n \n \n \nThe Basic Rights of the Corporate “Person” \nTo say that a corporation is a “person” does not automatically describe what its rights are, for the \ncourts have not accorded the corporation every right guaranteed a natural person. Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection. They are also entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against \nunreasonable search and seizure; in other words, the police must have a search warrant to enter corporate \npremises and look through files. Warrants, however, are not required for highly regulated industries, such \nas those involving liquor or guns. The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to criminal prosecutions of \ncorporations: an acquittal cannot be appealed nor can the case be retried. For purposes of the federal \ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of both the state in which it is \nincorporated and the state in which it has its principal place of business (often, the corporate \n“headquarters”). \n \nUntil relatively recently, few cases had tested the power of the state to limit the right of corporations to \nspend their own funds to speak the “corporate mind.” Most cases involving corporate free speech address \nadvertising, and few states have enacted laws that directly impinge on the freedom of companies to \nadvertise. But those states that have done so have usually sought to limit the ability of corporations to \nsway voters in public referenda. In 1978, the Supreme Court finally confronted the issue head on in First \nNational Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (Section 14.7.1 \"Limiting a Corporation’s First Amendment Rights\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n595 \nThe ruling in Bellotti was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to",

                    "answer": "Forming a corporation provides several advantages over other business structures like partnerships. One key advantage is the legal entity status of the corporation, which creates a 'veil' that protects shareholders from personal liability. This means that the personal assets of shareholders are generally safe from claims against the corporation, encouraging investment without the risk of losing personal savings. Another advantage is perpetual existence, meaning the corporation can continue indefinitely, unlike a partnership which ends upon the death or withdrawal of a partner. Additionally, corporations can raise capital more easily through the sale of stocks and bonds, and they offer better access to credit than partnerships. However, there are also significant disadvantages. Corporations face higher initial costs and ongoing expenses, such as registration fees, annual reports, and compliance with various regulations. There is also the complexity of governance, requiring a board of directors and adherence to corporate formalities. Furthermore, double taxation is a concern, where corporate profits are taxed at the corporate level and then again when distributed to shareholders as dividends. Lastly, shareholders may lose control over the company due to the need for approval from multiple stakeholders."

There are two broad types of \nbusiness corporations: publicly held (or public) and closely held (or close or private) corporations. Again, \nboth types are private in the sense that they are not governmental. \n \nThe publicly held corporation is one in which stock is widely held or available for wide public distribution \nthrough such means as trading on a national or regional stock exchange. Its managers, if they are also \nowners of stock, usually constitute a small percentage of the total number of shareholders and hold a \nsmall amount of stock relative to the total shares outstanding. Few, if any, shareholders of public \ncorporations know their fellow shareholders. \n \nBy contrast, the shareholders of the closely held corporation are fewer in number. Shares in a closely held \ncorporation could be held by one person, and usually by no more than thirty. Shareholders of the closely \nheld corporation often share family ties or have some other association that permits each to know the \nothers. \n \nThough most closely held corporations are small, no economic or legal reason prevents them from being \nlarge. Some are huge, having annual sales of several billion dollars each. Roughly 90 percent of US \ncorporations are closely held. \n \nThe giant publicly held companies with more than $1 billion in assets and sales, with initials such as IBM \nand GE, constitute an exclusive group. Publicly held corporations outside this elite class fall into two \nbroad (nonlegal) categories: those that are quoted on stock exchanges and those whose stock is too widely \ndispersed to be called closely held but is not traded on exchanges. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n601 \nThere are four major classifications of corporations: (1) nonprofit, (2) municipal, (3) professional, and (4) \nbusiness.

The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted.

They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides \notherwise or unless all the subscribers consent to revocation.

For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state.

                    "answer": "A promoter can be held liable for contracts entered into before the corporation's incorporation if the corporation is not formed or if the corporation refuses to accept the contract. This is because, under agency law, the promoter acts as an agent for the corporation, and if the corporation does not ratify the contract, the promoter remains personally liable. However, if the corporation formally accepts the contract after its formation, the promoter may be relieved of liability in some states, provided there is an express novation or the intention of the parties is clearly stated in the contract. In states adhering strictly to agency rules, the ratification theory will not help, and the promoter will remain liable."

Distinguish between a de jure and a de facto corporation. \n2. Define the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. \n \n \nDe Jure and De Facto Corporations \nIf promoters meet the requirements of corporate formation, a de jure corporation, considered a legal \nentity, is formed. Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

The three traditional conditions for recognizing a corporation as 'de facto' are: (1) the existence of a statute under which the corporation could have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a genuine effort to comply with the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. These conditions help establish that the corporation was intended to be legally formed and has acted in a manner consistent with such intent, even if the formalities were not completed perfectly."

Under the plain language of §107(a)(2), any person who operates a polluting facility is directly \nliable for the costs of cleaning up the pollution, and this is so even if that person is the parent corporation \nof the facility’s owner. Because the statute does not define the term “operate,” however, it is difficult to \ndefine actions sufficient to constitute direct parental “operation.” In the organizational sense obviously \nintended by CERCLA, to “operate” a facility ordinarily means to direct the workings of, manage, or \nconduct the affairs of the facility. To sharpen the definition for purposes of CERCLA’s concern with \nenvironmental contamination, an operator must manage, direct, or conduct operations specifically related \nto the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or decisions about compliance with environmental \nregulations. \n \n(b) The Sixth Circuit correctly rejected the direct liability analysis of the District Court, which mistakenly \nfocused on the relationship between parent and subsidiary, and premised liability on little more than \nCPC’s ownership of Ott II and its majority control over Ott II’s board of directors. Because direct liability \nfor the parent’s operation of the facility must be kept distinct from derivative liability for the subsidiary’s \noperation of the facility, the analysis should instead have focused on the relationship between CPC and \nthe facility itself, i.e., on whether CPC “operated” the facility, as evidenced by its direct participation in the \nfacility’s activities. That error was compounded by the District Court’s erroneous assumption that actions \nof the joint officers and directors were necessarily attributable to CPC, rather than Ott II, contrary to time-\nhonored common-law principles. The District Court’s focus on the relationship between parent and \nsubsidiary (rather than parent and facility), combined with its automatic attribution of the actions of dual \nofficers and directors to CPC, erroneously, even if unintentionally, treated CERCLA as though it displaced \nor fundamentally altered common-law standards of limited liability. The District Court’s analysis created \nwhat is in essence a relaxed, CERCLA-specific rule of derivative liability that would banish traditional \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n617 \nstandards and expectations from the law of CERCLA liability. Such a rule does not arise from \ncongressional silence, and CERCLA’s silence is dispositive. \n \n(c) Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit erred in limiting direct liability under CERCLA to a parent’s sole or joint \nventure operation, so as to eliminate any possible finding that CPC is liable as an operator on the facts of \nthis case. The ordinary meaning of the word “operate” in the organizational sense is not limited to those \ntwo parental actions, but extends also to situations in which, e.g., joint officers or directors conduct the \naffairs of the facility on behalf of the parent, or agents of the parent with no position in the subsidiary \nmanage or direct activities at the subsidiary’s facility. Norms of corporate behavior (undisturbed by any \nCERCLA provision) are crucial reference points, both for determining whether a dual officer or director \nhas served the parent in conducting operations at the facility, and for distinguishing a parental officer’s \noversight of a subsidiary from his control over the operation of the subsidiary’s facility. There is, in fact, \nsome evidence that an agent of CPC alone engaged in activities at Ott II’s plant that were eccentric under \naccepted norms of parental oversight of a subsidiary’s facility: The District Court’s opinion speaks of such \nan agent who played a conspicuous part in dealing with the toxic risks emanating from the plant’s \noperation. The findings in this regard are enough to raise an issue of CPC’s operation of the facility, \nthough this Court draws no ultimate conclusion, leaving the issue for the lower courts to reevaluate and \nresolve in the first instance. \n \n113 F.3d 572, vacated and remanded. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Under CERCLA, a parent corporation can be directly liable for operating a polluting facility, even if it is the parent corporation of the facility’s owner. This liability arises when the parent corporation manages, directs, or conducts operations specifically related to the leakage or disposal of hazardous waste, or makes decisions about compliance with environmental regulations. However, the Sixth Circuit Court disagreed with the District Court's analysis, which mistakenly focused on the relationship between the parent and subsidiary and premised liability on little more than the parent’s ownership and majority control over the subsidiary's board of directors. Instead, the Sixth Circuit emphasized that the focus should be on the relationship between the parent and the facility itself, specifically whether the parent operated the facility through direct participation in its activities.

                    "answer": "The court looks to norms of corporate behavior to determine if a parent’s officer or director is involved in the operation of a facility. These norms include whether the officer or director serves the parent in conducting operations at the facility, or if agents of the parent with no position in the subsidiary manage or direct activities at the subsidiary’s facility. For example, the court notes that there is some evidence suggesting that an agent of the parent company engaged in activities at the subsidiary’s plant that were outside accepted norms of parental oversight. If an officer or director’s actions deviate significantly from these norms, it may indicate that they are directly involved in the facility’s operations, potentially leading to direct liability under CERCLA. Conversely, if their actions align closely with typical parental oversight, it may suggest that they are not directly involved in the facility’s operations, reducing the likelihood of direct liability."

That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed, \nthe entire agreement is silent as to the effect the formation of the projected corporation would have upon \nthe personal liability of Jenofsky and Graziano. Because the agreement fails to provide expressly for the \nrelease of personal liability, it is, therefore, subject to more than one possible construction. \n \nIn Consolidated Tile and Slate Co. v. Fox, 410 Pa. 336,339,189 A.2d 228, 229 (1963), we stated that where \nan agreement is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, “it must be construed most \nstrongly against those who drew it.”…Instantly, the chancellor determined that the intent of the parties to \nthe agreement was to hold Jenofsky personally responsible until such time as a corporate entity was \nformed and until such time as that corporate entity adopted the agreement. We believe this construction \nrepresents the only rational and prudent interpretation of the parties’ intent. \n \nAs found by the court below, this agreement was entered into on the financial strength of Jenofsky and \nGraziano, alone as individuals. Therefore, it would have been illogical for RKO to have consented to the \nrelease of their personal liability upon the mere formation of a resultant corporation prior to closing. For \nit is a well-settled rule that a contract made by a promoter, even though made for and in the name of a \nproposed corporation, in the absence of a subsequent adoption (either expressly or impliedly) by the \ncorporation, will not be binding upon the corporation. If, as Jenofsky contends, the intent was to release \npersonal responsibility upon the mere incorporation prior to closing, the effect of the agreement would \nhave been to create the possibility that RKO, in the event of non-performance, would be able to hold no \nparty accountable: there being no guarantee that the resultant corporation would ratify the agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n621 \nWithout express language in the agreement indicating that such was the intention of the parties, we may \nnot attribute this intention to them. \n \nTherefore, we hold that the intent of the parties in entering into this agreement was to have Jenofsky and \nGraziano personally liable until such time as the intended corporation was formed and ratified the \nagreement.

However, this does not mean that courts will always interpret ambiguities in favor of the drafter; instead, they aim to find the most reasonable interpretation of the parties' intentions. In the context of the case discussed, the court found that the agreement was ambiguous regarding the release of personal liability and concluded that the parties intended for the promoters to remain personally liable until the corporation ratified the agreement. This interpretation aligns with the well-established legal principle that a promoter’s contract for a proposed corporation is not binding unless the corporation subsequently adopts it, either expressly or impliedly."

Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do \nnot want to avail themselves of these financing options. Instead, they seek to raise funds through \nprivate equity, which involves private investors providing funds to a company in exchange for an \ninterest in the company.

Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off. Private equity investors may demand a significant interest in the firm, or a high return, \nto compensate them for the riskiness of their investment.

Review the advantages and disadvantages to the corporation of issuing bonds. \n \n \nBasics of Corporate Bonds \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n634 \nCorporations often raise money through debt. This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration. There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. In \nbankruptcy, the bondholders have a liquidation preference over investors with ownership—that is, the \nshareholders. Additionally, being highly leveraged can be risky: a corporation could load itself up with too \nmuch debt and not be able to make its interest payments or face-value payments. Another major \nconsideration is the “cost” of debt. When interest rates are high, corporations must offer higher interest \nrates to attract investors. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations often raise capital and finance operations through debt. Bank loans are one source of debt, but \nlarge corporations often turn to bonds for financing. Bonds are an IOU, whereby the corporation sells a bond \nto an investor; agrees to make periodic interest payments, such as 5 percent of the face value of the bond \nannually; and at the maturity date, pays the face value of the bond to the investor. There are several \nadvantages to the corporation in using bonds as a financial instrument: the corporation does not give up \nownership in the firm, it attracts more investors, it increases its flexibility, and it can deduct the interest \npayments from corporate taxes. Bonds do have some disadvantages: they are debt and can hurt a highly \nleveraged company, the corporation must pay the interest and principal when they are due, and the \nbondholders have a preference over shareholders upon liquidation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Be familiar with the basic terminology of corporate stock. \n3. Discuss preferred shares and the rights of preferred shareholders. \n4. Compare common stock with preferred stock. \n5. Describe treasury stock, and explain its function. \n6. Analyze whether debt or equity is a better financing option. \n \n \nStocks, or shares, represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Traditionally, stock was the original \ncapital paid into a business by its founders. This stock was then divided into shares, or fractional \nownership of the stock. In modern usage, the two terms are used interchangeably, as we will do here. \nShares in closely held corporations are often identical: each share of stock in BCT Bookstore, Inc. carries \nwith it the same right to vote, to receive dividends, and to receive a distribution of the net assets of the \ncompany upon liquidation. Many large corporations do not present so simple a picture. Large \ncorporations may have many different types of stock: different classes of common stock, preferred stock, \nstock with par value and no-par stock, voting and nonvoting stock, outstanding stock, and treasury stock. \nTo find out which types of stock a company has issued, look at the shareholders’ (or stockholders’) equity \nsection of the company’s balance sheet. \n \nAuthorized, Issued, and Outstanding Stock \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n637 \nStocks have different designations depending on who holds them. The articles of incorporation spell out \nhow many shares of stock the corporation may issue: these are its authorized shares. The corporation \nis not obliged to issue all authorized shares, but it may not issue more than the total without amending the \narticles of incorporation. The total of stock sold to investors is the issued stock of the corporation; the \nissued stock in the hands of all shareholders is called outstanding stock. \n \nPar Value and No-Par Stock \nPar value is the face value of stock. Par value, though, is not the market value; it is a value placed on the \nstock by the corporation but has little to do with the buying and selling value of that stock on the open \nmarket. \n \nWhen a value is specified on a stock certificate, it is said to be par value. Par value is established in the \narticles of incorporation and is the floor price of the stock; the corporation may not accept less than par \nvalue for the stock. \n \nCompanies in most states can also issue no-par shares. No-par stock may be sold for whatever price is set \nby the board of directors or by the market—unless the shareholders themselves are empowered to \nestablish the price. But many states permit (and some states require) no-par stock to have a stated value. \nCorporations issue no-par stock to reduce their exposure to liability: if the par value is greater than the \nmarket value, the corporation may be liable for that difference. \n \nOnce the universal practice, issuance of par value common stock is now limited. However, preferred stock \nusually has a par value, which is useful in determining dividend and liquidation rights. \n \nThe term stated capital describes the sum of the par value of the issued par value stock and the \nconsideration received (or stated value) for the no-par stock. The excess of net assets of a corporation over \nstated capital is its surplus. Surplus is divided into earned surplus (essentially the company’s retained \nearnings) and capital surplus (all surpluses other than earned surplus). We will return to these concepts in \nour discussion of dividends. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n638 \n \nPreferred Stock \nThe term preferred has no set legal meaning, but shareholders of preferred stock often have different \nrights than shareholders of common stock. Holders of preferred stock must look to the articles of \nincorporation to find out what their rights are. Preferred stock has elements of both stock (equity) and \nbonds (debt). Thus corporations issue preferred stock to attract more conservative investors: common",

                    "question": "What are the key differences between bonds and stocks in terms of ownership and risk?",
                    "answer": "Bonds and stocks represent different forms of investment and financial instruments with distinct characteristics. Bonds are debt instruments where an investor lends money to a corporation or government entity in exchange for regular interest payments and repayment of the principal amount at maturity. This arrangement means that bondholders are creditors and do not have ownership stakes in the issuing entity. On the other hand, stocks, or shares, are equity instruments representing ownership in a corporation. Shareholders own a portion of the company and have voting rights and the potential for dividend income. However, unlike bondholders, shareholders bear the risk of losing their entire investment if the company fails. Therefore, while bonds provide a more secure, fixed-income investment with lower risk, stocks offer higher potential returns but come with increased volatility and risk of loss."

                    "answer": "Par value and no-par stock are two distinct ways companies can structure their stock offerings. Par value refers to the nominal or face value assigned to a stock by the corporation, which is often stated on the stock certificate. While this par value serves as a minimum price for the stock, it does not necessarily reflect its market value. Companies typically issue par value stock to avoid potential liability if the market value falls below the par value, as they cannot sell the stock for less than its par value. Conversely, no-par stock does not have a stated value and can be sold for any price determined by the board of directors or the market. No-par stock may be chosen by companies looking to simplify their capital structure, reduce administrative costs, and potentially avoid the legal and financial complexities associated with par value stock."

Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646 \nThe majority of states follow the good-faith rule. As noted near the end of the United Steel \nIndustries case, in the absence of fraud, “the judgment of the board of directors ‘as to the value of \nconsideration received for shares’ is conclusive.” In other words, if the directors or shareholders conclude \nin good faith that the consideration does fairly reflect par value, then the stock is not watered and the \nstock buyer cannot be assessed for the difference. This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable. The minority approach is the true value rule: the consideration must in fact equal par \nvalue by an objective standard at the time the shares are issued, regardless of the board’s good-faith \njudgment. \n \nA shareholder may commence a derivative lawsuit (a suit by a shareholder, on behalf of the corporation, \noften filed against the corporation; see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"). In a watered \nstock lawsuit, the derivative suit is filed against a shareholder who has failed to pay full consideration \nunder either rule to recover the difference between the value received by the corporation and the par \nvalue. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations may raise funds through the sale of stock. This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. Most investors will exchange money for stock. \nCertain forms of consideration are not permitted. Finally, a corporation may be liable if it sells watered stock, \nwhere consideration received by the corporation is less than the stock par value. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

The payment date, which can be a month or more after the record date, is when the actual dividend is distributed to these shareholders.

The corporation itself has powers, although \nwith limitations. There is a division of power between shareholders, directors, and officers. Given \nthis division of power, certain duties are owed amongst the parties. We focus this chapter upon these \npowers and upon the duties owed by shareholders, directors, and officers. In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3.

                    "answer": "When deciding how to raise funds, corporations face multiple factors that need careful consideration. Each financing option comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on various internal and external factors. For instance, issuing stocks through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) can provide substantial capital but may dilute ownership and expose the company to market scrutiny. On the other hand, selling bonds can offer more stable financing but involves higher interest payments and strict compliance requirements. Preferred stock offers a middle ground, providing fixed income and priority over common stock in case of liquidation, yet it also carries specific regulatory constraints. Beyond these financial implications, corporations must also consider legal restrictions such as state laws on dividend distributions, which can limit the amount of money available for raising capital. Additionally, the strategic goals of the company, such as maintaining control, attracting investors, or expanding rapidly, should guide the decision-making process. Furthermore, the cost of capital, market conditions, and the company's creditworthiness are crucial factors that influence the choice of financing method. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of these factors is essential for making informed decisions about raising funds."

Timely notice \nis required: not more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the meeting, under Section 7.05 of the \nRevised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA). Shareholders may take actions without a meeting if \nevery shareholder entitled to vote consents in writing to the action to be taken. This option is obviously \nuseful to the closely held corporation but not to the giant publicly held companies. \n \nRight to Vote \nWho Has the Right to Vote? \nThrough its bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors, a corporation can set a “record date.” Only \nthe shareholders listed on the corporate records on that date receive notice of the next shareholders’ \nmeeting and have the right to vote. Every share is entitled to one vote unless the articles of incorporation \nstate otherwise. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n674 \n \nThe one-share, one-vote principle, commonly called regular voting or statutory voting, is not required, \nand many US companies have restructured their voting rights in an effort to repel corporate raiders. For \ninstance, a company might decide to issue both voting and nonvoting shares (as we discussed in Chapter \n16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"), with the voting shares going to insiders who thereby control \nthe corporation. In response to these new corporate structures, the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) adopted a one-share, one-vote rule in 1988 that was designed to protect a shareholder’s right to \nvote. In 1990, however, a federal appeals court overturned the SEC rule on the grounds that voting rights \nare governed by state law rather than by federal law. [1] \n \nQuorum \nWhen the articles of incorporation are silent, a shareholder quorum is a simple majority of the shares \nentitled to vote, whether represented in person or by proxy, according to RMBCA Section 7.25. Thus if \nthere are 1 million shares, 500,001 must be represented at the shareholder meeting. A simple majority of \nthose represented shares is sufficient to carry any motion, so 250,001 shares are enough to decide upon a \nmatter other than the election of directors (governed by RMBCA, Section 7.28). The articles of \nincorporation may decree a different quorum but not less than one-third of the total shares entitled to \nvote. \n \nCumulative Voting \nCumulative voting means that a shareholder may distribute his total votes in any manner that he \nchooses—all for one candidate or several shares for different candidates. With cumulative voting, each \nshareholder has a total number of votes equal to the number of shares he owns multiplied by the number \nof directors to be elected. Thus if a shareholder has 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, \nthe shareholder has 5,000 votes, and he may vote those shares in a manner he desires (all for one \ndirector, or 2,500 each for two directors, etc.). Some states permit this right unless the articles of \nincorporation deny it. Other states deny it unless the articles of incorporation permit it. Several states \nhave constitutional provisions requiring cumulative voting for corporate directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n675 \nCumulative voting is meant to provide minority shareholders with representation on the board. Assume \nthat Bob and Carol each owns 2,000 shares, which they have decided to vote as a block, and Ted owns \n6,000 shares. At their annual shareholder meeting, they are to elect five directors. Without cumulative \nvoting, Ted’s slate of directors would win: under statutory voting, each share represents one vote available \nfor each director position. With this method, by placing as many votes as possible for each director, Ted \ncould cast 6,000 votes for each of his desired directors. Thus each of Ted’s directors would receive 6,000 \nvotes, while each of Bob and Carol’s directors would receive only 4,000. Under cumulative voting, \nhowever, each shareholder has as many votes as there are directors to be elected. Hence with cumulative \nvoting Bob and Carol could strategically distribute their 20,000 votes (4,000 votes multiplied by five \ndirectors) among the candidates to ensure representation on the board. By placing 10,000 votes each on \ntwo of their candidates, they would be guaranteed two positions on the board. (The candidates from the \ntwo slates are not matched against each other on a one-to-one basis; instead, the five candidates with the \nhighest number of votes are elected.) Various formulas and computer programs are available to determine \nhow votes should be allocated, but the principle underlying the calculations is this: cumulative voting is \ndemocratic in that it allows the shareholders who own 40 percent of the stock—Bob and Carol—to elect 40 \npercent of the board. \n \nRMBCA Section 8.08 provides a safeguard against attempts to remove directors. Ordinarily, a director \nmay be removed by a majority vote of the shareholders. Cumulative voting will not aid a given single",

                    "answer": "Timely notice for a shareholders' meeting is required under Section 7.05 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), which stipulates that notice should not be more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the meeting. This requirement ensures that all shareholders have adequate time to prepare for and attend the meeting. For closely held corporations, this provision is particularly useful because these companies often rely on informal communication and may not have as formalized a process for meetings. In contrast, giant publicly held companies typically have more structured and frequent meetings, and thus the specific timeline for notice may not be as critical to them. However, the principle of providing reasonable notice still applies to ensure that all shareholders are informed and can participate if they choose to do so."

                    "question": "How does cumulative voting work and what is its purpose in a corporate setting?",
                    "answer": "Cumulative voting is a system that allows shareholders to distribute their total votes among the candidates for election in any manner they see fit. Specifically, each shareholder's total votes are equal to the number of shares they own multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. For example, if a shareholder owns 1,000 shares and there are five directors to be elected, the shareholder has 5,000 votes that can be distributed among the candidates. This system aims to provide minority shareholders with greater representation on the board by allowing them to pool their votes strategically. Without cumulative voting, a large shareholder could easily dominate the election, as seen in the example where Ted, owning 6,000 shares, could secure all five director positions if he used the statutory voting method. However, with cumulative voting, Bob and Carol, each owning 2,000 shares, could ensure that they get two seats on the board by allocating their votes effectively. This democratic approach ensures that the percentage of stock owned corresponds to the percentage of board representation, making the system fairer for minority shareholders."

            "chunk": "Section 8.03 of the RMBCA provides that there must be one director, but there may be more, the precise \nnumber to be fixed in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors. In that case, if the articles of incorporation \nso provide, the board may be divided into two or three roughly equal classes and their terms staggered, so \nthat the second class is elected at the second annual meeting and the third at the third annual meeting. A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers. They must exercise these powers with good faith. Certain decisions \nmay be delegated to a committee or to corporate officers. There must be at least one director, and directors",

What are the fiduciary duties required of a director? What measuring comparison is used to evaluate \nwhether a director is meeting these fiduciary duties? \n2.

Examine the fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers. \n2. Consider constituency statutes. \n3. Discuss modern trends in corporate compliance and fiduciary duties. \nNature of the Problem \nNot so long ago, boards of directors of large companies were quiescent bodies, virtual rubber stamps for \ntheir friends among management who put them there. By the late 1970s, with the general increase in the \nclimate of litigiousness, one out of every nine companies on the Fortune 500 list saw its directors or \nofficers hit with claims for violation of their legal responsibilities. [1] In a seminal case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court found that the directors of TransUnion were grossly negligent in accepting a buyout price \nof $55 per share without sufficient inquiry or advice on the adequacy of the price, a breach of their duty of \ncare owed to the shareholders. The directors were held liable for $23.5 million for this breach. [2] Thus \nserving as a director or an officer was never free of business risks. Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty. When there is a conflict between a director’s personal interest and the interest of the \ncorporation, he is legally bound to put the corporation’s interest above his own. This duty was mentioned \nin Exercise 3 of Section 16.2 \"Rights of Shareholders\" when Ted usurped a corporate opportunity and will \nbe discussed later in this section. \n \nFigure 16.3 Common Conflict Situations \n \n \n \nTwo situations commonly give rise to the director or officer’s duty of loyalty: (1) contracts with the \ncorporation and (2) corporate opportunity (see Figure 16.3 \"Common Conflict Situations\"). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n686 \nContracts with the Corporation \nThe law does not bar a director from contracting with the corporation he serves. However, unless the \ncontract or transaction is “fair to the corporation,” Sections 8.61, 8.62, and 8.63 of the Revised Model \nBusiness Corporation Act (RMBCA) impose on him a stringent duty of disclosure. In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the",

Over time, courts and legislatures have both narrowed and expanded the scope of these duties. For instance, the duty of care has been refined through cases like Caremark, which established specific tests for breaches of this duty. Moreover, other duties such as the duty of good faith and candor have also been developed. This evolution reflects the increasing complexity of corporate governance and the need to ensure that directors and officers act in the best interests of the corporation and its stakeholders."

This means that even if a hostile bidder gains control of a significant portion of the company's shares, they cannot immediately replace all directors. Instead, they would need to wait until the next scheduled election, giving the incumbent directors more time to resist the takeover attempt. This mechanism provides a strategic advantage to the existing management and board, as it limits the immediate impact of a hostile bid and allows them to continue making decisions that benefit the company in the long term."

The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations \nbecause it was the wrong decision, than a situation in which time was not of the essence. \n \nWhat of the care itself? What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

This means that directors are generally protected from judicial interference when they act in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.

Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation. Other groups—\nemployees, local communities and neighbors, customers, suppliers, and creditors—took a back seat to this \nprimary responsibility of directors. Of course, directors could consider the welfare of these other groups if \nin so doing they promoted the interests of shareholders. But directors were not legally permitted to favor \nthe interests of others over shareholders. The prevailing rule was, and often still is, that maximizing \nshareholder value is the primary duty of the board. Thus in Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews & Forbes \nHoldings, Inc., [16] the Delaware Supreme Court held that Revlon’s directors had breached their fiduciary \nduty to the company’s shareholders in response to a hostile tender offer from Pantry Pride. While the facts \nof the case are intricate, the general gist is that the Revlon directors thwarted the hostile tender by \nadopting a variation of a poison pill involving a tender offer for their own shares in exchange for debt, \neffectively eliminating Pantry Pride’s ability to take over the firm. Pantry Pride upped its offer price, and \nin response, Revlon began negotiating with a leveraged buyout by a third party, Forstmann Little. Pantry \nPride publicly announced it would top any bid made by Forstmann Little. Despite this, the Revlon board \nnegotiated a deal with Forstmann Little. The court noted an exception to the general rule that permitted \ndirectors to consider the interests of other groups as long as “there are rationally related benefits accruing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n692 \nto the stockholders.” But when a company is about to be taken over, the object must be to sell it to the \nhighest bidder, Pantry Pride in this case. It is then, said the court, in situations where the corporation is to \nbe sold, that “concern for nonstockholder interests is inappropriate,” thus giving rise to what are \ncommonly called the Revlon duties. \n \nPost-Revlon, in response to a wave of takeovers in the late 1980s, some states have enacted laws to give \ndirectors legal authority to take account of interests other than those of shareholders in deciding how to \ndefend against hostile mergers and acquisitions. These laws are known as constituency statutes, \nbecause they permit directors to take account of the interests of other constituencies of corporations. \nThese do not permit a corporation to avoid its Revlon duties (that when a corporation is up for sale, it \nmust be sold to the highest bidder) but will allow a corporation to consider factors other than shareholder \nvalue in determining whether to make charitable donations or reinvest profits. This ability has been \nfurther expanding as the concept of corporate social responsibility has grown, as discussed later in this \nsection. \n \nAlthough the other constituency statutes are not identically worded, they are all designed to release \ndirectors from their formal legal obligation to keep paramount the interests of shareholders. The \nPennsylvania and Indiana statutes make this clear; statutes in other states are worded a bit more \nambiguously, but the intent of the legislatures in enacting these laws seems clear: directors may give voice \nto employees worried about the loss of jobs or to communities worried about the possibility that an out-\nof-state acquiring company may close down a local factory to the detriment of the local economy. So \nbroadly worded are these laws that although the motive for enacting them was to give directors a weapon \nin fighting hostile tender offers, in some states the principle applies to any decision by a board of \ndirectors. So, for example, it is possible that a board might legally decide to give a large charitable grant to \na local community—a grant so large that it would materially decrease an annual dividend, contrary to the \ngeneral rule that at some point the interests of shareholders in dividends clearly outweighs the board’s \npower to spend corporate profits on “good works.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n693 \nCritics have attacked the constituency statutes on two major grounds: first, they substitute a clear \nprinciple of conduct for an amorphous one, because they give no guidance on how directors are supposed \nto weigh the interests of a corporation’s various constituencies.

For a more complete discussion of constituency statutes, see \n“Corporate Governance and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act: Corporate Constituency Statutes and Employee \nGovernance.” [17] \n \nMany modern corporations have begun to promote socially responsible behavior. While dumping toxic \nwaste out the back door of the manufacturing facility rather than expending funds to properly dispose of \nthe waste may result in an increase in value, the consequences of dumping the waste can be quite severe, \nwhether from fines from regulatory authorities or from public backlash. Corporate social responsibility \nresults from internal corporate policies that attempt to self-regulate and fulfill legal, ethical, and social \nobligations. Thus under corporate social responsibility, corporations may make donations to charitable \norganizations or build environmentally friendly or energy-efficient buildings. Socially irresponsible \nbehavior can be quite disastrous for a corporation. Nike, for example, was hit by consumer backlash due \nto its use of child labor in other countries, such as India and Malaysia. British Petroleum (BP) faced public \nanger as well as fines and lawsuits for a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This spill had serious \nconsequences for BP’s shareholders—BP stopped paying dividends, its stock price plummeted, and it had \nto set aside significant amounts of money to compensate injured individuals and businesses. \nMany businesses try to fulfill what is commonly called the triple bottom line, which is a focus on profits, \npeople, and the planet. For example, Ben and Jerry’s, the ice cream manufacturer, had followed a triple \nbottom line practice for many years. Nonetheless, when Ben and Jerry’s found itself the desired \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n694 \nacquisition of several other businesses, it feared that a takeover of the firm would remove this focus, since \nfor some firms, there is only one bottom line—profits. Unilever offered $43.60 per share for Ben and \nJerry’s. Several Ben and Jerry’s insiders made a counteroffer at $38 per share, arguing that a lower price \nwas justified given the firm’s focus. Ultimately, in a case like this, the Revlon duties come into play: when \na corporation is for sale, corporate social responsibility goes out the window and only one bottom line \nexists—maximum shareholder value. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, the company was acquired in 2000 \nfor $326 million by Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch corporation that is the world’s largest consumer products \ncompany. \n \nSarbanes-Oxley and Other Modern Trends \nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted following several accounting scandals, strengthens the duties \nowed by the board and other corporate officers. In particular, Title III contains corporate responsibility \nprovisions, such as requiring senior executives to vouch for the accuracy and completeness of their \ncorporation’s financial disclosures. While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in",

A vehicle is needed to \naddress such violations doctrinally, and that doctrinal vehicle is the duty to act in good faith. The \nChancellor implicitly so recognized in his Opinion, where he identified different examples of bad faith as \nfollows: \n \nThe good faith required of a corporate fiduciary includes not simply the duties of care and loyalty, in the \nnarrow sense that I have discussed them above, but all actions required by a true faithfulness and \ndevotion to the interests of the corporation and its shareholders. A failure to act in good faith may be \nshown, for instance, where the fiduciary intentionally acts with a purpose other than that of advancing the \nbest interests of the corporation, where the fiduciary acts with the intent to violate applicable positive law, \nor where the fiduciary intentionally fails to act in the face of a known duty to act, demonstrating a \nconscious disregard for his duties. There may be other examples of bad faith yet to be proven or alleged, \nbut these three are the most salient. \n \n…Second, the legislature has also recognized this intermediate category of fiduciary misconduct, which \nranks between conduct involving subjective bad faith and gross negligence. Section 102(b)(7)(ii) of the \nDGCL expressly denies money damage exculpation for “acts or omissions not in good faith or which \ninvolve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law.” By its very terms that provision \ndistinguishes between “intentional misconduct” and a “knowing violation of law” (both examples of \nsubjective bad faith) on the one hand, and “acts…not in good faith,” on the other. Because the statute \nexculpates directors only for conduct amounting to gross negligence, the statutory denial of exculpation \nfor “acts…not in good faith” must encompass the intermediate category of misconduct captured by the \nChancellor’s definition of bad faith. \n \nFor these reasons, we uphold the Court of Chancery’s definition as a legally appropriate, although not the \nexclusive, definition of fiduciary bad faith. We need go no further. To engage in an effort to craft (in the \nCourt’s words) “a definitive and categorical definition of the universe of acts that would constitute bad \nfaith” would be unwise and is unnecessary to dispose of the issues presented on this appeal.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n708 \n \nFor the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Chancery is affirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

What two statutory provisions has the Delaware General Assembly passed that address the distinction \nbetween bad faith and a failure to exercise due care (i.e., gross negligence)? \n \n \n \n \n16.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA corporation may exercise two types of powers: (1) express powers, set forth by statute and in the articles \nof incorporation, and (2) implied powers, necessary to carry out its stated purpose. The corporation may \nalways amend the articles of incorporation to change its purposes. Nevertheless, shareholders may enjoin \ntheir corporation from acting ultra vires, as may the state attorney general. However, an individual \nstockholder, director, or officer (except in rare instances under certain regulatory statutes) may not be \nheld vicariously liable if he did not participate in the crime or tort. \n \nBecause ownership and control are separated in the modern publicly held corporation, shareholders \ngenerally do not make business decisions. Shareholders who own voting stock do retain the power to elect \ndirectors, amend the bylaws, ratify or reject certain corporate actions, and vote on certain extraordinary \nmatters, such as whether to amend the articles of incorporation, merge, or liquidate. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n709 \nIn voting for directors, various voting methodologies may be used, such as cumulative voting, which \nprovides safeguards against removal of minority-shareholder-supported directors. Shareholders may use \nseveral voting arrangements that concentrate power, including proxies, voting agreements, and voting \ntrusts. Proxies are regulated under rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n \nCorporations may deny preemptive rights—the rights of shareholders to prevent dilution of their \npercentage of ownership—by so stating in the articles of incorporation. Some states say that in the \nabsence of such a provision, shareholders do have preemptive rights; others say that there are no \npreemptive rights unless the articles specifically include them. \n \nDirectors have the ultimate authority to run the corporation and are fiduciaries of the firm.

Securities and Exchange Commission (see Section 17.3.2 \"Tippee Liability\"), that \ntippees are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing \nconfidential information and the tipper received a personal benefit from the disclosure. \n \nThe Supreme Court has also refined Rule 10b-5 as it relates to the duty of a company to \ndisclose material information, as discussed in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to \nDisclose Material Information\"). This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v. O’Hagan, [7] and the SEC adopted the theory as \nnew Rule 10b5-2. Under this new rule, the duty of trust or confidence exists when (1) a person agrees to \nmaintain information in confidence; (2) the recipient knows or should have known through history, \npattern, or practice of sharing confidences that the person communicating the information expects \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n730 \nconfidentiality; and (3) a person received material nonpublic information from his or her spouse, parent, \nchild, or sibling. \n \nIn 1987, in Carpenter v. United States, [8] the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Wall Street \nJournal reporter who leaked advanced information about the contents of his “Heard on the Street” \ncolumn. The reporter, who was sentenced to eighteen months in prison, had been convicted on both mail \nand wire fraud and securities law charges for misappropriating information. The Court upheld the mail \nand wire fraud conviction by an 8–0 vote and the securities law conviction by a 4–4 vote. (In effect, the tie \nvote affirmed the conviction.) [9] \n \nBeyond these judge-made theories of liability, Congress had been concerned about insider trading, and in \n1984 and 1988, it substantially increased the penalties. A person convicted of insider trading now faces a \nmaximum criminal fine of $1 million and a possible ten-year prison term. A civil penalty of up to three \ntimes the profit made (or loss avoided) by insider trading can also be imposed. This penalty is in addition \nto liability for profits made through insider trading. For example, financier Ivan Boesky, who was \nsentenced in 1987 to a three-year prison term for insider trading, was required to disgorge $50 million of \nprofits and was liable for another $50 million as a civil penalty. In 2003, Martha Stewart was indicted on \ncharges of insider trading but was convicted for obstruction of justice, serving only five months. More \nrecently, in 2009, billionaire founder of the Galleon Group, Raj Rajaratnam, was arrested for insider \ntrading; he was convicted in May 2011 of all 14 counts of insider trading. For the SEC release on the \nMartha Stewart case, seehttp://www.sec.gov/news/press/2003-69.htm. \n \nCompanies that knowingly and recklessly fail to prevent insider trading by their employees are subject to \na civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided by insider trading or $1 million, \nwhichever is greater. Corporations are also subject to a criminal fine of up to $2.5 million. \n \nSecondary Actor \nIn Stoneridge Investment Partners v. Scientific-Atlanta, [10] the US Supreme Court held that “aiders and \nabettors” of fraud cannot be held secondarily liable under 10(b) for a private cause of action. This means \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n731 \nthat secondary actors, such as lawyers and accountants, cannot be held liable unless their conduct \nsatisfies all the elements for 10(b) liability. \nFor an overview of insider trading, go to http://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm.",

The takeover has become a popular method for gaining control because it does not require an \naffirmative vote by the target company’s board of directors. In a takeover, the acquiring company \nappeals directly to the target’s shareholders, offering either money or other securities, often at a premium \nover market value, in exchange for their shares. The acquiring company usually need not purchase 100 \npercent of the shares. Indeed, if the shares are numerous and widely enough dispersed, control can be \nachieved by acquiring less than half the outstanding stock.

That is impossible in \nthe case of large publicly held companies since it is impracticable and/or too expensive to reach each \nindividual shareholder. To reach all shareholders, the acquiring company must make a tender offer, which \nis a public offer to purchase shares. In fact, the tender offer is not really an offer at all in the technical \nsense; the tender offer is an invitation to shareholders to sell their shares at a stipulated price. The \ntender offer might express the price in cash or in shares of the acquiring company. Ordinarily, the offeror \nwill want to purchase only a controlling interest, so it will limit the tender to a specified number of shares \nand reserve the right not to purchase any above that number. It will also condition the tender offer on \nreceiving a minimum number of shares so that it need buy none if stockholders do not offer a threshold \nnumber of shares for purchase. \n \nLeveraged Buyouts \nA tender offer or other asset purchase can be financed as a leveraged buyout (LBO), a purchase \nfinanced by debt. A common type of LBO involves investors who are members of the target corporation \nand/or outsiders who wish to take over the target or retain a controlling interest. These purchasers use the \nassets of the target corporation, such as its real estate or a manufacturing plant, as security for a loan to \npurchase the target. The purchasers also use other types of debt, such as the issuance of bonds or a loan, \nto implement the LBO. \n \nFor more information about tender offers and mergers, see Unocal v. Mesa [3]and Revlon v. MacAndrews \n& Forbes. [4] The Wall Street Journal provides comprehensive coverage of tender offers, mergers, and \nLBOs, athttp://www.wsj.com. \n \nState versus Federal Regulation of Takeovers \nUnder the federal Williams Act, upon commencement of a tender offer for more than 5 percent of the \ntarget’s stock, the offeror must file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \nstating the source of funds to be used in making the purchase, the purpose of the purchase, and the extent \nof its holdings in the target company. Even when a tender offer has not been made, the Williams Act \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n752 \nrequires any person who acquires more than 5 percent ownership of a corporation to file a statement with \nthe SEC within ten days.

The US Constitution is also implicated \nin the regulation of foreign corporations. The Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution \nprovides that Congress has power “to regulate Commerce…among the several States.” \n \nBecause officers and directors of target companies have no legal say in whether stockholders will tender \ntheir shares, many states began, in the early 1970s, to enact takeover laws. The first generation of these \nlaws acted as delaying devices by imposing lengthy waiting periods before a tender offer could be put into \neffect. Many of the laws expressly gave management of the target companies a right to a hearing, which \ncould be dragged out for weeks or months, giving the target time to build up a defense.

However, California decisions holding \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n765 \nthat a corporation acquiring the assets of another corporation is the latter’s mere continuation and \ntherefore liable for its debts have imposed such liability only upon a showing of one or both of the \nfollowing factual elements: (1) no adequate consideration was given for the predecessor corporation’s \nassets and made available for meeting the claims of its unsecured creditors; (2) one or more persons were \nofficers, directors, or stockholders of both corporations.… \nWe therefore conclude that the general rule governing succession to liabilities does not require Alad II to \nrespond to plaintiff’s claim.… \n \n[However], we must decide whether the policies underlying strict tort liability for defective products call \nfor a special exception to the rule that would otherwise insulate the present defendant from plaintiff’s \nclaim. \n \nThe purpose of the rule of strict tort liability “is to insure that the costs of injuries resulting from defective \nproducts are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market rather than by the injured \npersons who are powerless to protect themselves.” However, the rule “does not rest on the analysis of the \nfinancial strength or bargaining power of the parties to the particular action. It rests, rather, on the \nproposition that ‘The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune \nto the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and \ndistributed among the public as a cost of doing business. (Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., 24 Cal.2d 453, \n462 [150 P.2d 436] [concurring opinion]) Thus, “the paramount policy to be promoted by the rule is the \nprotection of otherwise defenseless victims of manufacturing defects and the spreading throughout \nsociety of the cost of compensating them.” Justification for imposing strict liability upon a successor to a \nmanufacturer under the circumstances here presented rests upon (1) the virtual destruction of the \nplaintiff’s remedies against the original manufacturer caused by the successor’s acquisition of the \nbusiness, (2) the successor’s ability to assume the original manufacturer’s risk-spreading role, and (3) the \nfairness of requiring the successor to assume a responsibility for defective products that was a burden \nnecessarily attached to the original manufacturer’s good will being enjoyed by the successor in the \ncontinued operation of the business. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n766 \nWe therefore conclude that a party which acquires a manufacturing business and continues the output of \nits line of products under the circumstances here presented assumes strict tort liability for defects in units \nof the same product line previously manufactured and distributed by the entity from which the business \nwas acquired. \nThe judgment is reversed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

                    "answer": "Based on the information provided, Alad II did not need to respond to the plaintiff's claim because it did not meet the criteria set forth in the third stated ground for liability under California decisions.

Additionally, the acquisition of Alad I's assets was not in the nature of a merger or consolidation, and the consideration given was deemed adequate to meet the claims of Alad I’s creditors at the time of dissolution.

These circumstances include the virtual destruction of the plaintiff’s remedies against the original manufacturer due to the successor’s acquisition of the business, the successor’s ability to assume the original manufacturer’s risk-spreading role, and the fairness of requiring the successor to assume a responsibility for defective products that was a burden necessarily attached to the original manufacturer’s goodwill being enjoyed by the successor in the continued operation of the business. This imposition of liability aligns with the broader policy objective of protecting otherwise defenseless victims of manufacturing defects and spreading the cost of compensating them throughout society."

There are several generally recognized exceptions, such as when \nthe asset purchase is fraudulent or to avoid creditors. Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business. The \nacquiring corporation assumes the other company’s debts. Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There \nare two main types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. A consolidation is virtually the same \nas a merger, except that the resulting entity is a new corporation. \n \nA corporation may take over another company by purchasing a controlling interest of its stock, commonly \nreferred to as a takeover. This is accomplished by appealing directly to the target company’s shareholders. \nIn the case of a large publicly held corporation, the appeal is known as a tender offer, which is not an offer \nbut an invitation to shareholders to tender their stock at a stated price. A leveraged buyout involves using \nthe target corporation’s assets as security for a loan used to purchase the target. \nA shareholder has the right to fair value for his stock if he dissents from a plan to merge, consolidate, or \nsell all or substantially all of the corporate assets, referred to as appraisal rights. If there is disagreement \nover the value, the shareholder has the right to a court appraisal. When one company acquires 90 percent \nof the stock of another, it may merge with the target through a short-form merger, which eliminates the \nrequirement of consent of shareholders and the target company’s board. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n771 \nCertain federal regulations are implicated in corporate expansion, particularly the Williams Act. States \nmay impose conditions on admission of a foreign corporation to do business of a purely local nature but \nnot if its business is exclusively interstate in character, which would violate the Commerce Clause. Among \nthe requirements are obtaining a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and maintaining a \nregistered office with a registered agent. But certain activities do not constitute doing business, such as \nfiling lawsuits and collecting debts, and may be carried on even if the corporation is not licensed to do \nbusiness in a state. Under long-arm statutes, state courts have jurisdiction over foreign corporations as \nlong as the corporations have minimum contacts in the state. States may also tax corporate activities as \nlong as the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce. \n \nDissolution is the legal termination of a corporation’s existence, as distinguished from liquidation, the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. A corporation may be dissolved by shareholders if they \nunanimously agree in writing, or by majority vote of the directors and shareholders. A corporation may \nalso be dissolved involuntarily on one of five grounds, including failure to file an annual report or to pay \ntaxes. Shareholders may sue for judicial liquidation on a showing that corporate assets are being wasted \nor directors or officers are acting illegally or fraudulently. \n \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Why commercial paper is important in modern economic systems \n2. How the law of commercial paper has developed over the past four hundred years, and what role it plays \nin economics and finance \n3. What the types of commercial paper are, and who the parties to such paper are \n4. What is required for paper to be negotiable \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n774 \n \n \nHere we begin our examination of commercial paper, documents representing an obligation by one \nparty to pay another money. You are familiar with one kind of commercial paper: a check. \n \n \n19.1 Introduction to Commercial Paper \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand why commercial paper is an important concept in modern finance. \n2. Be familiar with the historical development of commercial paper. \n3. Recognize how commercial paper is viewed in economics and finance. \n \n \n \n \nThe Importance of Commercial Paper \nBecause commercial paper is a vital invention for the working of our economic system, brief attention to \nits history and its function as a medium of exchange in economics and finance is appropriate. \n \nThe Central Role of Commercial Paper \nCommercial paper is the collective term for various financial instruments, or tools, that include checks \ndrawn on commercial banks, drafts (drawn on something other than a bank), certificates of deposit, and \nnotes evidencing a promise to pay. Like money, commercial paper is a medium of exchange, but because it \nis one step removed from money, difficulties arise that require a series of interlocking rules to protect \nboth sellers and buyers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n775 \nTo understand the importance of commercial paper, consider the following example. It illustrates a \ndistinction that is critical to the discussion in our four chapters on commercial paper. \n \nLorna Love runs a tennis club. She orders a truckload of new tennis rackets from Rackets, Inc., a \nmanufacturer. The contract price of the rackets is $100,000. Rackets ships the rackets to Love. Rackets \nthen sells for $90,000 its contract rights (rights to receive the payment from Love of $100,000) to First \nBank (see Figure 19.1 \"Assignment of Contract Rights\"). Unfortunately, the rackets that arrive at Love’s \nare warped and thus commercially worthless. Rackets files for bankruptcy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 19.1 Assignment of Contract Rights \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n776 \nMay the bank collect from Love $100,000, the value of the contract rights it purchased? No. Under the \n“shoe rule” an assignee—here, the bank—steps into the shoes of the assignor and takes the assigned rights \nsubject to any defense of the obligor, Love. (Here, of course, Love’s defense against paying is that the \nrackets are worthless.) The result would be the same if Love had given Rackets a nonnegotiable note, \nwhich Rackets proceeded to sell to the bank. (By nonnegotiable we do not mean that the note cannot be \nsold but only that certain legal requirements, discussed in Section 19.3 \"Requirements for \nNegotiability\" of this chapter, have not been met.) \n \nNow let us add one fact: In addition to signing a contract, Love gives Rackets a negotiable note in \nexchange for the rackets, and Rackets sells the note to the bank. By adding that the note is negotiable, the",

                    "answer": "For the bus driver to enforce his rights against the Ohio corporation that manufactured the bus seat, he would need to follow the legal procedures for serving process on the corporation. Given that the Ohio corporation did not have an office in Massachusetts but occasionally sent a sales representative there and delivered parts to the state, the corporation likely has sufficient minimum contacts with Massachusetts to be subject to the jurisdiction of its courts under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Therefore, if process was properly served on the company at its Ohio office, a Massachusetts court would have jurisdiction over the Ohio corporation. The next step would involve filing a lawsuit in a Massachusetts court and adhering to the procedural rules for bringing a case to trial, including discovery, motions, and ultimately, if necessary, a trial where evidence would be presented and a verdict rendered."

Commercial paper includes financial instruments like checks drawn on commercial banks, drafts, certificates of deposit, and notes evidencing a promise to pay. This significance arises because commercial paper allows for the transfer of value without the immediate need for cash, facilitating transactions and trade. It is crucial in modern finance because it enables businesses and individuals to manage their finances more efficiently and securely, supporting the liquidity and flexibility needed in today's complex economic environment."

It then forwards \nthe draft, bill of lading, and other papers to a correspondent bank in New York, which in turn presents it \nto Love’s bank. If the papers are in order, Love’s bank will “accept” the draft (sign it). The signed draft is \nthe banker’s acceptance (see Figure 19.3 \"A Time Draft\"). It is returned to the bank in Taiwan, which can \nthen discount the banker’s acceptance if it wishes payment immediately or else wait the ninety days to \npresent it to the New York bank for payment. After remitting to the Taiwanese bank, the New York bank \nthen demands payment from Love. \n \nChecks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n786 \nA second type of commercial paper is the common bank check, a special form of draft. Section 3-104(2)(b) \nof the UCC defines a check as “a draft drawn on a bank and payable on demand.” Postdating a check \n(putting in a future date) does not invalidate it or change its character as payable on demand. Postdating \nsimply changes the first time at which the payee may demand payment. Checks are, of course, usually \nwritten on paper forms, but a check can be written on anything—a door, a shirt, a rock—though certainly \nthe would-be holder is not obligated to accept it. \n \nLike drafts, checks may be accepted by the drawee bank. Bank acceptance of a check is \ncalled certification; the check is said to be certified by stamping the word “certified” on the face of the \ncheck. When the check is certified, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. It can \noffer this guarantee because it removes from the drawer’s account the face amount of the check and holds \nit for payment. The payee may demand payment from the bank but not from the drawer or any prior \nindorser of the check. \nA certified check is distinct from a cashier’s check. A cashier’s check is drawn on the account of the \nbank itself and signed by an authorized bank representative in return for a cash payment to it from the \ncustomer. The bank guarantees payment of the cashier’s check also. \n \nNotes \nA note—often called a promissory note—is a written promise to pay a specified sum of money on \ndemand or at a definite time. There are two parties to a note: the maker (promisor), and \nthe payee (promisee). For an example of a promissory note, see Figure 19.4 \"A Promissory Note\". The \nmaker might execute a promissory note in return for a money loan from a bank or other financial \ninstitution or in return for the opportunity to make a purchase on credit. \n \nFigure 19.4 A Promissory Note \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n787 \n \n \nCertificates of Deposit \nA fourth type of commercial paper is the certificate of deposit, commonly called a CD. The CD is a \nwritten acknowledgment by a bank that it has received money and agrees to repay it at a time specified in \nthe certificate. The first negotiable CD was issued in 1961 by First National City Bank of New York (now \nCitibank); it was designed to compete for corporate cash that companies were investing in Treasury notes \nand other funds. Because CDs are negotiable, they can be traded easily if the holder wants cash, though \ntheir price fluctuates with the market. \n \n \nOther Parties to Commercial Paper \nIn addition to makers, drawees, and payees, there are five other capacities in which one can deal with \ncommercial paper. \n \nIndorser and Indorsee \nThe indorser (also spelled endorser) is one who transfers ownership of a negotiable instrument by \nsigning it. A depositor indorses a check when presenting it for deposit by signing it on the back. The bank \ndeposits its own funds, in the amount of the check, to the depositor’s account. By indorsing it, the \ndepositor transfers ownership of the check to the bank. The depositor’s bank then can present it to the \ndrawer’s bank for repayment from the drawer’s funds. The indorsee is the one to whom a draft or note is \nindorsed. When a check is deposited in a bank, the bank is the indorsee. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n788 \nHolder \nA holder is “a person in possession of a negotiable that is payable either to bearer, or to an identified \nperson that is the person in possession.” [2] Holder is thus a generic term that embraces several of the \nspecific types of parties already mentioned. An indorsee and a drawee can be holders. But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to",

Subsequently, the bank forwards the draft, bill of lading, and other relevant documents to a correspondent bank located in New York. This correspondent bank then presents these documents to the seller's bank. Should the documents be in order, the seller's bank will 'accept' the draft by signing it. The signed draft, known as the banker's acceptance, is then sent back to the bank in Taiwan. At this point, the Taiwanese bank has the option to discount the banker's acceptance, meaning they can receive immediate payment or hold onto it for the ninety-day period during which it can be presented to the New York bank for payment."

A check is essentially a draft drawn on a bank and payable upon demand, whereas a banker's acceptance is a signed draft that represents a commitment from a bank to pay a specified amount at a later date. When a check is certified by the drawee bank, the bank guarantees that it will honor the check when presented. This guarantee is achieved by the bank removing the face amount of the check from the drawer's account and holding it for payment. In contrast, the drawer or any prior indorser cannot be demanded payment from when a check is certified. On the other hand, the payee can only demand payment from the bank that certified the check. Additionally, a certified check is distinct from a cashier's check, which is drawn on the bank's own account and guaranteed by an authorized bank representative who signs it in exchange for a cash payment from the customer."

The plaintiff \nBank was not a holder in due course, therefore, the defendant was entitled to raise against the plaintiff \nany defenses which could be raised between the appellant and Rogers and Blythe.

                    "answer": "The promissory note was made non-negotiable because it incorporated the terms of the mortgage by stating 'the terms of said mortgage are by this reference made a part hereof.' This means that the note was not an unconditional promise to pay, as it referenced another writing (the mortgage), which rendered it non-negotiable under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). As a result, the plaintiff bank, which was not a holder in due course, was not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law since the defendant could raise any defenses available against the mortgagee, including an affirmative defense of fraud. Therefore, the court of appeals reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings."

The case would then be remanded back to the lower court for further proceedings, allowing the defendant to present evidence and arguments related to the fraud claim, potentially leading to a different outcome in the case."

Centerre’s petition prayed for \njudgment against the Campbells for the unpaid principal and interest. \n \n[The Campbells] aver that the note was given for the purchase of an interest in a limited partnership to be \ncreated by Strand, that no limited partnership was thereafter created by Strand, and that by reason \nthereof there was “a complete and total failure of consideration for the said promissory note.” \nConsequently, pled the answers, Centerre “should be estopped from asserting a claim against [the \nCampbells] on said promissory note because of such total failure of consideration for same.” \n \nThe cause was tried to the court, all parties having waived trial by jury. At trial, the attorney for the \nCampbells asked Curtis D. Campbell what the consideration was for the note. Centerre’s attorney \ninterrupted: “We object to any testimony as to the consideration for the note because it’s our position that \nis not a defense in this lawsuit since the bank is the holder in due course.”… \n \n \nThe trial court entered judgment in favor of Centerre and against the Campbells for $9,000, plus accrued \ninterest and costs. The trial court filed no findings of fact or conclusions of law, none having been \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n801 \nrequested. The trial court did, however, include in its judgment a finding that Centerre “is a holder in due \ncourse of the promissory note sued upon.” \n \nThe Campbells appeal, briefing four points. Their first three, taken together, present a single hypothesis of \nerror consisting of these components: (a) the Campbells showed “by clear and convincing evidence a valid \nand meritorious defense in that there existed a total lack and failure of consideration for the promissory \nnote in question,” (b) Centerre acquired the note subject to such defense in that Centerre was not a holder \nin due course, as one can be a holder in due course of a note only if the note is a negotiable instrument, \nand (c) the note was not a negotiable instrument inasmuch as “it failed to state a sum certain due the \npayee.”… \n \nWe have already noted that if Centerre is not a holder in due course, the Campbells can assert the defense \nof failure of consideration against Centerre to the same degree they could have asserted it against Strand. \nWe have also spelled out that Centerre cannot be a holder in due course if the note is not a negotiable \ninstrument. The pivotal issue, therefore, is whether the provision that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand prevents the note from being a negotiable instrument.… \n \nNeither side has cited a Missouri case applying [UCC 3-104(a)] to a note containing a provision similar to: \n“Interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand.” Our independent research has likewise proven \nfruitless. There are, however, instructive decisions from other jurisdictions. \n \nIn Taylor v. Roeder, [Citation, Virginia] (1987), a note provided for interest at “[t]hree percent (3.00%) \nover Chase Manhattan prime to be adjusted monthly.” A second note provided for interest at “3% over \nChase Manhattan prime adjusted monthly.” Applying sections of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted \nby Virginia identical to [the Missouri UCC], the court held the notes were not negotiable instruments in \nthat the amounts required to satisfy them could not be ascertained without reference to an extrinsic \nsource, the varying prime rate of interest charged by Chase Manhattan Bank. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n802 \nIn Branch Banking and Trust Co. v.

The opinion recited that for the \nrequirement of a sum certain to be met, it is necessary that at the time of payment the holder be able to \ndetermine the amount which is then payable from the instrument itself, with any necessary computation, \nwithout reference to any outside source. It is essential, said the court, for a negotiable instrument “to bear \na definite sum so that subsequent holders may take and transfer the instrument without having to plumb \nthe intricacies of the instrument’s background.… \n \nIn A. Alport & Son, Inc. v. Hotel Evans, Inc., [Citation] (1970), a note contained the notation “with \ninterest at bank rates.” Applying a section of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted by New York \nidentical to [3-104(a)] the court held the note was not a negotiable instrument in that the amount of \ninterest had to be established by facts outside the instrument. \n \nIn the instant case, the Campbells insist that it is impossible to determine from the face of the note the \namount due and payable on any payment date, as the note provides that interest may vary with bank rates \ncharged to Strand. Consequently, say the Campbells, the note is not a negotiable instrument, as it does not \ncontain a promise to pay a “sum certain” [UCC 3-104(a)]. \n \nCenterre responds that the provision that interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand is not \n“directory,” but instead is merely “discretionary.” The argument begs the question. Even if one assumes \nthat Strand would elect not to vary the interest charged the Campbells if interest rates charged Strand by \nbanks changed, a holder of the note would have to investigate such facts before determining the amount \ndue on the note at any time of payment. We hold that under 3-104 and 3-106, supra, and the authorities \ndiscussed earlier, the provision that interest may vary with bank rates charged to Strand bars the note \nfrom being a negotiable instrument, thus no assignee thereof can be a holder in due course.

First, the note provides in one place that principal and interest are to be paid in annual \ninstallments; in another place it provides that interest will be payable semiannually. Second, there is no \nacceleration clause providing that if default be made in the payment of any installment when due, then all \nremaining installments shall become due and payable immediately. It would have thus been arguable \nthat, at time of trial, only the first year’s installment of principal and interest was due.

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it. A \nmere transferee stands in the transferor’s shoes and takes the instrument subject to all the claims and \ndefenses against paying it that burdened it when the transferor delivered it. Negotiation is a special type of \ntransfer—voluntary or involuntary—to a holder. A holder is a person who has an instrument drawn, issued, or \nindorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank. If the instrument is order paper, negotiation is \naccomplished by indorsement and delivery to the next holder; if it is bearer paper or blank paper, delivery \nalone accomplishes negotiation. Transferors incur two types of liability: those who sign the instrument are \ncontractually liable; those who sign or those who do not sign are liable to the transferee in warranty. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Such an attachment is called an allonge—it comes along with the instrument \n(UCC, Section 3-204(a)). \n \nThere are rules about where indorsements are placed. The Expedited Funds Availability Act was enacted \nin 1987 by Congress to standardize holding periods on deposits made to commercial banks and to regulate \ninstitutions’ use of deposit holds—that is, how soon customers can access the money after they have \ndeposited a check in the bank. The Federal Reserve Board subsequently adopted “Regulation CC, Check \nEndorsement Standards” to improve funds availability and expedite the return of checks. See Figure 20.3 \n\"Indorsement Standard\". \n \nFigure 20.3 Indorsement Standard \n \nFrom UC Irvine Administrative Policies & Procedures, Business and Financial Affairs, Financial \nServices, Sec. 704-13: Check Endorsement Procedures, \nathttp://www.policies.uci.edu/adm/procs/700/704-13.html. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n818 \nAs shown in Figure 20.3 \"Indorsement Standard\", specific implementing guidelines define criteria for the \nplacement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank \n(bank of first deposit), subsequent indorsers (paying banks), and corporate or payee indorsers. \nIndorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; \nremaining space is for bank indorsements. There is no penalty for violating the standard—it is a guideline. \nThe abbreviation “MICR” stands for magnetic ink character recognition. The “clear band” is a section of \nthe back of the check that is not supposed to be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) \nprinting that would interfere with machine reading on the front side (the bank routing numbers). \n \nSometimes an indorser adds words intended to strengthen the indorsement; for example, “I hereby assign \nall my right, title, and interest in this note to Carl Carpenter.” Words of assignment such as these and also \nwords of condition, waiver, guaranty, limitation, or disclaimer of liability do not negate the effect of an \nindorsement. \n \nMisspelled or Incorrect Indorsements \nWhen the instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name (or in a name other than his \nown), he may indorse in the wrong name or the right one or both. It is safer to sign in both names, and the \npurchaser of the instrument may demand a signature in both names (UCC, Section 3-204(d)). \n \nVarious Indorsements and Their Effects \nA holder can indorse in a variety of ways; indorsements are not identical and have different effects. \n \nNo Indorsement \nIf the instrument requires a signature, transfer without indorsement is an assignment only. Bearer paper \ndoes not require indorsement, so it can be negotiated simply by delivering it to the transferee, who \nbecomes a holder. The transferor has no contract liability on the instrument, however, because he has not \nsigned it. He does remain liable on the warranties, but only to the person who receives the paper, not to \nsubsequent transferees. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n819 \nBecause it is common practice for a depository bank (the bank into which a person makes a deposit) to \nreceive unindorsed checks under so-called lockbox agreements from customers who receive a high volume \nof checks, a customer who is a holder can deposit a check or other instrument for credit to his account \nwithout indorsement.

                    "answer": "According to Regulation CC, indorsements must be made within 1½ inches of the trailing (left) edge of the back of the check; remaining space is for bank indorsements. This regulation defines the placement, content, and ink color of endorsement areas on the back of checks for the depositary bank, subsequent indorsers, and corporate or payee indorsers. The clear band is a section of the back of the check that is not supposed to be intruded upon with any magnetic (machine-readable) printing that would interfere with machine reading on the front side (the bank routing numbers)."

He does remain liable on the warranties, but only to the person who receives the paper, not to \nsubsequent transferees. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n819 \nBecause it is common practice for a depository bank (the bank into which a person makes a deposit) to \nreceive unindorsed checks under so-called lockbox agreements from customers who receive a high volume \nof checks, a customer who is a holder can deposit a check or other instrument for credit to his account \nwithout indorsement. Section 4-205(1) of the UCC provides that a “depositary bank becomes a holder…at \nthe time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder, whether or \nnot the customer indorses the item.” \n \nPartial Indorsement \nTo be effective as negotiation, an indorsement must convey the entire instrument. An indorsement that \npurports to convey only a portion of the sum still due amounts to a partial assignment. If Rackets’ agent \nsigns the check “Rackets, Inc.” together with the words “Pay half to City Water, /s/ Agent” and delivers \nthe check to City Water, that does not operate as an indorsement, and City Water becomes an assignee, \nnot a holder. \n \nBlank Indorsement \nA blank indorsement consists of the indorser’s signature alone (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of \nEndorsement\", left). A blank indorsement converts the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since \nthe indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—\nassuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A \npaper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it \ninto aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the \nindorsement. For example, a check indorsed by the payee (signed on the back) may be passed from one \nperson to another and cashed in by any of them. \n \nFigure 20.4 Forms of Endorsement \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n820 \nA blank indorsement creates conditional contract liability in the indorser: he is liable to pay if the paper is \ndishonored. The blank indorser also has warranty liability toward subsequent holders. \n \nSpecial Indorsement \nA special indorsement, sometimes known as an “indorsement in full,” names the transferee-holder. \nThe payee of a check can indorse it over to a third party by writing “Pay to the order of [name of the third \nparty]” and then signing his name (see Figure 20.4 \"Forms of Endorsement\", center). Once specially \nindorsed, the check (or other instrument) can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds \nhis own signature. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above \nthe signature of the indorser words of a contractual nature consistent with the character of the \ninstrument. \n \nSo, for example, Lorna Love’s check to Rackets, Inc., indorsed in blank (signed by its agent or stamped \nwith Rackets’ indorsement stamp—its name alone) and handed to City Water, is not very safe: it is bearer \npaper. If the check fell onto the floor, anybody could be a holder and cash it. It can easily be converted into \na check with special indorsement: City Water’s clerk need only add the words “Pay City Water” above \nRackets’ indorsement. (The magic words of negotiability—“pay to order of bearer”—are not required in an \nindorsement.) Before doing so, City Water could have negotiated it simply by giving it to someone (again, \na blank indorsement acts as bearer paper). After converting it to a special indorsement, City Water must \nindorse it in order to transfer it by negotiation to someone else. The liabilities of a special indorser are the \nsame as those of a blank indorser. \n \nThe dichotomy here of indorsement in blank or special indorsement is the indorser’s way of indicating \nhow the instrument can be subsequently negotiated: with or without further indorsing. \n \nRestrictive Indorsement \nA restrictive indorsement attempts to limit payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibit \nfurther transfer or negotiation. We say “attempts to limit” because a restrictive indorsement is generally \ninvalid. Section 3-206(a) of the UCC provides that an attempt to limit payment to a particular person or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n821 \nprohibit further transfer “is not effective.” Nor is “[a]n indorsement stating a condition to the right of the \nindorsee to receive payment”; the restriction may be disregarded. However, two legitimate restrictive \nindorsements are valid: collection indorsements and trust indorsements. Wisner Elevator Company, Inc. \nv. Richland State Bank (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with conditional and restrictive indorsements. \n \nCollection Indorsement \nIt is very common for people and businesses to mail checks to their bank for deposit to their accounts.",

This process transforms the check into a negotiable instrument that requires further endorsement for subsequent transfers. Before making this conversion, City Water can negotiate the check simply by giving it to someone, as a blank indorsement acts as bearer paper. Once the special indorsement is made, City Water must endorse the check again to transfer it to another party."

The indorser becomes conditionally liable to pay if the paper is dishonored and also retains warranty liability towards subsequent holders. In contrast, a special indorsement, also known as an 'indorsement in full,' names the transferee-holder. Once specially indorsed, the instrument can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds their own signature. The indorser of a special indorsement faces the same liabilities as a blank indorser, including conditional contract liability for payment if the paper is dishonored and warranty liability towards subsequent holders. The key difference lies in the ability to transfer the instrument without additional endorsements: a blank indorsement allows for immediate transfer, while a special indorsement requires further action by the transferee to complete the transfer."

If, say, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n829 \njanitor had stolen the checks, the result would be different, as the janitor is not entrusted with \nresponsibility regarding the instrument. \n \nNegligence \nNot surprisingly, though, if a person fails to exercise ordinary care and thereby substantially contributes \nto the success of a forgery, that person cannot assert “the alteration or the forgery against a person that, in \ngood faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value.” [5] If the issuer is also negligent, the loss is allocated \nbetween them based on comparative negligence theories.

The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement: \n(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder. \n(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as \nthe indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes \nit for value or for collection.… \n \nThe theory under the rule is that since the indorsement is “effective,” the drawee bank was justified in \ndebiting the company’s account. Therefore, [Wachovia argues] the loss should fall on the company whose \nemployee committed the fraud. \n \n…[However] under revised UCC §§ 3-404 and 3-405, the fictitious payee defense triggers principles of \ncomparative fault, so a depositary bank’s own negligence may be considered by the trier of \nfact.…Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the fictitious payee defense does not help Wachovia in \nthis case. \n \n \n \nIV. Allocation of Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n840 \nAs stated supra, comparative negligence applies in this case because of the revisions in the Code. In \ndetermining the liability of the parties, the Court has considered, inter alia [among other things], the \nfollowing factors: \n \n• \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance \nof checks for deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited \nONLY into a non-personal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n• \nApproximately two hundred (200) checks drawn on Victory’s corporate account were deposited \ninto Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. \n• \nThe first twenty-three (23) fraudulent checks were made payable to entities that were not readily \ndistinguishable as businesses, such as “Sean John.” The check dated December 17, 2001 was the \nfirst fraudulent check made payable to a payee that was clearly a business, specifically “Beverly \nHills Shoes, Inc.” \n• \nIn 2001, Victory had approximately seventeen (17) employees, including Lunny. \n• \nLunny had been a bookkeeper for Victory from approximately 1982 until she resigned in May \n2003. Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n• \nAfter forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either indorsed the check with her name \nfollowed by her account number, or referenced her account number following the forged \nindorsement. \n• \nAbout ten (10) out of approximately three hundred (300) checks each month were forged by \nLunny and deposited into her personal account. \n• \nRosenfeld reviewed his bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n841 \n• \nRosenfeld received copies of Victory’s cancelled checks from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nHowever, the copies of the cancelled checks were not in their normal size; instead, they were \nsmaller, with six checks (front and back side) on each page. \n• \nThe forged indorsements were written out in longhand, i.e., Lunny’s own handwriting, rather \nthan a corporate stamped signature. \n• \nVictory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each month. \n• \nAn outside accounting firm performed quarterly reviews of Victory’s bookkeeping records, and \nthen met with Rosenfeld. This review was not designed to pick up fraud or misappropriation. \n \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Victory and Wachovia are comparatively negligent. \n \nWith regard to Wachovia’s negligence, it is clear that Wachovia was negligent in violating its own rules in \nrepeatedly depositing corporate checks into Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. Standard commercial \nbank procedures dictate that a check made payable to a business be accepted only into a business \nchecking account with the same title as the business.

At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that \nalone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of (i) negotiating \nthe instrument, (ii) restricting payment of the instrument, or (iii) incurring indorser’s liability on \nthe instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying \nwords is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n846 \nsignature, or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a \npurpose other than indorsement. \n \nThis paragraph was placed on the back of the check by the government as the maker or drawer of the \ncheck. Consequently, the bank argues that Gill as sole payee could waive, ignore or strike out the \nlanguage. \n \nAlthough the Louisiana jurisprudence contains no similar case dealing with the Uniform Commercial \nCode, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance…In [Citation, a New Jersey case] (1975), the drawer \nof a check placed instructions on the backs of several checks…that the instruments not be deposited until \na specific future date. However, the payee presented some of the checks prior to the date specified on the \nback. The court found that the drawer did not have the capacity to indorse the instruments; as a result the \ntyped instructions on the backs of the checks could not be indorsements. Instead, they were “merely \nrequests to plaintiff who may or may not comply at its own pleasure. The instructions are neither binding \non plaintiff nor the subsequent holders.” In other words, the payee could ignore the instructions. \n \nIn the instant case, the payee did precisely that. Gill ignored the writing on the back of the check and \ninstructed the teller at the defendant bank to do the same through verbal and written instructions. \n \nWisner argues that by affixing his signature under the writing on the back of the check, Gill made it his \nown indorsement. Furthermore, it asserts that it was a restrictive indorsement, not a conditional one \nwhich could be disregarded pursuant to 3-206. Wisner relies upon the provisions of 3-206 for the \nproposition that the check had a restrictive indorsement and that the bank converted the check because it \nfailed to apply the amount it paid consistently with the indorsement. However, Comment 3 to 3-206 \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \nThis Article does not displace the law of waiver as it may apply to restrictive indorsements. The \ncircumstances under which a restrictive indorsement may be waived by the person who made it \nis not determined by this Article. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n847 \n \nNot all jurisdictions recognize a doctrine of waiver of restrictive indorsements.

Suppose Lorna Love had given Rackets, Inc., a promissory note for \nthe tennis rackets. Knowing that it intended to deliver defective tennis rackets and that Love is likely to \nprotest as soon as the shipment arrives, Rackets offers a deep discount on the note to its fleet mechanic: \ninstead of the $1,000 face value of the note, Rackets will give it to him in payment of an outstanding bill of \n$400. The mechanic, being naive in commercial dealings, has no suspicion from the large discount that \nRackets might be committing fraud. He has acted in good faith under the UCC test. That is not to say that \nno set of circumstances will ever exist to warrant a finding that there was a lack of good faith. \n \n \n \nObservance of Reasonable Commercial Standards of Fair Dealing \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n858 \nWhether reasonable commercial standards were observed in the dealings is objectively tested, but buying \nan instrument at a discount—as was done in the tennis rackets example—is not commercially \nunreasonable, necessarily. \n \nWithout Notice \nIt obviously would be unjust to permit a holder to enforce an instrument that he knew—when he acquired \nit—was defective, was subject to claims or defenses, or had been dishonored. A purchaser with knowledge \ncannot become an HDC. But proving knowledge is difficult, so the UCC at Section 3-302(2) lists several \ntypes of notice that presumptively defeat any entitlement to status as HDC. Notice is not limited to receipt \nof an explicit statement; it includes an inference that a person should have made from the circumstances. \nThe explicit things that give a person notice include those that follow. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Is Overdue \nThe UCC provides generally that a person who has notice that an instrument is overdue cannot be an \nHDC. What constitutes notice? When an inspection of the instrument itself would show that it was due \nbefore the purchaser acquired it, notice is presumed. A transferee to whom a promissory note due April \n23 is negotiated on April 24 has notice that it was overdue and consequently is not an HDC. Not all paper \ncontains a due date for the entire amount, and demand paper has no due date at all. In Sections 3-\n302(a)(2) and 3-304, the UCC sets out specific rules dictating what is overdue paper. \n \nWithout Notice That an Instrument Has Been Dishonored \nDishonor means that instrument is not paid when it is presented to the party who should pay it. \n \nWithout Notice of a Defense or Claim \nA purchaser of an instrument cannot be an HDC if he has notice that there are any defenses or claims \nagainst it. A defense is a reason why the would-be obligor will not pay; a claim is an assertion of \nownership in the instrument. If a person is fraudulently induced to issue or make an instrument, he has a \nclaim to its ownership and a defense against paying. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n859 \nWithout Notice of Unauthorized Signature or Alteration \nThis is pretty clear: a person will fail to achieve the HDC status if he has notice of alteration or an \nunauthorized signature. \n \nWithout Reason to Question the Instrument’s Authenticity Because of Apparent Forgery, \nAlteration, or Other Irregularity or Incompleteness as to Call into Question Its Authenticity \nThis also is pretty straightforward, though it is worth observing that a holder will flunk the HDC test if she \nhas notice of unauthorized signature or alteration, or if she should have notice on account of apparent \nirregularity. So a clever forgery would not by itself defeat the HDC status, unless the holder had notice of \nit. \n \nPayee as Holder in Due Course \nThe payee can be an HDC, but in the usual circumstances, a payee would have knowledge of claims or \ndefenses because the payee would be one of the original parties to the instrument. Nevertheless, a payee \nmay be an HDC if all the prerequisites are met. For instance, Blackstone fraudulently convinces \nWhitestone into signing a note as a comaker, with Greenstone as the payee. Without authority, Blackstone \nthen delivers the note for value to Greenstone. Having taken the note in good faith, for value, without \nnotice of any problems, and without cause to question its validity because of apparent irregularities, \nGreenstone is an HDC. In any event, typically the HDC is not the payee of the instrument, but rather, is an \nimmediate or remote transferee of the payee. \n \nThe Shelter Rule \nThere is one last point to mention before we get to the real nub of the holder-in-due-course concept (that \nthe sins of her predecessors are washed away for an HDC). The shelter rule provides that the transferee \nof an instrument acquires the same rights that the transferor had. Thus a person who does not himself \nqualify as an HDC can still acquire that status if some previous holder (someone “upstream”) was an \nHDC. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n860",

This case illustrates that while 'Honesty in fact' is subjectively tested, it does not automatically preclude a finding of lack of good faith under all circumstances.

                    "answer": "According to the UCC, a person cannot be considered a holder in due course (HDC) if they have notice of certain conditions related to the instrument they are acquiring. These conditions include knowing that the instrument is defective, subject to claims or defenses, or has been dishonored. Additionally, a person cannot be an HDC if they know the instrument is overdue, or if they have notice of unauthorized signatures or alterations. Furthermore, if the instrument is overdue, contains a due date that would be evident upon inspection, or is dishonored, notice is presumed. The UCC also states that a person cannot be an HDC if they have knowledge of any defenses or claims against the instrument. These conditions are crucial in determining the authenticity and legitimacy of the transfer of instruments in commerce, ensuring that only those who act in good faith, without notice of defects or irregularities, can become HDCs. The shelter rule, which allows a transferee to acquire the same rights as an upstream holder who was an HDC, further reinforces the importance of these conditions in protecting the integrity of commercial transactions."

Unknown \nto Harold, however, the manuscript is a forgery. Harold signs a promissory note payable to Clifford for \n$250,000 on August 1. Clifford negotiates the note to Betsy on July 1 for $200,000; she is unaware of the \nfraud. On August 2, Betsy gives the note to Al as a token of her affection. Al is Clifford’s friend and knows \nabout the scam (see Figure 21.1 \"The Shelter Rule\"). May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument. A payee may be an HDC but usually would not be (because \nhe would know of problems with it). The shelter rule says that a transferee of an instrument acquires the \nsame rights her transferor had, so a person can have the rights of an HDC without satisfying the requirements \nof an HDC (provided she does not engage in any fraud or illegality related to the transaction). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Summarize the requirements to be a holder in due course. \n2. Why is the status of holder in due course important in commercial transactions? \n3. Why is it unlikely that a payee would be a holder in due course? \n4.

                    "answer": "The shelter rule plays a significant role in determining the rights of a transferee in relation to an instrument held by an immediate or remote transferor who is a holder in due course (HDC). According to this rule, a transferee acquires the same rights as the transferor, regardless of whether the transferee themselves qualifies as an HDC. This means that even if a transferee does not meet the specific criteria for being an HDC, such as taking the instrument for value or in good faith, they can still benefit from the rights of an HDC if their transferor was an HDC. For example, in the scenario where Clifford sells a forged promissory note to Betsy, who then gifts it to Al, despite Al not meeting the criteria for being an HDC, he can still assert the rights of an HDC due to the shelter rule. This rule ensures that the holder in due course can maintain a free market for negotiable instruments, as the rights of the HDC are passed down through subsequent transfers, provided the transferee does not engage in any fraudulent activities related to the transaction."

While not going so far as to say that cashing a postdated check prevents a holder from \nobtaining holder-in-due-course status in every instance, the presentation of a postdated check should put \nthe check cashing entity on notice that the check might not be good.

Triffin] purchased, through assignment agreements with check cashing companies, \neighteen dishonored checks, issued by defendant Hauser Contracting Company (Hauser Co.). Plaintiff \nthen filed suit…to enforce Hauser Co.’s liability on the checks. The trial court granted plaintiff’s motion for \nsummary judgment. Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42.

However, when applying the objective prong of the good faith test, it was found that Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially reasonable manner. Specifically, Buckeye accepted the postdated check without making any attempt to verify its validity. This failure to act was deemed insufficient for obtaining holder-in-due-course status, as the UCC now requires that a holder not only demonstrate honesty in fact but also act in a commercially reasonable manner. Thus, Buckeye's lack of verification constituted a breach of this duty and prevented them from achieving holder-in-due-course status."

                    "answer": "The court's decision in Buckeye v. Camp reflected the change in the UCC Article 3 requirements regarding 'good faith' after 1990 by incorporating an objective component of 'reasonable commercial standards.' Prior to 1990, the pre-1990 UCC Article 3 did not explicitly require a holder to act in a commercially reasonable manner to obtain holder-in-due-course status. However, the post-1990 UCC Article 3 amendments aimed to place a duty on the holders of certain instruments to act responsibly to obtain such status. In this case, the court suggested that Buckeye should have taken minimal steps to verify the validity of the postdated check before accepting it. The court noted that while cashing a postdated check does not automatically prevent a holder from achieving holder-in-due-course status, presenting a postdated check should prompt the check-cashing entity to make some form of verification to protect its interests. This was not done by Buckeye, leading to their inability to meet the new standards for 'good faith' under the amended UCC."

Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with \nthird parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Able signs his name on a note with an entirely illegible squiggle. Is that a valid signature? \n2. Under what circumstances is an agent clearly not personally liable on an instrument? \n3.

Background \nMartin, an attorney, received an e-mail message on August 16, 2008, from a person who called himself \nRoman Hidotashi. Hidotashi claimed that he was a representative of Chipang Lee Song Manufacturing \nCompany and needed to hire a lawyer to collect millions of dollars from past-due accounts of North \nAmerican customers. Martin agreed to represent the company. \n \nOn September 8, 2008, Martin received a check for $290,986.15 from a purported Chipang Lee Song \nManufacturing Company customer, even though Martin had yet to commence any collections work. The \ncheck, which was drawn on First Century Bank USA, arrived in an envelope with a Canadian postmark \nand no return address. The check was accompanied by an undated transmittal letter. Martin endorsed the \ncheck and deposited it in his client trust account at PNC. Martin then e-mailed Hidotashi, reported that \nhe had deposited the check, and stated that he would await further instructions. \n \nHidotashi responded to Martin’s e-mail message on September 9, 2008.

The majority interpreted this to mean that the bank could reasonably request additional forms of identification beyond a driver's license and credit card, such as a thumbprint, especially in the context of a new program aimed at preventing fraud. The dissenting judges, however, believed that the bank's request went beyond what was reasonable under the circumstances, arguing that the bank should have accepted the driver's license and credit card as sufficient identification without requesting a thumbprint.

PNC moves for summary judgment on both counts. \n \nII. Discussion \nA. Breach of transfer warranties \nPNC is entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-transfer-warranties claim because the undisputed \nfacts establish Martin’s liability. \nTransfer warranties trigger when a person transfers an instrument for consideration. UCC § 3-416(a)). A \ntransfer, for purposes of the statute, occurs when an instrument is delivered by a person other than its \nissuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument. § 3-\n203(a). Martin transferred an instrument to PNC when he endorsed the check and deposited it in his \naccount, thereby granting PNC the right to enforce the check. [Citation] Consideration, for purposes of the \nstatute, need only be enough to support a simple contract. [Citation] Martin received consideration from \nPNC because PNC made the funds provisionally available before confirming whether First Century Bank \nwould honor the check. \n \nAs a warrantor, Martin made a number of representations to PNC, including representations that he was \nentitled to enforce the check and that all signatures on the check were authentic and authorized. [UCC] § \n3-416(a). Martin breached his warranties twofold. First, he was not entitled to enforce the check because \nthe check was a counterfeit and, as a result, Martin had nothing to enforce. Second, the drawer’s signature \nwas not authentic because the check was a counterfeit. \n \nMartin does not dispute these facts. Instead, Martin argues, summary judgment is inappropriate because \nFriedman and Jennewein admitted that PNC made a mistake when Friedman said that he thought the \ncheck cleared and Jennewein said that she never would have authorized the wire transfer. Friedman’s and \nJennewein’s statements are immaterial facts. The transfer warranties placed the risk of loss on Martin, \nregardless of whether PNC, Martin, or both of them were at fault. [Citation] Martin, in any event, fails to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n928 \nsupport Friedman’s and Jennewein’s statements with firsthand deposition testimony or affidavits, so the \nstatements do not qualify as competent evidence. [Citation] \n \nMartin claims that the risk of loss falls on the bank. But the cases Martin cites in support of that \nproposition suffer from two defects. First, all but one of the cases were decided before the Kentucky \nGeneral Assembly adopted the Uniform Commercial Code. Martin fails to argue, much less demonstrate, \nthat his cases are good law. Second, Martin’s cases are inapposite even if they are good law. [UCC] § 3-\n416(a) addresses whether a transferor or transferee bears the risk of loss. Martin’s cases address who \nbears the risk of loss as between other players: a drawee bank and a collecting agent [Citation]; a drawer \nand a drawee bank [Citation]; and an execution creditor and drawee bank [Citation—all of these cases are \nfrom 1910–1930]. The one modern case that Martin cites is also inapposite because the case involves a \ndrawer and a drawee bank. [Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card.

Banks’ relationships with their customers for payment or nonpayment of checks; \n2. Electronic funds transfers and how the Electronic Fund Transfer Act affects the bank-consumer \nrelationship; \n3. What a wholesale funds transfer is and the scope of Article 4A; \n4. What letters of credit are and how they are used. \n \n \nTo this point we have examined the general law of commercial paper as found in Article 3 of the \nUCC. Commercial paper—notwithstanding waves of digital innovation—still passes through bank \ncollection processes by the ton every day, and Article 3 applies to this flow. But there is also a \nseparate article in the UCC, Article 4, “Bank Deposits and Collections.” In case of conflict with Article \n3 rules, those of Article 4 govern. \n \nA discussion of government regulation of the financial services industry is beyond the scope of this \nbook. Our focus is narrower: the laws that govern the operations of the banking system with respect \nto its depositors and customers. Although histories of banking dwell on the relationship between \nbanks and the national government, the banking law that governs the daily operation of checking \naccounts is state based—Article 4 of the UCC. The enormous increase in noncheck banking has given \nrise to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, a federal law. \n \n \n \n \n \n23.1 Banks and Their Customers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

No checks change hands; no paper is written on. It is quiet, odorless, smudge proof. But errors \nare harder to trace than when a paper trail exists, and when the system fails (“our computer is down”) the \nfinancial mess can be colossal. Obviously some sort of law is necessary to regulate EFT systems. \n \nElectronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 \nPurpose \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n953 \nBecause EFT is a technology consisting of several discrete types of machines with differing purposes, its \ngrowth has not been guided by any single law or even set of laws. The most important law governing \nconsumer transactions is the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978, [1] whose purpose is “to provide a \nbasic framework establishing the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund \ntransfer systems. The primary objective of [the statute], however, is the provision of individual consumer \nrights.” This federal statute has been implemented and supplemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s \nRegulation E, Comptroller of the Currency guidelines on EFT, and regulations of the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board. (Wholesale transactions are governed by UCC Article 4A, which is discussed later in this \nchapter.) \n \nThe EFT Act of 1978 is primarily designed to disclose the terms and conditions of electronic funds \ntransfers so the customer knows the rights, costs and liabilities associated with EFT, but it does not \nembrace every type of EFT system. Included are “point-of-sale transfers, automated teller machine \ntransactions, direct deposits or withdrawal of funds, and transfers initiated by telephone or computer” \n(EFT Act Section 903(6)). Not included are such transactions as wire transfer services, automatic \ntransfers between a customer’s different accounts at the same financial institution, and “payments made \nby check, draft, or similar paper instrument at electronic terminals” (Reg. E, Section 205.2(g)). \n \nConsumer Protections Afforded by the Act \nFour questions present themselves to the mildly wary consumer facing the advent of EFT systems: (1) \nWhat record will I have of my transaction? (2) How can I correct errors? (3) What recourse do I have if a \nthief steals from my account? (4) Can I be required to use EFT? The EFT Act, as implemented by \nRegulation E, answers these questions as follows. \n \n1. Proof of transaction. The electronic terminal itself must be equipped to provide a receipt of transfer, \nshowing date, amount, account number, and certain other information. Perhaps more importantly, \nthe bank or other financial institution must provide you with a monthly statement listing all \nelectronic transfers to and from the account, including transactions made over the computer or \ntelephone, and must show to whom payment has been made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n954 \n2. Correcting errors. You must call or write the financial institution whenever you believe an error has \nbeen made in your statement. You have sixty days to do so. If you call, the financial institution may \nrequire you to send in written information within ten days. The financial institution has forty-five \ndays to investigate and correct the error. If it takes longer than ten days, however, it must credit you \nwith the amount in dispute so that you can use the funds while it is investigating. The financial \ninstitution must either correct the error promptly or explain why it believes no error was made. You \nare entitled to copies of documents relied on in the investigation.",

Recourse for loss or theft. If you notify the issuer of your EFT card within two business days after \nlearning that your card (or code number) is missing or stolen, your liability is limited to $50. If you \nfail to notify the issuer in this time, your liability can go as high as $500.

Mandatory use of EFT. Your employer or a government agency can compel you to accept a salary \npayment or government benefit by electronic transfer. But no creditor can insist that you repay \noutstanding loans or pay off other extensions of credit electronically. The act prohibits a financial \ninstitution from sending you an EFT card “valid for use” unless you specifically request one or it is \nreplacing or renewing an expired card. The act also requires the financial institution to provide you \nwith specific information concerning your rights and responsibilities (including how to report losses \nand thefts, resolve errors, and stop payment of preauthorized transfers). A financial institution may \nsend you a card that is “not valid for use” and that you alone have the power to validate if you choose \nto do so, after the institution has verified that you are the person for whom the card was intended. \n \n \n \nLiability of the Financial Institution \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n955 \nThe financial institution’s failure to make an electronic fund transfer, in accordance with the terms and \nconditions of an account, in the correct amount or in a timely manner when properly instructed to do so \nby the consumer makes it liable for all damages proximately caused to the consumer, except where \n \n1) the consumer’s account has insufficient funds; \n2) the funds are subject to legal process or other encumbrance restricting such transfer; \n3) such transfer would exceed an established credit limit; \n4) an electronic terminal has insufficient cash to complete the transaction; or \n5) a circumstance beyond its control, where it exercised reasonable care to prevent such an \noccurrence, or exercised such diligence as the circumstances required. \n \nEnforcement of the Act \nA host of federal regulatory agencies oversees enforcement of the act. These include the Comptroller of the \nCurrency (national banks), Federal Reserve District Bank (state member banks), Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation regional director (nonmember insured banks), Federal Home Loan Bank Board \nsupervisory agent (members of the FHLB system and savings institutions insured by the Federal Savings \n& Loan Insurance Corporation), National Credit Union Administration (federal credit unions), Securities \n& Exchange Commission (brokers and dealers), and the Federal Trade Commission (retail and \ndepartment stores) consumer finance companies, all nonbank debit card issuers, and certain other \nfinancial institutions. Additionally, consumers are empowered to sue (individually or as a class) for actual \ndamages caused by any EFT system, plus penalties ranging from $100 to $1,000.

[Citations] \n \nIn this case, the statute providing for damages, [UCC 4-403(c)], provides that a customer’s recoverable \nloss for a bank’s failure to honor a valid stop payment order “may include damages for dishonor of \nsubsequent items * * *.” The statute does not provide for recouping attorney fees and costs. Meade did not \nallege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages. Additionally, although \nMeade argues that the Bank caused him to lose his bargaining power with the Lumber Company, Meade \ndid not present any evidence that he incurred attorney fees or costs by engaging in litigation with the \nLumber Company. \n \nAbsent statutory authority or an allegation of bad faith, attorney fees are improper in a compensatory \ndamage award.…Therefore, the trial court erred in permitting the jury to hear evidence regarding Meade’s \nexpenditures for his attorney fees and costs. Accordingly, we sustain the Bank’s second assignment of \nerror.… \n \n \n \n \nIV. \nIn its third assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred when it overruled the Bank’s \nmotion for a directed verdict. The Bank moved for a directed verdict both at the conclusion of Meade’s \ncase and at the close of evidence. \n \nThe Bank first asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to show that Meade issued a \nstop payment order that provided it with a reasonable opportunity to act as required by [the UCC]. Meade \npresented evidence that he gave the Bank his stop payment order prior to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, and that \nthe Bank paid the check the following day.…We find that this constitutes sufficient evidence that Meade \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n969 \ncommunicated the stop payment order to the Bank in time to allow the Bank a reasonable opportunity to \nact upon it. \n \nThe Bank also asserts that the record does not contain sufficient evidence that Meade incurred some loss \nresulting from its payment of the check. Pursuant to [UCC 4-403(c)] “[t]he burden of establishing the fact \nand amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop payment order or order to \nclose an account is on the customer.” Establishing the fact and amount of loss, “the customer must show \nsome loss other than the mere debiting of the customer’s account.” [Citation] \n \n…Baker testified that he charged Meade between two hundred-eighty and three hundred dollars to \nproperly laminate the runners and support the barn. Based upon these facts, we find that the record \ncontains sufficient evidence that Meade sustained some loss beyond the mere debiting of his account as a \nresult of the Bank paying his check. Accordingly, we overrule the Bank’s third assignment of error. \n \nV. \n…In its final assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motions for \njudgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.… \n[U]nlike our consideration of the Bank’s motions for a directed verdict, in considering the Bank’s motion \nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we also must consider whether the amount of the jury’s award \nis supported by sufficient evidence. The Bank contends the jury’s general verdict, awarding Meade \n$3,800, is not supported by evidence in the record. \n \nA bank customer seeking damages for the improper payment of a check over a valid stop payment order \ncarries the burden of proving “the fact and amount of loss.” [UCC 4-403(C).] To protect banks and \nprevent unjust enrichment to customers, the mere debiting of the customer’s account does not constitute \na loss. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n970 \nIn this case, the Bank’s payment of Meade’s $1,406.79 check to the Lumber Company discharged Meade’s \ndebt to the Lumber Company in the same amount. Therefore, the mere debiting of $1,406.79 from \nMeade’s account does not constitute a loss. \n \nMeade presented evidence that he incurred $300 in repair costs to make the barn satisfactory. Meade also \nnotes that he never got the four by six-inch runners he wanted. However, Meade’s carpenter, Baker, \ntestified that since he properly laminated the two by six-inch runners, they are just as strong or stronger \nthan the four by six-inch runners would have been. \n \nMeade also presented evidence of his costs and fees. However, as we determined in our review of the \nBank’s second assignment of error, only the court may award costs and fees, and therefore this evidence \nwas improperly admitted. Thus, the evidence cannot support the damage award. Meade did not present \nany other evidence of loss incurred by the Bank’s payment of his check.…Therefore, we find that the trial \ncourt erred in declining to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of damages. Upon \nremand, the trial court should grant in part the Bank’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict",

The statute providing for damages (UCC 4-403(c)) does not specifically allow for recouping attorney fees and costs unless there is a statutory authority or an allegation of bad faith. In this case, Meade did not allege that the Bank acted in bad faith or that he is entitled to punitive damages, and he did not present any evidence that he incurred attorney fees or costs by engaging in litigation with the Lumber Company. Therefore, the trial court erred in permitting the jury to hear evidence regarding Meade’s expenditures for his attorney fees and costs, and the appellate court sustained the Bank’s second assignment of error."

According to the court, the customer must show some loss other than the mere debiting of the customer’s account. Baker testified that he charged Meade between two hundred eighty and three hundred dollars to properly laminate the runners and support the barn. Based on these facts, the court found that the record contained sufficient evidence that Meade sustained some loss beyond the mere debiting of his account as a result of the bank paying his check. This evidence included Meade’s repair costs and the testimony from his carpenter that the properly laminated runners were just as strong or stronger than the four by six-inch runners would have been. As such, the court overruled the Bank’s third assignment of error."

Whether Rogers’ Delay in Detecting the Forgeries Barred Suit against Union Planters. \n \nThe relationship between Rogers and Union Planters is governed by Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial \nCode. [UCC] 4-406(a) and (c) provide that a bank customer has a duty to discover and report \n“unauthorized signatures”; i.e., forgeries. [The section] reflects an underlying policy decision that furthers \nthe UCC’s “objective of promoting certainty and predictability in commercial transactions.” The UCC \nfacilitates financial transactions, benefiting both consumers and financial institutions, by allocating \nresponsibility among the parties according to whomever is best able to prevent a loss. Because the \ncustomer is more familiar with his own signature, and should know whether or not he authorized a \nparticular withdrawal or check, he can prevent further unauthorized activity better than a financial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n973 \ninstitution which may process thousands of transactions in a single day.…The customer’s duty to exercise \nthis care is triggered when the bank satisfies its burden to provide sufficient information to the customer. \nAs a result, if the bank provides sufficient information, the customer bears the loss when he fails to detect \nand notify the bank about unauthorized transactions. [Citation] \n \nA. Union Planters’ Duty to Provide Information under 4-406(a). \nThe court admitted into evidence copies of all Union Planters statements sent to Rogers during the \nrelevant time period. Enclosed with the bank statements were either the cancelled checks themselves or \ncopies of the checks relating to the period of time of each statement. The evidence shows that all bank \nstatements and cancelled checks were sent, via United States Mail, postage prepaid, to all customers at \ntheir “designated address” each month. Rogers introduced no evidence to the contrary. We therefore find \nthat the bank fulfilled its duty of making the statements available to Rogers and that the remaining \nprovisions of 4-406 are applicable to the case at bar.… \nIn defense of her failure to inspect the bank statements, Rogers claims that she never received the bank \nstatements and cancelled checks. Even if this allegation is true, [2] it does not excuse Rogers from failing to \nfulfill her duties under 4-406(a) & (c) because the statute clearly states a bank discharges its duty in \nproviding the necessary information to a customer when it “sends…to a customer a statement of account \nshowing payment of items.”…The word “receive” is absent. The customer’s duty to inspect and report does \nnot arise when the statement is received, as Rogers claims; the customer’s duty to inspect and report \narises when the bank sends the statement to the customer’s address. A reasonable person who has not \nreceived a monthly statement from the bank would promptly ask the bank for a copy of the statement. \nHere, Rogers claims that she did not receive numerous statements. We find that she failed to act \nreasonably when she failed to take any action to replace the missing statements. \n \nB. Rogers’ Duty to Report the Forgeries under 4-406(d). \n[Under UCC 4-406] a customer who has not promptly notified a bank of an irregularity may be precluded \nfrom bringing certain claims against the bank: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n974 \n“(d) If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties \nimposed on the customer by subsection (c), the customer is precluded from asserting against the \nbank: \n(1) The customer’s unauthorized signature…on the item,… \n \nAlso, when there is a series of forgeries, 406(d)(2) places additional duties on the customer, [who is \nprecluded from asserting against the bank]: \n \n(2) The customer’s unauthorized signature…by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in \ngood faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the \ncustomer of the unauthorized signature…and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable \nperiod of time, not exceeding thirty (30) days, in which to examine the item or statement of \naccount and notify the bank. \nAlthough there is no mention of a specific date, Rogers testified that she and her son began looking for the \nstatements in late May or early June of 2001, after her husband had died.…When they discovered that \nstatements were missing, they notified Union Planters in June of 2001 to replace the statements. At this \ntime, no mention of possible forgery was made, even though Neal, Jr., thought that “something was \nwrong.” In fact, Neal, Jr., had felt that something was wrong as far back as December of 2000, but failed \nto do anything. Neal, Jr., testified that neither he nor his mother knew that Reese had been forging checks \nuntil September of 2001.

Even if Rogers claimed she never received the bank statements and cancelled checks, the court found that the bank fulfilled its duty by sending the statements via US Mail to her designated address.

Understand how consumers’ credit records are maintained and may be corrected. \n \n \nThe Cost of Credit \nLenders, whether banks or retailers, are not free to charge whatever they wish for credit. Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business.

However, there are numerous exceptions to these laws, such as business loans, mortgage loans, second mortgages, credit card and retail installment debt, consumer leasing, small loans, lease-purchases on personal property, certain mobile home financing, loans from retirement plans, certain stockbroker loans, and deferred payment of purchase prices.

Moreover, certain charges are not considered interest, such as fees to record \ndocuments in a public office and charges for services such as title examinations, deed preparation, credit \nreports, appraisals, and loan processing. But a creditor may not use these devices to cloak what is in fact a \nusurious bargain; it is not the form but the substance of the agreement that controls. \n \nAs suggested, part of the difficulty here is that governments at all levels have for a generation attempted to \npromote consumption to promote production; production is required to maintain politically acceptable \nlevels of employment. If consumers can get what they want on credit, consumerism increases. Also, \ncertainly, tight limits on interest rates cause creditors to deny credit to the less creditworthy, which may \nnot be helpful to the lower classes. That’s the rationale for the usury exceptions related to pawnshop and \npayday loans. \n \n \nDisclosure of Credit Costs \nSetting limits on what credit costs—as usury laws do—is one thing. Disclosing the cost of credit is another. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act \nUntil 1969, lenders were generally free to disclose the cost of money loaned or credit extended in any way \nthey saw fit—and they did. Financing and credit terms varied widely, and it was difficult and sometimes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n989 \nimpossible to understand what the true cost was of a particular loan, much less to comparison shop. After \nyears of failure, consumer interests finally persuaded Congress to pass a national law requiring disclosure \nof credit costs in 1968. Officially called the Consumer Credit Protection Act, Title I of the law is more \npopularly known as the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The act only applies to consumer credit \ntransactions, and it only protects natural-person debtors—it does not protect business organization \ndebtors. \n \nThe act provides what its name implies: lenders must inform borrowers about significant terms of the \ncredit transaction. The TILA does not establish maximum interest rates; these continue to be governed by \nstate law. The two key terms that must be disclosed are the finance charge and the annual percentage rate. \nTo see why, consider two simple loans of $1,000, each carrying interest of 10 percent, one payable at the \nend of twelve months and the other in twelve equal installments. Although the actual charge in each is the \nsame—$100—the interest rate is not. Why? Because with the first loan you will have the use of the full \n$1,000 for the entire year; with the second, for much less than the year because you must begin repaying \npart of the principal within a month. In fact, with the second loan you will have use of only about half the \nmoney for the entire year, and so the actual rate of interest is closer to 15 percent. Things become more \ncomplex when interest is compounded and stated as a monthly figure, when different rates apply to \nvarious portions of the loan, and when processing charges and other fees are stated separately. The act \nregulates open-end credit (revolving credit, like charge cards) and closed-end credit (like a car loan—\nextending for a specific period), and—as amended later—it regulates consumer leases and credit card \ntransactions, too. \nFigure 24.1 Credit Disclosure Form \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n990 \n \n \nBy requiring that the finance charge and the annual percentage rate be disclosed on a uniform basis, the \nTILA makes understanding and comparison of loans much easier. The finance charge is the total of all \nmoney paid for credit; it includes the interest paid over the life of the loan and all processing charges. The \nannual percentage rate is the true rate of interest for money or credit actually available to the borrower. \nThe annual percentage rate must be calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). \nSee Figure 24.1 \"Credit Disclosure Form\" for an example of a disclosure form used by creditors. \n \nConsumer Leasing Act of 1988 \nThe Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) amends the TILA to provide similar full disclosure for consumers who \nlease automobiles or other goods from firms whose business it is to lease such goods, if the goods are",

The finance charge represents the total amount of money paid for credit, including interest and all processing charges. The APR, on the other hand, reflects the true rate of interest for the money or credit actually available to the borrower, calculated using the total finance charge (including all extra fees). This regulation applies to both open-end credit (such as revolving credit like charge cards) and closed-end credit (such as car loans extending for a specific period).

This amends the TILA by \nrequiring credit card issuers to disclose in a uniform manner the annual percentage rate, annual fees, \ngrace period, and other information on credit card applications. \n \nCredit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 \nThe 1989 act did make it possible for consumers to know the costs associated with credit card use, but the \ncard companies’ behavior over 20 years convinced Congress that more regulation was required. In 2009, \nCongress passed and President Obama signed the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act of 2009 (the Credit Card Act). It is a further amendment of the TILA. Some of the salient \nparts of the act are as follows: \n \n• \nRestricts all interest rate increases during the first year, with some exceptions. The purpose is to \nabolish “teaser” rates. \n• \nIncreases notice for rate increase on future purchases to 45 days. \n• \nPreserves the ability to pay off on the old terms, with some exceptions. \n• \nLimits fees and penalty interest and requires statements to clearly state the required due date and \nlate payment penalty. \n• \nRequires fair application of payments. Amounts in excess of the minimum payment must be \napplied to the highest interest rate (with some exceptions). \n• \nProvides sensible due dates and time to pay. \n• \nProtects young consumers. Before issuing a card to a person under the age of twenty-one, the card \nissuer must obtain an application that contains either the signature of a cosigner over the age of \ntwenty-one or information indicating an independent means of repaying any credit extended. \n• \nRestricts card issuers from providing tangible gifts to students on college campuses in exchange \nfor filling out a credit card application. \n• \nRequires colleges to publicly disclose any marketing contracts made with a card issuer. \n• \nRequires enhanced disclosures. \n• \nRequires issuers to disclose the period of time and the total interest it will take to pay off the card \nbalance if only minimum monthly payments are made. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n992 \n• \nEstablishes gift card protections. [1] \n \nThe Federal Reserve Board is to issue implementing rules. \n \nCreditors who violate the TILA are subject to both criminal and civil sanctions. Of these, the most \nimportant are the civil remedies open to consumers. If a creditor fails to disclose the required \ninformation, a customer may sue to recover twice the finance charge, plus court costs and reasonable \nattorneys’ fees, with some limitations. As to the Credit Card Act of 2009, the issuing companies were not \nhappy with the reforms. Before the law went into effect, the companies—as one commentator put it—\nunleashed a “frenzy of retaliation,” [2]by repricing customer accounts, changing fixed rates to variable \nrates, lowering credit limits, and increasing fees. \n \nState Credit Disclosure Laws \nThe federal TILA is not the only statute dealing with credit disclosures. A uniform state act, the Uniform \nConsumer Credit Code, as amended in 1974, is now on the books in twelve US jurisdictions, [3] though its \neffect on the development of modern consumer credit law has been significant beyond the number of \nstates adopting it. It is designed to protect consumers who buy goods and services on credit by \nsimplifying, clarifying, and updating legislation governing consumer credit and usury. \n \nGetting Credit \nDisclosure of credit costs is a good thing. After discovering how much credit will cost, a person might \ndecide to go for it: get a loan or a credit card. The potential creditor, of course, should want to know if the \napplicant is a good risk; that requires a credit check. And somebody who knows another person’s \ncreditworthiness has what is usually considered confidential information, the possession of which is \nsubject to abuse, and thus regulation. \n \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act \nThrough the 1960s, banks and other lending and credit-granting institutions regularly discriminated",

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well.

In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

                    "question": "What are the limitations and restrictions on wage garnishment according to the federal statute, and how do state laws affect this process?",
                    "answer": "According to the federal statute, an employer cannot fire a worker solely because the worker's pay has been garnished for one debt, although multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge. Employers who violate this provision face penalties including a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. However, the law does not permit an employee fired for having one debt garnished to sue the employer for damages. The federal statute also limits prejudgment garnishment, which was once common in many states where a creditor could garnish wages before a court case. In 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this practice was unconstitutional. Furthermore, states can regulate garnishment as long as their regulations do not conflict with federal law. Some states like North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments unless it is the government doing the garnishment."

Under this act, third-party collection agencies are prohibited from contacting debtors outside of reasonable hours and are not allowed to contact debtors at their workplace if the employer forbids it. Debtors can request collectors to stop all contact, and the agency must comply except to confirm the cessation. If a debtor disputes the debt, the collector must cease collection efforts for 30 days until proof of the debt is provided. Additionally, the act bans collectors from filing lawsuits in remote locations to obtain default judgments and requires that any lawsuit be filed in a court where the debtor resides or where the underlying transaction occurred. These measures aim to protect consumers from unfair and abusive debt collection practices."

In the next chapter, we \nlook at mortgages and nonconsensual liens. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1020 \n \nBasics of Secured Transactions \nThe law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can \nbe the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of \nthe security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that \nis, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) \nthe rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key \nterminology, we examine each of these components in turn. \nHere is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, \nsigns a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s \ndefault, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it. Figure 25.1 \n\"The Grasping Hand\" illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but \nthe hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults. \n \nFigure 25.1 The Grasping Hand \n \n \nSource of Law and Definitions \nSource of Law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1021 \nArticle 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property. The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods. Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on \ncredit at your college bookstore. The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1022 \nback a PMSI. In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book.",

                    "answer": "In this scenario, the bankruptcy trustee would likely win the dispute over the computer. According to the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the computer store's interest in the computer must be analyzed under the rules of perfection. The store claimed it had perfected its interest through mere attachment, but mere attachment typically refers to a security interest in personal property that arises automatically upon the creation of the security interest, such as when a buyer purchases an item on credit. However, in this case, since the school contributed one-third of the cost, the computer likely qualifies as a consumer good under UCC Article 9. When dealing with consumer goods, the UCC provides that a security interest in a consumer good is perfected by the filing of a financing statement by the secured party, not merely by the act of attaching the security interest. Therefore, the bankruptcy trustee, as a representative of the estate, would need to file a financing statement to perfect the interest in the computer. Since the store did not file a financing statement, its interest would not be perfected, and the trustee would prevail in the bankruptcy proceedings."

The same is true of the debtor’s incapacity: it is a defense available \nto the principal debtor but not to the surety. \n \nDefenses of the Surety \nGenerally, the surety may exercise defenses on a contract that would have been available to the principal \ndebtor (e.g., creditor’s breach; impossibility or illegality of performance; fraud, duress, or \nmisrepresentation by creditor; statute of limitations; refusal of creditor to accept tender or performance \nfrom either debtor or surety.) Beyond that, the surety has some defenses of its own. Common defenses \nraised by sureties include the following: \n \n• \nRelease of the principal. Whenever a creditor releases the principal, the surety is discharged, \nunless the surety consents to remain liable or the creditor expressly reserves her rights against the \nsurety. The creditor’s release of the surety, though, does not release the principal debtor because \nthe debtor is liable without regard to the surety’s liability. \n• \nModification of the contract. If the creditor alters the instrument sufficiently to discharge the \nprincipal, the surety is discharged as well. Likewise, when the creditor and principal modify their \ncontract, a surety who has not consented to the modification is discharged if the surety’s risk is \nmaterially increased (but not if it is decreased). Modifications include extension of the time of \npayment, release of collateral (this releases the surety to the extent of the impairment), change in \nprincipal debtor’s duties, and assignment or delegation of the debtor’s obligations to a third party. \nThe surety may consent to modifications. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1060 \n• \nCreditor’s failure to perfect. A creditor who fails to file a financing statement or record a \nmortgage risks losing the security for the loan and might also inadvertently release a surety, but \nthe failure of the creditor to resort first to collateral is no defense. \n• \nStatute of frauds. Suretyship contracts are among those required to be evidenced by some writing \nunder the statute of frauds, and failure to do so may discharge the surety from liability. \n• \nCreditor’s failure to inform surety of material facts within creditor’s knowledge affecting \ndebtor’s ability to perform (e.g., that debtor has defaulted several times before). \n• \nGeneral contract defenses. The surety may raise common defenses like incapacity (infancy), lack \nof consideration (unless promissory estoppel can be substituted or unless no separate \nconsideration is necessary because the surety’s and debtor’s obligations arise at the same time), \nand creditor’s fraud or duress on surety. However, fraud by the principal debtor on the surety to \ninduce the suretyship will not release the surety if the creditor extended credit in good faith; if the \ncreditor knows of the fraud perpetrated by the debtor on the surety, the surety may avoid liability. \nSee Figure 25.6 \"Defenses of Principal Debtor and Surety\". \n \nThe following are defenses of principal debtor only: \n \n• \nDeath or incapacity of principal debtor \n• \nBankruptcy of principal debtor \n• \nPrincipal debtor’s setoffs against creditor \n \nThe following are defenses of both principal debtor and surety: \n \n• \nMaterial breach by creditor \n• \nLack of mutual assent, failure of consideration \n• \nCreditor’s fraud, duress, or misrepresentation of debtor \n• \nImpossibility or illegality of performance \n•",

One, enacted in 1974, is the Real \nEstate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), aimed at abuses in the settlement process—the process of \nobtaining the mortgage and purchasing a residence. The act covers all federally related first mortgage \nloans secured by residential properties for one to four families. It requires the lender to disclose \ninformation about settlement costs in advance of the closing day: it prohibits the lender from “springing” \nunexpected or hidden costs onto the borrower. The RESPA is a US Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) consumer protection statute designed to help home buyers be better shoppers in the \nhome-buying process, and it is enforced by HUD. It also outlaws what had been a common practice of \ngiving and accepting kickbacks and referral fees. The act prohibits lenders from requiring mortgagors to \nuse a particular company to obtain insurance, and it limits add-on fees the lender can demand to cover \nfuture insurance and tax charges. \n \nRedlining. Several statutes are directed to the practice of redlining—the refusal of lenders to make loans \non property in low-income neighborhoods or impose stricter mortgage terms when they do make loans \nthere. (The term derives from the supposition that lenders draw red lines on maps around ostensibly \nmarginal neighborhoods.) The most important of these is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of \n1977. [1] The act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated \nfinancial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, \nconsistent with safe and sound operation. To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine \nbanking institutions for CRA compliance and take this information into consideration when approving \napplications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions. The information is compiled under the \nauthority of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions within its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1084 \npurview to report annually by transmitting information from their loan application registers to a federal \nagency. \n \nThe Note and the Mortgage Documents \nThe note and the mortgage documents are the contracts that set up the deal: the mortgagor gets credit, \nand the mortgagee gets the right to repossess the property in case of default. \n \nThe Note \nIf the lender decides to grant a mortgage, the mortgagor signs two critical documents at the closing: the \nnote and the mortgage. We cover notes in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\". It is \nenough here to recall that in a note (really a type of IOU), the mortgagor promises to pay a specified \nprincipal sum, plus interest, by a certain date or dates. The note is the underlying obligation for which the \nmortgage serves as security. Without the note, the mortgagee would have an empty document, since the \nmortgage would secure nothing. Without a mortgage, a note is still quite valid, evidencing the debtor’s \npersonal obligation. \n \nOne particular provision that usually appears in both mortgages and the underlying notes is \nthe acceleration clause. This provides that if a debtor should default on any particular payment, the \nentire principal and interest will become due immediately at the lender’s option. Why an acceleration \nclause? Without it, the lender would be powerless to foreclose the entire mortgage when the mortgagor \ndefaulted but would have to wait until the expiration of the note’s term. Although the acceleration clause \nis routine, it will not be enforced unless the mortgagee acts in an equitable and fair manner. The problem \narises where the mortgagor’s default was the result of some unconscionable conduct of the mortgagee, \nsuch as representing to the mortgagee that she might take a sixty-day “holiday” from having to make \npayments. In Paul H. Cherry v.

A sample mortgage \nform is presented in Figure 26.2 \"Sample Mortgage Form\". \n \nFigure 26.2 Sample Mortgage Form \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAs a mechanism of security, a mortgage is a promise by the debtor (mortgagor) to repay the creditor \n(mortgagee) for the amount borrowed or credit extended, with real estate put up as security. If the mortgagor \ndoesn’t pay as promised, the mortgagee may repossess the real estate. Mortgage law has ancient roots and \nbrings with it various permutations on the theme that even if the mortgagor defaults, she may nevertheless \nhave the right to get the property back or at least be reimbursed for any value above that necessary to pay \nthe debt and the expenses of foreclosure. Mortgage law is regulated by state and federal statute. \n \nEXERCISES \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1086 \n \n1. What role did the right of redemption play in courts of equity changing the substance of a mortgage from \nan actual transfer of title to the mortgagee to a mere lien on the property? \n2. What abuses did the federal RESPA address? \n3. What are the two documents most commonly associated with mortgage transactions? \n \n  \n \n[1] 12 United States Code, Section 2901. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n26.2 Priority, Termination of the Mortgage, and Other Methods \nof Using Real Estate as Security \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand why it is important that the mortgagee (creditor) record her interest in the debtor’s real estate. \n2. Know the basic rule of priority—who gets an interest in the property first in case of default—and the \nexceptions to the rule. \n3. Recognize the three ways mortgages can be terminated: payment, assumption, and foreclosure. \n4. Be familiar with other methods (besides mortgages) by which real property can be used as security for a \ncreditor. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1087 \nPriorities in Real Property Security \nYou may recall from Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" how important it is for a creditor \nto perfect its secured interest in the goods put up as collateral. Absent perfection, the creditor stands a \nchance of losing out to another creditor who took its interest in the goods subsequent to the first creditor. \nThe same problem is presented in real property security: the mortgagee wants to make sure it has first \nclaim on the property in case the mortgagor (debtor) defaults. \n \nThe General Rule of Priorities \nThe general rule of priority is the same for real property security as for personal property security: the \nfirst in time to give notice of the secured interest is first in right. For real property, the notice is \nby recording the mortgage. Recording is the act of giving public notice of changes in interests in real \nestate. Recording was created by statute; it did not exist at common law. The typical recording statute \ncalls for a transfer of title or mortgage to be placed in a particular county office, usually the auditor, \nrecorder, or register of deeds. \nA mortgage is valid between the parties whether or not it is recorded, but a mortgagee might lose to a \nthird party—another mortgagee or a good-faith purchaser of the property—unless the mortgage is \nrecorded. \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are exceptions to the general rule; two are taken up here. \n \nFixture Filing \nThe fixture-filing provision in Article 9 of the UCC is one exception to the general rule. As noted \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\", the UCC gives priority to purchase-money security \ninterests in fixtures if certain requirements are met. \n \nFuture Advances \nA bank might make advances to the debtor after accepting the mortgage. If the future advances are \nobligatory, then the first-in-time rule applies. For example: Bank accepts Debtor’s mortgage (and records \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1088 \nit) and extends a line of credit on which Debtor draws, up to a certain limit. (Or, as in the construction \nindustry, Bank might make periodic advances to the contractors as work progresses, backed by the \nmortgage.) Second Creditor loans Debtor money—secured by the same property—before Debtor began to \ndraw against the first line of credit. Bank has priority: by searching the mortgage records, Second Creditor",

App. 2005) \n \nApplewick, J. \n \nAlpha Imperial LLC challenges the validity of a non-judicial foreclosure sale on multiple grounds. Alpha \nwas the holder of a third deed of trust on the building sold, and contests the location of the sale and the \nadequacy of the sale price. Alpha also claims that the trustee had a duty to re-open the sale, had a duty to \nthe junior lienholder, chilled the bidding, and had a conflict of interest.

In February 2000 Alpha sold the property at 1406 Fourth Avenue in \nSeattle (the Property) to Pioneer Northwest, LLC (Pioneer). Pioneer financed this purchase with two loans \nfrom [defendant Schnitzer Family Investment, LLC, II (SFI)].  \nPioneer also took a third loan from Alpha at the time of the sale for $1.3 million. This loan from Alpha was \njunior to the two [other] loans[.] \n \nPioneer defaulted and filed for bankruptcy in 2002.…In October 2002 defendant Blackstone Corporation, \nan entity created to act as a non-judicial foreclosure trustee, issued a Trustee’s Notice of Sale.

Currin and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1112 \nWitherspoon represented SFI and 4th Avenue LLC. Sheth received a copy of the Notice of Sale through his \nattorney. \n \nOn January 10, 2003, Sheth and his son Abhi arrived at the Third Avenue entrance to the King County \ncourthouse between 9:30 and 9:45 a.m. They waited for about ten minutes. They noticed two signs posted \nabove the Third Avenue entrance. One sign said that construction work was occurring at the courthouse \nand ‘all property auctions by the legal and banking communities will be moved to the 4th Avenue entrance \nof the King County Administration Building.’ The other sign indicated that the Third Avenue entrance \nwould remain open during construction. Sheth and Abhi asked a courthouse employee about the sign, and \nwere told that all sales were conducted at the Administration Building. \n \nSheth and Abhi then walked to the Administration Building, and asked around about the sale of the \nProperty. [He was told Michael Currin, one of the shareholders of Blackstone—the trustee—was holding \nthe sale, and was advised] to call Currin’s office in Spokane. Sheth did so, and was told that the sale was at \nthe Third Avenue entrance. Sheth and Abhi went back to the Third Avenue entrance. \n \nIn the meantime, Currin had arrived at the Third Avenue entrance between 9:35 and 9:40 a.m. The head \nof SFI, Danny Schnitzer (Schnitzer), and his son were also present. Currin was surprised to notice that no \nother foreclosure sales were taking place, but did not ask at the information desk about it. Currin did not \nsee the signs directing auctions to occur at the Administration Building. Currin conducted the auction, \nSchnitzer made the only bid, for $2.1 million, and the sale was complete. At this time, the debt owed on \nthe first two deeds of trust totaled approximately $4.1 million. Currin then left the courthouse, but when \nhe received a call from his assistant telling him about Sheth, he arranged to meet Sheth back at the Third \nAvenue entrance. When they met, Sheth told Currin that the sales were conducted at the Administration \nBuilding. Currin responded that the sale had already been conducted, and he was not required to go to the \nAdministration Building. Currin told Sheth that the notice indicated the sale was to be at the Third \nAvenue entrance, and that the sale had been held at the correct location. Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003.

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases. Chapter 5, “Creditors, the \nDebtor, and the Estate,” deals with the debtor’s “estate”—his or her assets. It lays down ground rules for",

This trend was driven by a combination of economic factors and changes in consumer behavior, leading to higher levels of personal debt. The 2005 law, which was preceded by extensive lobbying efforts primarily by banks and credit card companies, aimed to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. Critics argued that the law was a mechanism for the credit card industry to extract more money from consumers before their debts were forgiven."

Chapter 7 is a liquidation process applicable to individuals and businesses except certain entities like railroads, insurance companies, and banks. Chapter 9 is specifically for municipalities that want to adjust their debts. Chapter 11 allows companies to reorganize while continuing operations, providing a pathway to potentially emerge stronger post-reorganization. Chapter 12 caters to family farmers or fishermen with regular annual income. Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income and debt up to about $1.3 million, allowing them to propose a repayment plan. Lastly, Chapter 15 addresses cross-border insolvency cases, promoting international cooperation in handling such scenarios. Each chapter outlines specific eligibility criteria and procedural requirements tailored to the unique needs of the debtor's situation."

However, some principles \nvary, and we conclude the chapter by noting special features of two other important proceedings—Chapter \n13 and Chapter 11. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBankruptcy law’s purpose is to give the honest debtor a fresh start and to resolve disputes among creditors. \nThe most recent amendments to the law were effective in 2005. Bankruptcy law provides relief to six kinds of \ndebtors: (1) Chapter 7, straight bankruptcy—liquidation—applies to most debtors (except banks and \nrailroads); (2) Chapter 9 applies to municipalities; (3) Chapter 11 is business reorganization; (4) Chapter 12 \napplies to farmers; (5) Chapter 13 is for wage earners; and (6) Chapter 15 applies to cross-border \nbankruptcies. The bankruptcy statutes also have several chapters that cover procedures of bankruptcy \nproceedings. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Why is bankruptcy law required in a modern capitalistic society? \n2. Who does the bankruptcy trustee represent? \n3. The three most commonly filed bankruptcies are Chapter 7, 11, and 13. Who gets relief under those \nchapters? \n \n  \n \n[1] CCH Bankruptcy Reform Act Briefing, “Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005,” \nApril 2005, http://www.cch.com/bankruptcy/bankruptcy_04-21.pdf. \n[2] 11 United States Code, Section 109(b). \n[3] 11 United States Code, Section 109(c). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1128 \n[4] 11 United States Code, Section 109(f). \n[5] 11 United States Code, Section 109(e). \n \n \n \n27.2 Case Administration; Creditors’ Claims; Debtors’ \nExemptions and Dischargeable Debts; Debtor’s Estate \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the basic procedures involved in administering a bankruptcy case. \n2. Recognize the basic elements of creditors’ rights under the bankruptcy code. \n3. Understand the fundamentals of what property is included in the debtor’s estate. \n4. Identify some of the debtor’s exemptions—what property can be kept by the debtor. \n5. Know some of the debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. \n6. Know how an estate is liquidated under Chapter 7. \n \n \nCase Administration (Chapter 3 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nRecall that the purpose of liquidation is to convert the debtor’s assets—except those exempt under the \nlaw—into cash for distribution to the creditors and thereafter to discharge the debtor from further \nliability. With certain exceptions, any person may voluntarily file a petition to liquidate under Chapter 7. A \n“person” is defined as any individual, partnership, or corporation. The exceptions are railroads and \ninsurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and the like. \n \nFor a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding, as for bankruptcy proceedings in general, the various aspects of \ncase administration are covered by the bankruptcy code’s Chapter 3. These include the rules governing \ncommencement of the proceedings, the effect of the petition in bankruptcy, the first meeting of the \ncreditors, and the duties and powers of trustees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1129 \nCommencement \nThe bankruptcy begins with the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with the bankruptcy court. \n \nVoluntary and Involuntary Petitions \nThe individual, partnership, or corporation may file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; 99 percent of \nbankruptcies are voluntary petitions filed by the debtor. But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the",

But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11. To put anyone into bankruptcy involuntarily, the petitioning creditors \nmust meet three conditions: (1) they must have claims for unsecured debt amounting to at least $13,475; \n(2) three creditors must join in the petition whenever twelve or more creditors have claims against the \nparticular debtor—otherwise, one creditor may file an involuntary petition, as long as his claim is for at \nleast $13,475; (3) there must be no bona fide dispute about the debt owing. If there is a dispute, the debtor \ncan resist the involuntary filing, and if she wins the dispute, the creditors who pushed for the involuntary \npetition have to pay the associated costs. Persons owing less than $13,475, farmers, and charitable \norganizations cannot be forced into bankruptcy. \n \nThe Automatic Stay \nThe petition—voluntary or otherwise—operates as a stay against suits or other actions against the debtor \nto recover claims, enforce judgments, or create liens (but not alimony collection). In other words, once the \npetition is filed, the debtor is freed from worry over other proceedings affecting her finances or property. \nNo more debt collection calls! Anyone with a claim, secured or unsecured, must seek relief in the \nbankruptcy court. This provision in the act can have dramatic consequences. Beset by tens of thousands of \nproducts-liability suits for damages caused by asbestos, UNR Industries and Manville Corporation, the \nnation’s largest asbestos producers, filed (separate) voluntary bankruptcy petitions in 1982; those filings \nautomatically stayed all pending lawsuits. \n \nFirst Meeting of Creditors \nOnce a petition in bankruptcy is filed, the court issues an order of relief, which determines that the \ndebtor’s property is subject to bankruptcy court control and creates the stay. The Chapter 7 case may be \ndismissed by the court if, after a notice and hearing, it finds that among other things (e.g., delay, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1130 \nnonpayment of required bankruptcy fees), the debts are primarily consumer debts and the debtor could \npay them off—that’s the 2005 act’s famous “means test,” discussed in Section 27.3 \"Chapter 7 \nLiquidation\". \n \nAssuming that the order of relief has been properly issued, the creditors must meet within a reasonable \ntime. The debtor is obligated to appear at the meeting and submit to examination under oath. The judge \ndoes not preside and, indeed, is not even entitled to attend the meeting. \n \nWhen the judge issues an order for relief, an interim trustee is appointed who is authorized initially to \ntake control of the debtor’s assets. The trustee is required to collect the property, liquidate the debtor’s \nestate, and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. The trustee may sue and be sued in the name of the \nestate. Under every chapter except Chapter 7, the court has sole discretion to name the trustee. Under \nChapter 7, the creditors may select their own trustee as long as they do it at the first meeting of creditors \nand follow the procedures laid down in the act. \nTrustee’s Powers and Duties \nThe act empowers the trustee to use, sell, or lease the debtor’s property in the ordinary course of business \nor, after notice and a hearing, even if not in the ordinary course of business. In all cases, the trustee must \nprotect any security interests in the property. As long as the court has authorized the debtor’s business to \ncontinue, the trustee may also obtain credit in the ordinary course of business. She may invest money in \nthe estate to yield the maximum, but reasonably safe, return. Subject to the court’s approval, she may \nemploy various professionals, such as attorneys, accountants, and appraisers, and may, with some \nexceptions, assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases that the debtor has made. The \ntrustee also has the power to avoid many prebankruptcy transactions in order to recover property of the \ndebtor to be included in the liquidation. \n \nCreditors’ Claims, the Debtor, and the Estate (Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nWe now turn to the major matters covered in Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy act: creditors’ claims, debtors’ \nexemptions and discharge, and the property to be included in the estate.

This means that once the petition is filed, the debtor is freed from financial worries and debt collection calls cease.

Claims made by gap creditors in an involuntary bankruptcy petition under \nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 are those that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy \npetition and the order for relief issued by the court. These claims are given priority because \notherwise creditors would not deal with the debtor, usually a business, when the business has \ndeclared bankruptcy but no trustee has been appointed and no order of relief issued. \n \n(4) Employee wages up to $10,950 for each worker, for the 180 days previous to either the \nbankruptcy filing or when the business ceased operations, whichever is earlier (180-day period). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1133 \n \n(5) Unpaid contributions to employee benefit plans during the 180-day period, but limited by \nwhat was already paid by the employer under subsection (4) above plus what was paid on behalf \nof the employees by the bankruptcy estate for any employment benefit plan. \n(6) Any claims for grain from a grain producer or fish from a fishermanfor up to $5,400 each \nagainst a storage or processing facility. \n \n(7) Consumer layaway deposits of up to $2,425 each. \n \n(8) Taxes owing to federal, state, and local governments for income, property, employment and \nexcise taxes.

The bankruptcy code (perhaps somewhat awkwardly) deals with who gets paid when in \nmore than one place. Chapter 5 sets out priority claims as just noted; that order applies \nto allbankruptcies. Chapter 7, dealing with liquidation (as opposed to Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, wherein \nthe debtor pays most of her debt), then lists the order ofdistribution. Section 726 of 11 United States Code \nprovides: “Distribution of property of the estate.

Following the order \nspecified in the bankruptcy code, our discussion of the order of distribution is taken up in Section 27.3 \n\"Chapter 7 Liquidation\". \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1134 \n \n \n \nDebtor's Duties and Exemptions \nThe act imposes certain duties on the debtor, and it exempts some property that the trustee can \naccumulate and distribute from the estate. \n \nDebtor’s Duties \nThe debtor, reasonably enough, is supposed to file a list of creditors, assets, liabilities, and current \nincome, and a statement of financial affairs. The debtor must cooperate with the trustee and be an “honest \ndebtor” in general; the failure to abide by these duties is grounds for a denial of discharge. \n \nThe individual debtor (not including partnerships or corporations) also must show evidence that he or she \nattended an approved nonprofit budget and counseling agency within 180 days before the filing. The \ncounseling may be “an individual or group briefing (including a briefing conducted by telephone or on the \nInternet) that outline[s] the opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted such individual in \nperforming a related budget analysis.” [1] In Section 111, the 2005 act describes who can perform this \ncounseling, and a host of regulations and enforcement mechanisms are instituted, generally applying to \npersons who provide goods or services related to bankruptcy work for consumer debtors whose \nnonexempt assets are less than $150,000, in order to improve the professionalism of attorneys and others \nwho work with debtors in, or contemplating, bankruptcy. A debtor who is incapacitated, disabled, or on \nactive duty in a military zone doesn’t have to go through the counseling. \n \nDebtor’s Exemptions \nThe bankruptcy act exempts certain property of the estate of an individual debtor so that he or she will not \nbe impoverished upon discharge. Exactly what is exempt depends on state law. \n \nNotwithstanding the Constitution’s mandate that Congress establish “uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies,” bankruptcy law is in fact not uniform because the states persuaded Congress to allow \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1135 \nnonuniform exemptions. The concept makes sense: what is necessary for a debtor in Maine to live a \nnonimpoverished postbankruptcy life might not be the same as what is necessary in southern California. \nThe bankruptcy code describes how a person’s residence is determined for claiming state exemptions:",

Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 11 bankruptcies. \n2. Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 13 bankruptcies. \n \n \nReorganization: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy \nOverview \nChapter 11 provides a means by which corporations, partnerships, and other businesses, including sole \nproprietorships, can rehabilitate themselves and continue to operate free from the burden of debts that \nthey cannot pay. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1149 \n \nIt is simple enough to apply for the protection of the court in Chapter 11 proceeding, and for many years, \nlarge financially ailing companies have sought shelter in Chapter 11. Well-known examples include \nGeneral Motors, Texaco, K-Mart, Delta Airlines, and Northwest Airlines. An increasing number of \ncorporations have turned to Chapter 11 even though, by conventional terms, they were solvent. Doing so \nenables them to negotiate with creditors to reduce debt. It also may even permit courts to snuff out \nlawsuits that have not yet been filed. Chapters 3 and 5, discussed in Section 27.2 \"Case Administration; \nCreditors’ Claims; Debtors’ Exemptions and Dischargeable Debts; Debtor’s Estate\", apply to Chapter 11 \nproceedings also. Our discussion, therefore, is limited to special features of Chapter 11. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nAny person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 proceeding (plus railroads) is eligible for a Chapter 11 \nproceeding, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers. Individuals filing Chapter 11 must take credit \ncounseling; businesses do not. A company may voluntarily enter Chapter 11 or may be put there \ninvoluntarily by creditors. Individuals can file Chapter 11 particularly if they have too much debt to qualify \nfor Chapter 13 and make too much money to qualify for Chapter 7; under the 2005 act, individuals must \ncommit future wages to creditors, just as in Chapter 13. [1] \n \nOperation of Business \nUnless a trustee is appointed, the debtor will retain possession of the business and may continue to \noperate with its own management. The court may appoint a trustee on request of any party in interest \nafter notice and a hearing. The appointment may be made for cause—such as dishonesty, incompetence, \nor gross mismanagement—or if it is otherwise in the best interests of the creditors. Frequently, the same \nincompetent management that got the business into bankruptcy is left running it—that’s a criticism of \nChapter 11. \n \nCreditors’ Committee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1150 \nThe court must appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after issuing the order \nfor relief. The committee must consist of creditors willing to serve who have the seven largest claims, \nunless the court decides to continue a committee formed before the filing, if the committee was fairly \nchosen and adequately represents the various claims. The committee has several duties, including these: \n(1) to investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, (2) to determine whether to seek appointment of a trustee \nor to let the business continue to operate, and (3) to consult with the debtor or trustee throughout the \ncase. \n \nThe Reorganization Plan \nThe debtor may always file its own plan, whether in a voluntary or involuntary case. If the court leaves the \ndebtor in possession without appointing a trustee, the debtor has the exclusive right to file a \nreorganization plan during the first 120 days. If it does file, it will then have another 60 days to obtain the \ncreditors’ acceptances. Although its exclusivity expires at the end of 180 days, the court may lengthen or \nshorten the period for good cause. At the end of the exclusive period, the creditors’ committee, a single \ncreditor, or a holder of equity in the debtor’s property may file a plan. If the court does appoint a trustee, \nany party in interest may file a plan at any time. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act specifies certain features of the plan and permits others to be included. \nAmong other things, the plan must (1) designate classes of claims and ownership interests; (2) specify \nwhich classes or interests are impaired—a claim or ownership interest is impaired if the creditor’s legal, \nequitable, contractual rights are altered under the plan; (3) specify the treatment of any class of claims or \ninterests that is impaired under the plan; (4) provide the same treatment of each claim or interests of a",

Basically, what the plan does is provide a process \nfor rehabilitating the company’s faltering business by relieving it from repaying part of its debt and \ninitiating reforms so that the company can try to get back on its feet. \n \nAcceptance of the Plan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1151 \nThe act requires the plan to be accepted by certain proportions of each impaired class of claims and \ninterests. A class of claims accepts the plan if creditors representing at least two-thirds of the dollar \namount of claims and more than one-half the number of allowed claims vote in favor. A class of property \ninterests accepts the plan if creditors representing two-thirds of the dollar amount of the allowed \nownership interests vote in favor. Unimpaired classes of claims and interest are deemed to have accepted \nthe plan; it is unnecessary to solicit their acceptance. \n \nConfirmation of the Plan \nThe final act necessary under Chapter 11 is confirmation by the court. Once the court confirms the plan, \nthe plan is binding on all creditors. The rules governing confirmation are complex, but in essence, they \ninclude the following requirements: \n1. The plan must have been proposed in good faith. Companies must also make a good-faith attempt to \nnegotiate modifications in their collective bargaining agreements (labor union contracts). \n2. All provisions of the act must have been complied with. \n3. The court must have determined that the reorganized business will be likely to succeed and be \nunlikely to require further financial reorganization in the foreseeable future. \n4. Impaired classes of claims and interests must have accepted the plan, unless the plan treats them in a \n“fair and equitable” manner, in which case consent is not required. This is sometimes referred to as \nthe cram-down provision. \n5. All members of every class must have received no less value than they would have in Chapter 7 \nliquidation. \n \nDischarge, Conversion \nThe debtor gets discharged when all payments under the plan are completed. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy \nmay be converted to Chapter 7, with some restrictions, if it turns out the debtor cannot make the plan \nwork. \n \nAdjustment of Debts of an Individual with Regular Income: Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1152 \nIn General \nAnyone with a steady income who is having difficulty paying off accumulated debts may seek the \nprotection of a bankruptcy court in Chapter 13 proceeding (often called the wage earner’s plan). Under \nthis chapter, the individual debtor presents a payment plan to creditors, and the court appoints a trustee. \nIf the creditors wind up with more under the plan presented than they would receive in Chapter 7 \nproceeding, then the court is likely to approve it. In general, a Chapter 13 repayment plan extends the \ntime to pay the debt and may reduce it so that the debtor need not pay it all. Typically, the debtor will pay \na fixed sum monthly to the trustee, who will distribute it to the creditors. The previously discussed \nprovisions of Chapters 3 and 5 apply also to this chapter; therefore, the discussion that follows focuses on \nsome unique features of Chapter 13. \nPeople seek Chapter 13 discharges instead of Chapter 7 for various reasons: they make too much money to \npass the Chapter 7 means test; they are behind on their mortgage or car payments and want to make them \nup over time and reinstate the original agreement; they have debts that can’t be discharged in Chapter 7; \nthey have nonexempt property they want to keep; they have codebtors on a personal debt who would be \nliable if the debtor went Chapter 7; they have a real desire to pay their debts but cannot do so without \ngetting the creditors to give them some breathing room. Chapter 7 cases may always be converted to \nChapter 13. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nChapter 13 is voluntary only. Anyone—sole proprietorships included—who has a regular income, \nunsecured debts of less than $336,000, and secured debts of less than $1,010,650 is eligible to seek its \nprotection. The debts must be unpaid and owing at the time the debtor applies for relief. If the person has",

Thirdly, the court must determine that the reorganized business is likely to succeed and unlikely to require further financial reorganization in the foreseeable future.

The essential difference between assignment and composition lies in the \ncreditors’ agreement: an assignment implies no agreement among the creditors, whereas a composition \ndoes. Not all creditors of the particular debtor need agree to the composition for it to be valid. A creditor \nwho does not agree to the composition remains free to attempt to collect the full sum owed; in particular, \na creditor not inclined to compose the debt could attach the debtor’s assets while other creditors are \nbargaining over the details of the composition agreement. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1157 \nOne advantage of the assignment over the composition is that in the former the debtor’s assets—having \nbeen assigned—are protected from attachment by hungry creditors. Also, the assignment does not require \ncreditors’ consent. However, an advantage to the debtor of the assignment (compared with the \ncomposition) is that in the composition creditors cannot go after the debtor for any deficiency (because \nthey agreed not to). \n \nReceivership \nA creditor may petition the court to appoint a receiver; receivership is a long-established procedure in \nequity whereby the receiver takes over the debtor’s property under instructions from the court. The \nreceiver may liquidate the property, continue to operate the business, or preserve the assets without \noperating the business until the court finally determines how to dispose of the debtor’s property. \n \nThe difficulty with most of the alternatives to bankruptcy lies in their voluntary character: a creditor who \nrefuses to go along with an agreement to discharge the debtor can usually manage to thwart the debtor \nand her fellow creditors because, at the end of the day, the US Constitution forbids the states from \nimpairing private citizens’ contractual obligations. The only final protection, therefore, is to be found in \nthe federal bankruptcy law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBankruptcy is expensive and frequently convoluted. Nonbankruptcy alternatives include assignment for the \nbenefit of creditors (the debtor’s assets are assigned to a trustee who manages or disposes of them for \ncreditors), compositions (agreements by creditors to accept less than they are owed and to discharge the \ndebtor from further liability), and receivership (a type of court-supervised assignment). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The loans have been assigned to Educational \nCredit Management Corporation (“ECMC”). By September 2009, the accrual of interest on these student \nloans had caused the debt to balloon to more than $146,000. The debtor asks the court to declare that \nthese student loans were discharged in bankruptcy. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code provides financially distressed debtors with a fresh start by discharging most of \ntheir pre-petition debts.…However, under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8), there is a presumption that educational \nloans extended by or with the aid of a governmental unit or nonprofit institution are nondischargeable \nunless the debtor can demonstrate that their repayment would be an undue hardship. See [Citation]. This \nexception to a bankruptcy discharge ensures that student loans, which are typically extended solely on the \nbasis of the student’s future earnings potential, cannot be discharged by recent graduates who then pocket \nall of the future benefits derived from their education. See [Citation]. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1159 \nThe debtor bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to a \ndischarge of the student loan. See [Citation]. That is, the debtor must prove that repayment of student \nloans will cause an undue hardship. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code does not define “the undue hardship.” Courts interpreting section 523(a)(8), \nhowever, have concluded that undue hardship [and] is something more than “garden-variety hardship.” \n[Citation.] Only cases involving “real and substantial” hardship merit discharges. See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of",

What is the difference between “criminal restitution” (which in 1994 Congress said could not get \ndischarged at all) and “the costs of prosecution”? \n3. Why did the court decide that Ryan’s obligation to pay “costs of prosecution” was not precluded by the \nlimits on Chapter 13 bankruptcies imposed by Congress? \n \n \n \n27.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThe Constitution gives Congress the power to legislate on bankruptcy. The current law is the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which provides for six types of proceedings: (1) \nliquidation, Chapter 7; (2) adjustment of debts of a municipality, Chapter 9; (3) reorganization, Chapter \n11; (4) family farmers with regular income, Chapter 12; (5) individuals with regular income, Chapter 13; \nand (6) cross-border bankruptcies, Chapter 15. \n \nWith some exceptions, any individual, partnership, or corporation seeking liquidation may file a voluntary \npetition in bankruptcy. An involuntary petition is also possible; creditors petitioning for that must meet \ncertain criteria. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1171 \nA petition operates as a stay against the debtor for lawsuits to recover claims or enforce judgments or \nliens. A judge will issue an order of relief and appoint a trustee, who takes over the debtor’s property and \npreserves security interests. To recover monies owed, creditors must file proof of claims. The trustee has \ncertain powers to recover property for the estate that the debtor transferred before bankruptcy. These \ninclude the power to act as a hypothetical lien creditor, to avoid fraudulent transfers and voidable \npreferences. \n \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priority among them. After secured \nparties take their security, the priorities are (1) domestic support obligations, (2) administrative expenses, \n(3) gap creditor claims, (4) employees’ wages, salaries, commissions, (5) contributions to employee \nbenefit plans, (6) grain or fish producers’ claims against a storage facility, (7) consumer deposits, (8) taxes \nowed to governments, (9) allowed claims for personal injury or death resulting from debtor’s driving or \noperating a vessel while intoxicated. After these priority claims are paid, the trustee must distribute the \nestate in this order: (a) unsecured creditors who filed timely, (b) unsecured creditors who filed late, (c) \npersons claiming fines and the like, (d) all other creditors, (e) the debtor. Most bankruptcies are no-asset, \nso creditors get nothing. \n \nUnder Chapter 7’s 2005 amendments, debtors must pass a means test to be eligible for relief; if they make \ntoo much money, they must file Chapter 13. \n \nCertain property is exempt from the estate of an individual debtor. States may opt out of the federal list of \nexemptions and substitute their own; most have. \n \nOnce discharged, the debtor is no longer legally liable for most debts. However, some debts are not",

                    "answer": "Under Chapter 13, certain exceptions to discharge are more limited compared to Chapter 7. Specifically, Chapter 13 allows for the discharge of 'restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime,' but it does not cover 'costs of prosecution' included in such a sentence. This distinction is rooted in the legislative intent to provide broader discharge options under Chapter 13 to incentivize debtors to choose this chapter over Chapter 7. Ryan's case illustrates this distinction, as he paid a criminal fine and restitution, both of which were discharged, but the costs of prosecution were not, as they fall outside the defined scope of dischargeable items under Chapter 13. This case highlights the narrow construction of the discharge exception in Chapter 13, particularly in chapter 13, as opposed to the broader interpretation under Chapter 7."

This act aimed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy system by limiting the discharge of debts that might otherwise be considered dischargeable under Chapter 13. An example provided in the text is Ryan's case, where he paid a criminal fine and restitution, both of which were discharged, but the costs of prosecution were not. The court determined that the exception to discharge for 'restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime' does not cover 'costs of prosecution.'

Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\nprosper.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\n10\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nThe Great Recession\nThe Great Recession of 2007–2009 exposed many of the weaknesses of our financial system. The ease with\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers. In the end,\nhowever, the program was justified because the economy immediately began a slow but steady recovery,\nmost financial institutions did not fail, and the Treasury recouped all of its investment used in the bailout.\nHowever, individual homeowners suffered greatly.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2008 attempted to address many of the underlying causes of the Great Recession by\nreorganizing and toughening the regulatory framework, including tighter oversight of critically important\nfinancial institutions. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

                    "answer": "Over the past four decades, significant changes reshaped the financial industry structure. Commercial and investment banks underwent mergers, leading to a narrowing or elimination of the separation between their operations. This consolidation resulted in a more integrated financial landscape where these entities could engage in both commercial and investment banking activities without strict regulatory barriers. Additionally, international competition intensified, prompting domestic financial institutions to adapt, innovate, and evolve to remain competitive in a global market. These transformations reflect a shift from highly regulated environments to more market-driven and flexible regulatory frameworks."

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities. The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts",

                    "question": "What are some examples of risk-return trade-offs in our daily lives and how does the study of finance help in making these decisions easier?",
                    "answer": "Daily life is filled with situations where individuals need to weigh the potential benefits against the associated risks. For example, deciding whether to walk across a busy street or wait for the crosswalk involves balancing convenience (potential risk) with safety. Similarly, choosing between buying a used car immediately or having it inspected by a professional before purchasing is another scenario where one must evaluate the cost of potential risks versus the benefits of certainty. Another common situation is accepting an initial job offer post-graduation or waiting for a more desirable position, which requires assessing the immediate financial gain against the long-term career prospects. The study of finance equips people with tools to understand and quantify these trade-offs, enabling them to make more informed decisions. By providing statistical analysis and risk management techniques, finance helps in determining the expected returns and associated risks, thereby making choices more rational and less dependent on intuition alone."

                    "question": "What are the main types of risk in financial markets and how do they impact investments?",
                    "answer": "Financial markets encompass various types of risks, including default risk, inflation risk, diversifiable risk, non-diversifiable risk, and political risk. Default risk pertains to the likelihood that an issuer will fail to meet their financial obligations, such as mortgage payments or bond interest payments. Inflation risk refers to the reduction in purchasing power due to rising prices, which can erode the value of cash flows from investments. Diversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, is specific to individual securities or small portfolios and can often be mitigated through a well-diversified investment strategy. Non-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification and is typically measured using beta, a statistical term that reflects the sensitivity of an investment's returns to market movements. Lastly, political risk encompasses macroeconomic factors beyond a company's control, such as changes in regulations, taxation, or nationalization, which can disrupt cash flows. Each type of risk impacts investments differently, influencing the expected return and overall profitability of an investment, and understanding these risks is crucial for effective financial planning and decision-making."

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur.

However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\nBrokers\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\nFinancial Intermediaries\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\n22\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncreate a completely different security all together. For example, if the borrower defaults on a mortgage loan\ncreated by the commercial bank where you have your certificate of deposit, your investment is still safely\nearning interest, and you are not directly affected.\nFinancial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers\nare able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. When this occurs on a large scale,\nthe process, known as disintermediation, can cause much turmoil in the financial markets. In the 1970s,\ninflation rose above 10% on an annual basis, and yet commercial banks were limited to offering maximum\nrates of 5% on their savings deposits.7 Savers bypassed banks and savings and loan associations to invest\ndirectly into Treasury securities and other short-term marketable securities. This lack of deposit funds and the\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\n1.6",

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\n7\nUnited States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\n23\nHowever, financial forecasting must incorporate macroeconomic assumptions and expectations into individual\nfirm and industry forecasts. Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations.

On the other hand, macroeconomics examines the decisions of groups and studies broader economic issues such as inflation, income, economic growth, and unemployment. Macro factors like these influence financial forecasting, as they impact elements such as the cost of labor, material prices, and borrowing costs. Both areas are crucial for financial forecasting and planning, with microeconomics providing insights into individual behaviors and macroeconomics offering a broader context for understanding economic trends and conditions."

The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

                    "answer": "S corporations are preferred by small businesses over C corporations primarily because they offer significant tax savings. Unlike C corporations, S corporations are taxed as if they were proprietorships or partnerships, meaning that the corporation's earnings are not subject to corporate income tax. Instead, the earnings are distributed to shareholders and taxed as personal income. This avoids the issue of double taxation, which occurs when a corporation's earnings are taxed first as corporate income and then again when distributed to shareholders as dividends. Consequently, S corporations can save their owners a considerable amount of money in taxes, making them a more attractive option for relatively small, privately owned firms."

                    "answer": "LLCs and LLPs offer limited liability protection to their principals, similar to corporations, shielding them from personal liability for business debts and obligations. However, they are taxed as partnerships, which means that the earnings are included in the personal taxes of the members, avoiding the double taxation faced by C corporations. In terms of management control, unlike in a typical corporation where stockholders may have varying degrees of control depending on their shareholding, LLCs and LLPs provide more flexibility. Investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct proportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment. This structure contrasts with the rigid hierarchical structure of a corporation, where the board of directors and management have significant control. Additionally, in an LLC or LLP, only designated partners can have unlimited liability for company debts, while other partners can be designated as limited partners, who are only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution. This feature distinguishes limited liability partnerships from limited partnerships, where a senior general partner has overall control of the business. Overall, LLCs and LLPs offer a more flexible and personalized approach to business organization, particularly beneficial for professional service firms and other smaller enterprises, compared to the more rigid structure of a C corporation."

This follows from the\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\nfavorable growth opportunities.\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid. This, too, is an advantage of a\ncorporation and is another factor that enhances its value.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAmazon\nMost people are surprised to learn than Amazon, the largest online retailer, is set up as an LLC.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n43\nAmazon.com Services LLC is set up as a subsidiary of the larger Amazon.com Inc. Take a look at the Amazon\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\nIncorporating a Business\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\narticles of incorporation include the following:\n•\nDomestic corporation (in state)\n•\nForeign corporation (out of state or out of country)\n•\nClose (closely held) corporation\n•\nProfessional corporation\n•\nNonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\n•\nStock corporation\n•\nNon-stock corporation\n•\nPublic benefit corporation\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\n2.2\nRelationship between Shareholders and Company Management\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between principals and agents.\n•\nList and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\n•\nExplain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\nStakeholders\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.",

Limited ownership liability means that investors' personal assets are protected in case the corporation faces financial difficulties, reducing the overall risks they bear.

LLCs provide the limited liability protection of corporations but with a more flexible management structure and potentially simpler tax treatment. Unlike corporations, LLCs typically avoid double taxation, meaning profits and losses pass directly to the members' personal tax returns without being taxed at the entity level. This can be particularly beneficial for large corporations seeking to optimize tax efficiency while maintaining flexibility in their operational structure. Moreover, LLCs often have fewer regulatory requirements compared to corporations, making them a more straightforward option for managing complex business entities like Amazon."

Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes.

Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm.

Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States.

In our current example, Chris’s landscaping business, the “revenue,” or the value of services\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n107\nperformed, for the month of August would be $1,400. It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services\nprovided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCoffee Shop Products\nThink about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as\nrevenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and\nrelated items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\nSolution:\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,\nwith the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded\nuntil May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded\nin the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be\nrecorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its\ncustomer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual\naccounting (see Figure 4.6).\nFigure 4.6 Credit versus Cash On the left is a credit sale recorded under the cash basis of accounting. On the right, the same credit\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\n108\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAssume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor).

                    "answer": "The revenue recognition principle in accounting refers to recording sales or fees earned within the period they are earned. This means that when a business provides goods or services to customers, whether for cash or on credit, the revenue is recognized in the financial statements during the period the services were performed or the goods were delivered, not necessarily when the payment is received. For instance, in Chris's landscaping business, if she provides $500 worth of services on April 1 but the customer pays later, under the accrual basis of accounting, the revenue would be recorded immediately upon providing the services, reflecting the actual economic activity rather than waiting for payment."

                    "question": "Can you explain the difference between cash basis and accrual basis accounting with respect to recognizing revenue and expenses?",
                    "answer": "Certainly. The main difference between cash basis and accrual basis accounting lies in when revenue and expenses are recorded. Under the cash basis of accounting, transactions are recorded only when cash changes hands. Therefore, a sale is recorded when payment is received, and an expense is recorded when cash is paid out. For example, in Chris’s landscaping business, if she receives a $500 payment for services provided on April 1, it would be recorded as revenue on April 1 under the cash basis. Conversely, under the accrual basis of accounting, revenue and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands. So, if Chris provided the $500 worth of services on April 1, the revenue would be recorded on that date even though the payment might not be received until later. Similarly, an expense is recorded when a business incurs a cost, not necessarily when it pays for it. This approach provides a more accurate picture of a company’s financial performance over time, as it matches revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues."

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows.

Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\nManaging Cash Flow\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item. Doing so helps reveal relationships\nbetween items, aids in assessing performance over time, and makes it easier to compare one company to\nanother, regardless of size (thus the name common-size).\n5.7\nCommon-Size Statements\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nPrepare common-size statements.\n•\nAssess organizational performance using common-size statements.\n•\nUse industry comparisons to assess organizational performance.\nCommon-Size Income Statements\nA common-size income statement is created by restating each line as a percentage of net sales. Expressing\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes. The formula to calculate\neach item on the income statement is:\nUsing Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ current year income statement, we can see how each line item in it is divided\nby net sales in order to assemble a common-size income statement (see Figure 5.20).\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements\n149\nFigure 5.20 Common-Size Income Statement\nIt may seem cumbersome to create a common-size statement. However, a simple tool like Microsoft Excel can\nbe quite handy in making the process easier and faster.

This 50-day difference means the firm will need to cover the costs of providing goods or services for a longer period without immediate cash inflow. On the vendor side, accepting net 10 terms means the firm must pay its suppliers quickly, while requesting net 30 or net 60 terms allows the firm to delay payment, thereby maintaining cash on hand for longer periods. These terms are crucial for managing cash flow, as they determine the timing and volume of cash inflows and outflows, impacting the firm's operational liquidity and financial stability."

This\nconcept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a\ndollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now\ncan be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any\npromise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for\npeople to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make\nthem at some future time.\nFor this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering\nthem greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to\nus, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our\npossession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other\npoint in the future.\nThe entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors\nto make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand\nwhich option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.\nTVM can also be used to help a person understand how much money they’ll need to save in an interest-\nbearing account in order to reach a desired financial goal, such as saving $50,000 in 10 years in an account that\nearns 4% compound interest each year. TVM is the key underlying principle of such important financial\nanalytical activities as retirement planning, corporate capital project evaluation, and even deciding on your\nTime Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\n7\n7 • Why It Matters\n191\nown personal investments and bank accounts.\nIf the main concept behind the TVM is that a specific amount of money in hand now is worth more today than\nthat same amount of money will be worth tomorrow, you might think that a person would be better off\nspending their money now rather than saving it for later use. However, we know that this is not always the\ncase. Sometimes it is simply a better idea to save your money. While inflation can have the effect of making a\ndollar worth less tomorrow than it is worth today, the positive effect of compound interest works in favor of\nsavers and investors.\n7.1\nNow versus Later Concepts\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain why time has an impact on the value of money.\n•\nExplain the concepts of future value and present value.\n•\nExplain why lump sum cash flow is the basis for all other cash flows.\nHow and Why the Passage of Time Affects the Value of Money\nThe concept of the time value of money (TVM) is predicated on the fact that it is possible to earn interest\nincome on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or interest-bearing account. As times goes by,\ninterest is earned on amounts you have invested (present value), which effectively means that time will add\nvalue (future value) to your savings.

The most worrisome limitation could be the reliance on only one data source, as it may not provide a comprehensive view of a company's financial health. To address this, one might consider using multiple sources of data, including qualitative factors, industry trends, and management insights. Another limitation is the use of past data, which may not accurately reflect current or future conditions. To mitigate this, one could incorporate forward-looking financial projections and consider economic forecasts. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the data across different periods and companies can improve the reliability and comparability of ratios."

The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\nas a percentage. So, as a result, we have\nThis formula can be extremely practical when working with financial estimates or projections and for\nunderstanding how compound interest can have a dramatic effect on an original amount or monetary\nbalance.\nFollowing are just a few examples of how the rule of 72 can help you solve problems very quickly and very\neasily, often enabling you to solve them “in your head,” without the need for a calculator or spreadsheet.\nLet’s say you are interested in knowing how long it will take your savings account balance to double. If your\naccount earns an interest rate of 9%, your money will take\nor 8, years to double. However, if you are\nearning only 6% on this same investment, your money will take\n, or 12, years to double.\nNow let’s say you have a specific future purchasing need and you know that you will need to double your\nmoney in five years. In this case, you would be required to invest it at an interest rate of\n, or 14.4%.\nThrough these sample examples, it is easy to see how relatively small changes in a growth or interest rate can\nhave significant impact on the time required for a balance to double in size.\nTo further illustrate some uses of the rule of 72, let’s say we have a scenario in which we know that a country’s\ngross domestic product is growing at 4% a year. By using the rule of 72 formula, we can determine that it will\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance\n219\ntake the economy 72/4, or 18, years to effectively double.\nNow, if the economic growth slips to 2%, the economy will double in\n, or 36, years. However, if the rate of\ngrowth increases to 11%, the economy will effectively double in\n, or 6.55, years. By performing such\ncalculations, it becomes obvious that reducing the time it takes to grow an economy, or increasing its rate of\ngrowth, could end up being very important to a population, given its current level of technological innovation\nand development.\nIt is also very easy to use the rule of 72 to express future costs being impacted by inflation or future savings\namounts that are earning interest.\nTo apply another example, if the inflation rate in an economy were to increase from 2% to 3%, consumers\nwould lose half of the purchasing power of their money. This is calculated as the value of their money doubling\nin\n, or 24, years as compared to\n, or 36, years—quite a substantial difference.\nNow, let’s say that tuition costs at a certain college are increasing at a rate of 7% per year, which happens to\nbe greater than current inflation rates. In this case, tuition costs would end up doubling in\n, or about 10.3,\nyears.\nIn an example related to personal finance, we can say that if you happen to have an annual percentage rate of\n24% interest on your credit card and you do not make any payments to reduce your balance, the total amount\nyou owe to the credit card company will double in only\n, or 3, years.\nSo, as we have seen, the rule of 72 can clearly demonstrate how a relatively small difference of 1 percentage\npoint in GDP growth or inflation rates can have significant effects on any short- or long-term economic\nforecasting models.\nIt is important to understand that the rule of 72 can be applied in any scenario where we have a quantity or an\namount that is in the process of growing or is expected to grow for any period of time into the future. A good\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in\nor\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only\n, or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\nInvesting and Risk\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.",

For example, if a country's gross domestic product (GDP) is growing at 4% a year, it will take 18 years for the economy to effectively double. Conversely, if the economic growth rate drops to 2%, it will take 36 years for the economy to double, highlighting the significant impact of even small changes in the growth rate. Similarly, the rule of 72 can be used to project population growth. An increase in a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% means that overall economic capacity would need to be expanded in 24 years instead of 36 years. This demonstrates how a 1% increase in population growth can dramatically reduce the time needed for growth or infrastructure expansion."

The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries. Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for\n$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore\ntaxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission\nis offering you instead.\nBy substitution, and following the proper order of operations:\nAll things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119\ntoday. Now you can compare like numbers, and the $787,000 cash lump sum is worth more than the\ndiscounted future payments. That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.",

This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate. Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy. Common benchmark rates include the US Treasury note rate, the Federal Reserve funds rate\n(federal funds rate), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the prime rate.\nSo, investors who decide to purchase normal (fixed rate) bonds may not be thrilled to hear that the economy is\nsignaling inflation and that interest rates are forecasted to rise. These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate\nbonds.\nBonds with very low coupon rates are referred to as deep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the\ngreatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero. The smaller the coupon rate, the\ngreater the change in price when interest rates move.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRelationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/relationship-bond-prices) explaining the relationship between\nbond prices and interest rates within financial and capital markets.\n10.2\nBond Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDetermine the value (price) of a bond.\n•\nUnderstand the characteristics of and differences between discount and premium bonds.\n•\nDraw a timeline indicating bond cash flows.\n•\nDifferentiate between fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds.\n•\nDetermine bond yields.\nPricing a Bond in Steps\nWhy do we want to learn how to price a bond? The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of\nassets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller.

In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.",

                    "question": "What are the two types of cash inflows a bondholder receives from a bond investment over its term, and how are they valued?",
                    "answer": "A bondholder receives two types of cash inflows from a bond investment over its term: the payment of the par value at maturity, often referred to as the payment of the face value of the bond at term end, and the periodic coupon payments, also called interest income. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly indicated in the bond issue documentation. Bond valuation requires two different time value of money techniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together. The first present value calculation is for the par value at maturity, and the second is for the periodic coupon payments."

                    "question": "How does the relationship between bond prices and interest rates affect bond investments, particularly for normal (fixed rate) and floating-rate bonds?",
                    "answer": "The relationship between bond prices and interest rates is inverse; when interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice versa. Normal (fixed rate) bonds are subject to this inverse relationship, meaning that if interest rates increase, the value of these bonds will decline, and if interest rates decrease, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. Floating-rate bonds, however, offer protection against rising interest rates because their interest rates are tied to a benchmark interest rate that adjusts periodically. Therefore, investors who purchase normal bonds may not be pleased if the economy signals inflation and forecasts rising interest rates, as their bond investments could lose value. On the other hand, floating-rate bonds can provide stability and potentially higher returns in such scenarios."

            "chunk": "Generating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\nthrough to 10 years.\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\nthat only included long-term bonds.\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n305\nIssuers also promise to pay bondholders periodic interest or coupon payments to compensate them for the\nuse of their money over the term of the bond. The rate at which issuers pay investors, or the bond’s stated\ncoupon rate, is typically fixed at the time of issuance.\nWe have also covered the concept that bond values have an inverse relationship with interest rates. As interest\nrates rise, bond prices fall, and when interest rates fall, bond values increase. Movement of interest rates can\nhave a dramatic effect on a bond’s value and presents the typical bondholder with a number of different\nfinancial risks that we have described in detail.\nAlso in this chapter, we have discussed how bond values can be estimated through the use of several different\nfactors. Prevailing interest rates are among the most critical of these, but also important are factors such as\nmaturity periods, the taxability of bond interest, the credit standing of bond issuers, and the likelihood of bond\ncall, or issuers paying off their debt early.\nWhen considering purchasing bonds or any such fixed-income investment, investors should remain aware that\ninterest rates are always in a state of flux and can change at any time. The movements of bond values and\nbond yields will be significantly affected by these changes and can be favorable or unfavorable for any\ninvestor.\n10.5\nUsing Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate bond valuations using Excel.\n•\nDemonstrate bond yield calculations using Excel.\nCalculating the Price (Present Value) of a Bond\nThe following examples illustrate how Microsoft Excel can be used to calculate common bond problems.\nPlease be sure to refer to the chapters on the time value of money for examples of using spreadsheets to solve\npresent value problems, as these same concepts are also used in solving bond problems.\nYou can use the following steps in Excel to determine the price or present value of a coupon bond.

                    "answer": "When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and this affects an investor who needs to sell their bond before maturity because the bond's value will be lower. If an investor holds a bond yielding 7% and the economy changes so that comparable bonds yield 10%, the investor would have to lower the price of the original 7% bond until it also yields the 10% market rate. This means potential buyers would be less likely to purchase the bond at its current price, resulting in a capital loss for the investor who needs to sell it before maturity. Conversely, if prevailing bond rates fall, an investor might sell their bond at a higher price, thus earning a capital gain."

By investing in bonds with different maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can achieve superior financial returns compared to investing solely in short-term bonds. Additionally, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced by the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making it less risky than an investment consisting entirely of long-term bonds."

However, it should be noted\nthat cash flow is not always the best means of measuring financial health. A company can always sell a large\nportion of its assets to generate a positive cash flow, even if it is operating at a loss or experiencing other\nfinancial difficulties. Additionally, investors prefer to see companies reinvesting their cash back into their\nbusinesses rather than sitting on excessive balances of idle cash.\nSimilar to other models, the discounted cash flow model is only as good as the information entered. As the\ncommon expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” This can often be the case if reasonably accurate cash\nflow estimates are not available or if an unrealistic discount rate or required rate of return is used in the\ncalculations. It is always best to use several different methods when valuing companies and their common\nstock.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nPlease view this short video on discounted cash flow (https://openstax.org/r/short_video_on_discounted)\nand how this method can be applied in stock valuation.\n11.4\nPreferred Stock\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine preferred stock.\n•\nCalculate the intrinsic value of preferred stock.\n•\nUnderstand the difference between common stock and preferred stock.\nFeatures of Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock will often feature a dividend that a company is obligated to pay out before it makes any\ndividend payments to common stockholders. In cases of bankruptcy and liquidation of the issuing company,\npreferred stockholders have priority claim to assets before common stockholders. Additionally, preferred\nstockholders are usually entitled to a set (or constant) dividend every period.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, they have no maturity date, and consequently,\nthere is no final payment of the par value. The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future.

However, the model has limitations. One significant limitation is that a company can generate positive cash flow through asset sales, even if it is not profitable. Additionally, investors prefer companies to reinvest their cash rather than holding large amounts of idle cash. The DCF model's accuracy heavily depends on the quality of input data; 'garbage in, garbage out' is a relevant saying here. If cash flow estimates are inaccurate or if an unrealistic discount rate is used, the results can be misleading. Therefore, it is advisable to use multiple valuation methods to cross-check results and ensure a more robust assessment of a company's value."

An example of this calculation involves Oh-Well Heath Services Inc., which issued preferred stock with a par value of $1,000 and an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate, the intrinsic value of the preferred stock can be calculated as follows: V = $50 / 0.10 = $500.

After graduating as valedictorian of her high school class, Yellen later\nattended Yale University and was the only woman in her 1971 PhD graduating class in economics. Men have\nlong dominated the “dismal science” of economics, but Yellen has proved to be an exception.\nMotivated by an undergraduate economics professor at Pembroke College of Brown University, Yellen\nrealized how much the US central bank, known as the Federal Reserve, could influence the lives of ordinary\npeople. She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record. During her four-year tenure, the rate of unemployment\ndecreased by more than 2.5%, and employment increased in every month of her term. This is the first and\nonly time in the history of the Federal Reserve that the board chair has overseen continuous increases in\n12.2 • Historical Picture of Inflation\n365\nemployment over their entire tenure.\nNow, another first: In 2021, President Joe Biden appointed Yellen as the first woman Secretary of the\nTreasury. Yellen has a storied career and a long list of accomplishments, but surely her record of firsts will\nprove to be an important and lasting legacy for women in business, government, and economics\neverywhere.\n(Sources: Ann Saphir. “Factbox: Janet Yellen’s Road to US Treasury Secretary.” Reuters.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes.

With this dichotomy, we\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\nsecondary, securities.\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\n100 years or so.

As a consumer, you will make many financial decisions throughout your\nlife, and many of these decisions will be guided by statistical analysis. For example, what is the probability that\ninterest rates will rise over the next year, and how will that affect your decision on whether to refinance a\nmortgage? In your retirement planning, how should the investment mix be allocated among stocks and bonds\nto minimize volatility and ensure a high probability for a secure retirement? When running a business, how\ncan statistical quality control methods be used to maintain high quality levels and minimize waste? Should a\nbusiness make use of consumer focus groups or customer surveys to obtain business intelligence data to\nimprove service levels? These questions and more can benefit from the use and application of statistical\nmethods.\nRunning a business and tracking its finances is a complex process. From day-to-day activities such as\nmanaging inventory levels to longer-range activities such as developing new products or expanding a\ncustomer base, statistical methods are a key to business success. For finance considerations, a business must\nmanage risk versus return and optimize investments to ensure shareholder value.

The most widely used measures of the center of a\ndata set are the mean (average), median, and mode. The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of the\naverage. We will discuss the geometric mean later.\nNote that the words mean and average are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the\nother is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and average technically refers only to a\ncenter location. Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data.

                    "answer": "The empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, provides a guideline for the spread of data in a normal distribution. According to the rule, approximately 68% of the data lies within one standard deviation of the mean, meaning it falls between the mean minus one standard deviation and the mean plus one standard deviation. Similarly, about 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean, implying it ranges from the mean minus two standard deviations to the mean plus two standard deviations. Furthermore, around 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of the mean, indicating that it is bounded by the mean minus three standard deviations and the mean plus three standard deviations. This rule helps in understanding the dispersion of data points around the mean in a normal distribution."

On the x-axis, you would have the age groups, while the y-axis would represent the number of users or the percentage of users in each age group. Each bar would correspond to an age group, and its height would indicate the number of users or the percentage of users in that age group. This visual representation allows for easy comparison of the proportions of users across different age groups, providing insights into the demographic makeup of the user base."

An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any\nassumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based on that updated information.\nExcel is a versatile tool with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of\nstraightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.\nSuppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this\nproject is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to\nincrease by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know\nthat your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.\nCalculating NPV Using Excel\nTo calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row\n5 in Figure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is\nshown in row 6.\nFigure 16.4 Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.5 shows the present value of each year’s cash flow resulting from the formula. The NPV is then\ncalculated by summing the present values of the cash flows.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet-file) containing key Chapter 16\nExcel exhibits.\nFigure 16.5 NPV Calculated by Summing Present Values of Cash Flows ($ except Cost of Funds)\nAlternatively, Excel is programmed with financial functions, including a calculation for NPV. The NPV formula is\nshown in cell J7 in Figure 16.6 below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\n496\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nperiod zero at the beginning of the project. The NPV function in cell J6 will return $56,947 for this project. You\nmust subtract the initial cash outflow of $30,000 that occurs at time 0 to get the NPV of $26,947 for the project.\nWhen entering the Excel-programmed NPV function, you must remember to include references only to the\ncells that contain cash flows from year 1 to the end of the project. Then, subtract the initial investment of year\n0 to calculate NPV according to the standard definition of NPV—the present values of the cash inflows minus\nthe present value of the cash outflow. Note: Because of the nonstandard use of the term NPV by Excel, many\nusers prefer to use the method described above rather than this predefined function.\nFigure 16.6 NPV Formula ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nCalculating IRR Using Excel\nExcel also provide a function for calculating IRR. This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\nthe NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project. Figure 16.8 shows the\ncompleted spreadsheet.\nFigure 16.7 Function for Calculating IRR ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nFigure 16.8 Final Spreadsheet ($ except IRR/Cost of Funds)\nUsing Excel to Create an NPV Profile\nFirms often do not know exactly what their cost of attracting capital is, so they must use estimates in their\ndecision-making. Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\nchanges in financing costs. Excel simplifies the creation of an NPV profile.\nMiddleton Manufacturing is considering installing solar panels to heat water and provide lighting throughout\nits plant. To do so will cost the company $800,000 this year. However, this upgrade will save the company an\nestimated $150,000 in electrical costs each year for the next 10 years. Constructing an NPV profile of this\nproject will allow Middleton to see how the NPV of the project changes with the cost of attracting funds.",

For a hypothetical project costing $30,000 this year with expected cash inflows of $6,000 next year and increasing by $2,000 annually until reaching $18,000 in year 7, at a cost of funds of 9%, you could use Excel to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV). Initially, you would input the cash flows into an Excel sheet. One method involves manually applying the discounting formula to each cash flow. Alternatively, you can use Excel's built-in NPV function, which requires specifying the discount rate and the range of cash flows excluding the initial investment. After calculating the NPV using either method, you must subtract the initial investment to arrive at the standard NPV value, which in this case would be $26,947. This process allows for easy adjustments to assumptions and recalculation of NPV based on updated information."

You estimate that the company’s retained\nearnings will be $10 million this year. If the company needs to issue new shares of stock, flotation costs are\nexpected to be $0.75 per share.\nGiven this information, you are tasked with calculating the company’s WACC. You need to provide an\nestimate of WACC if retained earnings are used and an estimate if new equity must be issued.\nSolution:\nFirst, calculate the cost of equity capital for AMW using the constant dividend growth model:\nUsing 12.57% as the equity cost of capital and 4.6% as the after-tax cost of debt, the WACC is calculated as\nThe WACC for AMW when it is using retained earnings for equity financing is 10.18%.

These corporate bonds have a provision that gives the bondholder\nthe option of converting each bond held into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The number of\ncommon shares the bondholder would receive for each bond is known as the conversion ratio.\nSuppose that you own a convertible bond issued by Sheridan Sodas with a face value of $1,000 and a\nconversion ratio of 20 shares that matures today. If you convert the bond today, you will receive 20 shares of\nSheridan common stock. If you do not convert, you will receive $1,000. If you convert, you are basically paying\n$1,000 for 20 shares of Sheridan stock. The conversion price is\nIf Sheridan is trading for more\nthan $50 per share, you would want to convert. If Sheridan is trading for less than $50 per share, you would\nnot want to convert; you would prefer the $1,000. In other words, you will choose to convert whenever the\nstock price exceeds the conversion price at maturity.\nA convertible bond gives the holder an option; the bondholder is able to choose between the face value cash\nor receiving shares of stock. Options always have a positive value to holders. It is always preferable to be able\nto choose $1,000 or shares of stock than to simply be given $1,000. There is a possibility that the shares of\nstock will be more valuable, and there is no way the choice can put you in a worse position.\nBecause holders of convertible bonds have the valuable option of conversion that holders of nonconvertible\nbonds do not have, convertible debt can be offered with a lower interest rate. It might seem as if the firm\ncould lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.\nHowever, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer\nto convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can\nconvert to is worth more than $1,000. Only when the price of the stock has increased enough that the value of\nthe stock received is more than $1,000 will the bondholders convert. However, this means that instead of\npaying $1,000, the firm is paying the bondholder in stock worth more than $1,000. In essence, the firm (and\nthe current shareholders) would be selling an equity position in the company for less than the market price of\nthat equity position. The lower interest rate compensates for the possibility that conversion will occur.\n528\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n17.1 The Concept of Capital Structure\nCapital structure refers to how a company finances its assets. The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are",

This is called forecasting. Accounting and finance professionals use past performance\nalong with what they know about the business, its competitors, the economy, and the company’s plans for the\nfuture to assemble detailed financial forecasts. Forecasts are useful to many individuals for different reasons.\nA budget, a type of static forecast, helps accountants and managers see how their plans for the coming year\ncan be achieved. It outlines sales targets and how much can be spent on cost of goods sold and expenses to\nachieve the company’s bottom-line (net income) targets. Investors use financial forecasts to help guide their\ndecisions to buy, sell or hold stocks or to estimate future potential income through dividends. Perhaps most\nimportantly, for our purposes in finance, forecasts are used to help predict and manage cash flows.\nA business can have all the profit in the world at the end of the year, but if it doesn’t raise enough cash\n(liquidity) to pay the bills and pay its employees halfway through the year, it could still go bankrupt despite\nbeing profitable. Forecasting sales and expenses helps assemble a cash forecast—when sales will be collected\nand when expenses will be paid—so that financial managers can look forward far enough to have enough time\nto react accordingly and secure short- or long-term financing to meet gaps in cash flow.\nFinancial Forecasting\n18\n18 • Why It Matters\n535\n18.1\nThe Importance of Forecasting\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how to use financial statements in forecasting firm financials.\n•\nExplain why balance sheet items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\n•\nExplain why income statement items are important in forecasting a firm’s financial result.\nIn this section, we will briefly review some of the basic elements of financial statements and how we can\nanalyze historical statements to help assemble financial forecasts. Financial forecasting is important to short-\nand long-term firm success. It helps a firm plan for the resources it will need, ensuring it will have enough cash\non hand at the right time to cover daily operations and capital expenditures. It helps the firm communicate its\nfuture potential and manage its shareholders’ expectations. It also helps management assess future risk and\nset plans in place to mitigate that risk.\nFinancial forecasting involves using historical data, analysis tools, and other information we can gather to\nmake an educated guess about the future financial performance of the firm. Historical figures provide a\nreasonable starting point. We use tools such as ratios, common size, and trend analysis to fine-tune our\nforecast. And finally, we assess what we know about the firm, its competitors, the economy, and anything else\nthat might impact performance and further fine-tune our forecast from there.\nIt’s important to take a moment to consider the role of ethics in forecasting. Ethics is a huge issue in the world\nof accounting and finance in general, and forecasting is no different. There can be tremendous pressure on\nmanagement to perform, to deliver certain levels of profit, and to meet shareholder expectations.\nForecasting, as you will learn throughout this chapter, is not an exact science. There is a great deal of\nsubjectivity that can come into play when forecasting sales and expenses. Ethical behavior is crucial in this\narea. Those who create forecasts must have a firm understanding of where their data comes from, how\nreliable it is, and whether or not their assumptions and projections are reasonably justified.\nFinancial Statement Foundations\nIn Financial Statements, you were introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. You learned about\nthe four key financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, statement of stockholders’\nequity, and statement of cash flows.

We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the\naccounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all\ncurrent and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and\nequity. In Figure 18.2, we see that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has total assets of $250,000 in the current year,\nwhich balances with its total liabilities and equity of $250,000.\n536\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.2 Balance Sheet\nThe income statement reflects the performance of the firm over a period of time. It includes net sales, cost of\ngoods sold, operating expenses, and net income. In Figure 18.3, we see that Clear Lake had $120,000 in net\nsales, $60,000 in cost of goods sold, and $35,000 in net income in the current year.\nFigure 18.3 Full Income Statement\nFinally, the statement of cash flows is used to reconcile net income to cash balances. The statement begins\nwith net income, then reflects adjustments to balance sheet accounts and noncash expenses. The statement of\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n537\ncash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to\nclearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance. This means that total assets\n(what the company owns) must equal total liabilities and equity (what the company owes).\n538\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to\nuse elements of the balance sheet to assess financial health. Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis.

They may adjust rent and see if they can find a better retail\nlocation to either reduce costs or increase sales due to increased foot traffic in a new location. They may save\nan entirely new version of the forecast and change it drastically to see what investing in opening a second\nretail location would do.\nAs you can see, the list of possibilities is endless. Though the main goal of financial managers may be cash\nplanning, the power of a well-developed forecast is tremendous. It can help assess potential growth, new\nopportunities, and even small changes in the business as well.\nSensitivity Analysis in Forecasting\nSensitivity analysis will often look at the change in just one variable rather than the entire scenario. It\nexamines how sensitive a particular output (commonly net income) will be to a change in a particular\nunderlying input (sales or costs, for example). What if sales are 10% more or less than forecasted? What if the\nprices the firm can charge its customers are 10% more or less? What if the cost of goods sold increases by\n10%? The purpose is to see which variables are crucial to “get right.” It isn’t worth spending a lot of research\ndollars to make sure you are accurately predicting a variable if that variable won’t notably change the\noutcome. However, a slight change in other variables may have significant impact.\nUsing pro forma financial statements created in Excel allows management to quickly generate new pro forma\nfinancials and see the impact that each possible variable might have on the overall financial results.\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n553\n18.6\nUsing Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a financial statement forecast using spreadsheet tools.\n•\nConnect the balance sheet and income statement using appropriate formula referencing.\n•\nUse spreadsheet functions to generate appropriate iterations that balance financial forecasts.\nThroughout this chapter, we have seen forecasted financial statements for Clear Lake Sporting Goods along\nwith its forecasted cash flow. These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that\nwouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be\nquite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just\none common option, Microsoft Excel.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file) containing key Chapter 18\nExcel exhibits.\nUsing the “Sheet”\nCreating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of\nthe business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.\nCreating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the\npower of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.",

The establishment of and changes to credit terms are usually made in\nconsultation with the sales and financial management departments.\nMonitoring Accounts Receivables\nFinancial managers monitor accounts receivables using some basic tools. One of those tools is the accounts\nreceivable aging schedule (report). To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice). For example, if a credit sale was made on\nJune 1 and is still unpaid on July 15, that receivable is 45 days old. Aging of accounts is thought to be a useful\ntool because of the idea that the longer the time owed, the greater the possibility that individual accounts\nreceivable will prove to be uncollectible.\nAn aging schedule is a report that organizes the outstanding (unpaid) receivable balances into age categories.\nThe receivables are grouped by the length of time they have been outstanding, and an uncollectible\npercentage is assigned to each category. The length of uncollectible time increases the percentage assigned.\nFor example, a category might consist of accounts receivable that are 0–30 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 6 percent. Another category might be 31–60 days past due and is assigned an\nuncollectible percentage of 15 percent. All categories of estimated uncollectible amounts are summed to get a\ntotal estimated uncollectible balance.\nThe aging of accounts is useful to the credit and collection managers, both from a global view—estimating\nhow much of the accounts receivable asset might be bad debts—and on a micro basis—being able to drill\ndown to see which specific customers are slow paying or delinquent so as to implement collection tactics.\nAccountants and auditors also find the aging of accounts to determine a reasonable amount to be reported as\nbad debt expense and to establish a sufficient balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt\nexpense is the cost of doing business because some customers will not pay the amounts they owe (accounts\nreceivable), while the allowance for doubtful accounts is a contra-asset (it will be deducted from accounts\nreceivable on the balance sheet) that contains management’s best guess (management’s estimate) as to how\nmuch of its accounts receivable will never be collected.\nIn Figure 19.6, Foodinia Inc.’s accounts receivable aging report shows that the total receivables balance is\n$189,000. The company splits its accounts into four age categories: not due, 30 to 60 days past due, 61 to 90\ndays past due, and more than 90 days past due. Of the $189,000 owed to Foodinia by its customers, $75,500\n($189,000 less $113,500) of invoices have been outstanding (not paid yet) beyond their due dates.\n19.4 • Receivables Management\n581\nFigure 19.6 Foodinia Inc. Aging of Accounts Receivable Schedule\nIn addition to preparing aging schedules, financial managers also use financial ratios to monitor receivables.\nThe accounts receivable turnover ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are\ncollected during an operating period and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that\nreceivables are collected quickly. In contrast, a lower accounts receivable turnover indicates that receivables\nare collected at a slower rate, taking more days to collect from a customer.\nAnother receivables ratio is the number of days’ sales in receivables ratio, also called the receivables collection\nperiod—the expected days it will take to convert accounts receivable into cash. A comparison of a company’s\nreceivables collection period to the credit terms granted to customers can alert management to collection\nproblems. Both the accounts receivable turnover ratio and receivables collection period are covered, including\nthe formulas for calculating the ratios, in the previous section of this chapter.\nAccounts Receivables and Notes Receivable\nAn accounts receivable is an informal arrangement between a seller (a company) and customer. Accounts\nreceivable are usually paid within a month or two. Accounts receivable don’t require any complex paperwork,\nare evidenced by an invoice, and do not involve interest payments. In contrast, a note receivable is a more\nformal arrangement that is evidence by a legal contract called a promissory note specifying the payment\namount and date and interest.\nThe length of a note receivable can be for any time period including a term longer than the typical account\nreceivable. Some notes receivable have a term greater than a year. The assets of a bank include many notes\nreceivable (a loan made by a bank is an asset for the bank).\nA note receivable can be used in exchange for products and services or in exchange for cash (usually in the\ncase of a financial lender). Sometimes a company might request that a slow-paying customer sign a note",

                    "answer": "Establishing and changing credit terms typically involve consultation with the sales and financial management departments. This is necessary because these departments have unique insights into customer behavior and financial health, which can significantly impact the success of credit policies. Sales teams interact directly with customers and understand their payment patterns and creditworthiness, while financial management provides crucial data on the company's financial health and the potential risks associated with extending credit. Together, their input helps create credit terms that balance customer satisfaction with the need to manage risk and maintain cash flow."
