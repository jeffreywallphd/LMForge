The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise.",

Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute.

In the United States, the Constitution holds supreme authority, meaning that any statute or judicial decision that conflicts with the Constitution is invalid. For instance, if a state law or court ruling contradicts the First Amendment's protection of free speech, it would be deemed unconstitutional and thus void."

Conduct \nthat is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment—\nan environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s \npurview. Likewise, if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive, the \nconduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim’s employment, and there is no Title VII \nviolation. \n \nBut Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A \ndiscriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees’ \npsychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees’ job performance, discourage \nemployees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even \nwithout regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe \nor pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n36 \nreligion, or national origin offends Title VII’s broad rule of workplace equality.

Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test.

And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections.

Similarly, although doubles tend to jackknife somewhat more than \nsingles, 65-foot doubles actually are less likely to jackknife than 60-foot doubles. \n \nStatistical studies supported the view that 65-foot doubles are at least as safe overall as 55-foot singles and \n60-foot doubles. One such study, which the District Court credited, reviewed Consolidated’s comparative \naccident experience in 1978 with its own singles and doubles. Each kind of truck was driven 56 million \nmiles on identical routes. The singles were involved in 100 accidents resulting in 27 injuries and one \nfatality. The 65-foot doubles were involved in 106 accidents resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Iowa’s \nexpert statistician admitted that this study provided “moderately strong evidence” that singles have a \nhigher injury rate than doubles.

A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages.

Corporations afford the inestimable benefit of limited liability, partnerships \nthe inestimable benefit of limited taxation. Businesspeople always seek to limit their risk and their \ntaxation. \n \nAt base, whether to allow businesspeople and investors to grasp the holy grail of limited liability is a \npolitical issue. When we say a person is “irresponsible,” it means he (or she, or it) does not take \nresponsibility for his harmful actions; the loss is borne by others. Politically speaking, there is an \nincentive to allow businesspeople insulation from liability: it encourages them to take risks and \ninvest, thus stimulating economic activity and forestalling unemployment. So the political trade-off \nwith allowing various inventive forms of business organization is between providing business actors \nwith the security that they will lose only their calculable investment, thus stimulating the economy,",

Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\nHistorical Trends in GDP\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\nyears.\n5\n“GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n81\nFigure 3.12 Growth of the US GDP6 Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of US output, is the market value of the\ngoods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.

Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\n298\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 10.7 Yield Curve in February 2021\nA yield curve with an inverted (downward-sloping) shape is considered unusual and will occur when long-\nterm rates are lower than short-term rates. This causes the yield curve to assume an inverted shape with a\nnegative slope. An inverted yield curve has historically been observed as a prelude to a general decline in\neconomic activity and interest rate levels. In some countries, such as the United States, an inverted yield\ncurve has been associated with upcoming recession and economic contraction.\nThis may occur because central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, will often attempt\nto stimulate a stagnant economy by reducing interest rates. Essentially, the potential actions of the central\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but",

                    "answer": "A beta value less than 1.0 indicates that a stock has lower volatility compared to its benchmark. Beta is calculated as the slope of the regression line when the stock returns are plotted against the returns for the benchmark. For instance, in the given example, the beta of Nike stock was determined to be 0.83, indicating that Nike stock had lower volatility relative to the S&P 500 during the specified period."

The goal in the\nregression analysis is to determine the coefficients a and b in the following regression equation:\n.\nTypically some technology, such as Excel, R statistical tool, or a calculator, is used to generate the coefficients a\nand b since manual calculations are cumbersome.\n14.4 Regression Applications in Finance\nRegression analysis is used extensively in finance-related applications. Many typical applications involve\ndetermining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and\nthe Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is\nobserved, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance. If the correlation coefficient is\nsignificant, a linear model can then be generated and used for predictions.\n14.5 Predictions and Prediction Intervals\nA key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to then use the model for predictions, provided that\nthe correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute\nthe value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\nvariable (y). When making predictions using the linear model, it is generally recommended to only predict\nvalues for y using values of x that are in the original range of the data collection.\n14.6 Use of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry and can be found online\n(https://openstax.org/r/finance_industry). R provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis,\ngraphing, and correlation and regression analysis. R is increasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical\ntool because it is an open-source language and additional features are constantly being added by the user\ncommunity. The tool can be used on many different computing platforms.\nKey Terms\nbest-fit linear regression model\nan equation of the form\nthat provides the best-fit straight line\nto the (x, y) data points\nbeta\nthe measure of the volatility of a stock as compared to a benchmark such as the S&P 500 index\n442\n14 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncorrelation",

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive\nmarket. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the\nmarket value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field\nof finance as MM Proposition I.\nVisit Milken Institute’s 5-Minute Finance site to explore more about Modigliani and Miller’s contributions\n(https://openstax.org/r/Modigliani) to the understanding of capital structure.\nThe value of your T-shirt business remains at $45,614.

Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders.
