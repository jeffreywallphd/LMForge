Criminal cases, on the other hand, involve a governmental decision—whether state or federal—to prosecute someone for violating society’s laws. A criminal case is initiated by the government, not a private individual or organization, and the defendant is charged with breaking a law that is considered to be a violation of society as a whole, not just a violation of another individual or organization's rights."

This basket is divided into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services."
