However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589 \nNew Jersey led the way in 1875 with a general incorporation statute that greatly liberalized the powers of \nmanagement and lifted many of the former restrictions. The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble \nAct in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one \nhundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies. Although early \ncorporate laws in the United States were fairly restrictive, once states began to “sell” incorporation for tax \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n590 \nrevenues, the popularity of liberal and corporate-friendly laws caught on, especially in Delaware beginning in \n1899. A corporation remains a creature of the state—that is, the state in which it is incorporated. Delaware \nremains the state of choice because more corporations are registered there than in any other state. \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. If the English Parliament had not enacted the Bubble Act in 1720, would the “bubble” have burst? If so, \nwhat would have been the consequences to corporate development? \n2. What were some of the key components of early US corporate laws? What was the rationale behind these \nlaws? \n3.

A corporation may use liquidation proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act or \nmay be reorganized under Chapter 11 of the act. Both remedies are discussed in detail in Chapter 27 \n\"Bankruptcy\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nDissolution is the end of the legal existence of a corporation. It usually occurs after liquidation, which is the \nprocess of paying debts and distributing assets. There are several methods by which a corporation may be \ndissolved. The first is voluntary dissolution, which is an elective decision to dissolve the entity. A second is \ninvoluntary dissolution, which occurs upon the happening of statute-specific events such as a failure to pay \ntaxes.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution. Hence the acquisition of Alad I’s assets was not in the nature of a merger or",

But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument. It does not matter in what capacity she signs, whether as maker or \ncomaker, drawer or codrawer, or indorser. As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party. When words of \nguaranty do not specify the type, the law presumes a payment guaranty. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n789 \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe modern law of commercial paper is, in general, covered by UCC Article 3. The two basic types of \ncommercial paper are drafts and notes. The note is a two-party instrument whereby one person (maker) \npromises to pay money to a second person (payee). The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. What are the two basic types of commercial paper? \n2. What are the two types of drafts? \n3. What kind of commercial paper is a check? \n \n  \n \n[1] Norton v. Knapp, 19 N.W. 867 (IA 1884). \n[2] Uniform Commercial Code, Section 1-201(21). \n \n \n19.3 Requirements for Negotiability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Know what is required for an instrument to be negotiable. \n \n \nOverview \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n790 \nWhether or not a paper is negotiable is the first of our four major questions, and it is one that nonlawyers \nmust confront. Auditors, retailers, and financial institutions often handle notes and checks and usually \nmust make snap judgments about negotiability. Unless the required elements of Sections 3-103 and 3-104 \nof the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are met, the paper is not negotiable. Thus the paper meets the \nfollowing criteria: \n1. It must be in writing. \n2. It must be signed by the maker or drawer. \n3. It must be an unconditional promise or order to pay. \n4. It must be for a fixed amount in money. \n5. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time. \n6. It must be payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. \n \nThis definition states the basic premise of a negotiable instrument: the holder must be able to ascertain all \nessential terms from the face of the instrument. \nAnalysis of Required Elements \nIn Writing \nUnder UCC Section 1-201, “written” or “writing” includes “printing, typewriting or any other intentional \nreduction to tangible form.” That definition is broad—so broad, in fact, that from time to time the \nnewspapers report checks written on material ranging from a girdle (an Ohio resident wanted to make his \ntax payment stretch) to granite. Since these are tangible materials, the checks meet the writing \nrequirement. The writing can be made in any medium: ink, pencil, or even spray paint, as was the case \nwith the granite check. Of course, there is a danger in using pencil or an ink that can be erased, since the \ndrawer might be liable for alterations. For example, if you write out in pencil a check for $10 and someone \nerases your figures and writes in $250, you may lose your right to protest when the bank cashes it. \n \nSigned by the Maker or Drawer \nSignature is not limited to the personal handwriting of one’s name. “Any symbol executed or adopted by a \nparty with present intention to authenticate a writing” will serve.

As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, \nBruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary \nobligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” \n \nAgain, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in \nher Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation. Inasmuch as Behnfeldt does not have a property interest \nin the Honda, Behnfeldt is not a debtor. Having granted the security interest, Bruno is the debtor. Because \nBehnfeldt is a principal obligor, she is not a secondary obligor. Whatever the outcome of enforcement of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1024 \nthe security interest against the Honda or Bruno’s secondary obligation, Bruno will look to Behnfeldt for \nher losses. The enforcement will not affect Behnfeldt’s aggregate obligations.” \nSecured party is “a person in whose favor a security interest is created or provided for under a security \nagreement,” and it includes people to whom accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory \nnotes have been sold; consignors; and others under Section 9-102(a)(72). \n \nChattel mortgage means “a debt secured against items of personal property rather than against land, \nbuildings and fixtures.” [7] \n \nProperty Subject to the Security Interest \nNow we examine what property may be put up as security—collateral. Collateral is—again—property that \nis subject to the security interest. It can be divided into four broad categories: goods, intangible property, \nindispensable paper, and other types of collateral. \n \nGoods \nTangible property as collateral is goods. Goods means “all things that are movable when a security interest \nattaches. The term includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a \nconveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be \ngrown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes. The term \nalso includes a computer program embedded in goods.” [8] Goods are divided into several subcategories; \nsix are taken up here. \n \nConsumer Goods \nThese are “goods used or bought primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” [9] \n \nInventory \n“Goods, other than farm products, held by a person for sale or lease or consisting of raw materials, works \nin progress, or material consumed in a business.” [10] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1025 \n \nFarm Products \n“Crops, livestock, or other supplies produced or used in farming operations,” including aquatic goods \nproduced in aquaculture. [11] \n \nEquipment \nThis is the residual category, defined as “goods other than inventory, farm products, or consumer \ngoods.” [12] \n \nFixtures \nThese are “goods that have become so related to particular real property that an interest in them arises \nunder real property law.” [13] Examples would be windows, furnaces, central air conditioning, and \nplumbing fixtures—items that, if removed, would be a cause for significant reconstruction. \n \nAccession \nThese are “goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the \noriginal goods is lost.” [14] A new engine installed in an old automobile is an accession. \n \nIntangible Property \nTwo types of collateral are neither goods nor indispensible paper: accounts and general intangibles. \n \nAccounts \nThis type of intangible property includes accounts receivable (the right to payment of money), insurance \npolicy proceeds, energy provided or to be provided, winnings in a lottery, health-care-insurance \nreceivables, promissory notes, securities, letters of credit, and interests in business entities. [15] Often there \nis something in writing to show the existence of the right—such as a right to receive the proceeds of \nsomebody else’s insurance payout—but the writing is merely evidence of the right. The paper itself doesn’t \nhave to be delivered for the transfer of the right to be effective; that’s done by assignment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1026 \nGeneral Intangibles \nGeneral intangibles refers to “any personal property, including things in action, other than accounts, \ncommercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-\ncredit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction.” General \nintangibles include payment intangibles and software. [16] \n \nIndispensable Paper \nThis oddly named category is the middle ground between goods—stuff you can touch—and intangible \nproperty. It’s called “indispensable” because although the right to the value—such as a warehouse",

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality",

If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the\naccounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or\nDouble-Entry Accounting\nAccounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:\n•\nEach time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\n•\nNot only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\nimpacted.\n•\nThe sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple\nbut detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\nDebits and Credits\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary. We can illustrate\neach account type and its corresponding debit and credit effects in the form of an expanded equation (see\nFigure 4.4).\n106\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 4.4 Expanded Accounting Equation\nAs we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets accounts increase on the debit side and\ndecrease on the credit side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts. Liabilities increase on the\ncredit side and decrease on the debit side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts. This\nbecomes easier to understand as you become familiar with the normal balance of an account.\nThe balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (see Figure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one\nsection and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken\ndown on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and\ntransparency. Current assets are those that are consumed within a year. Assets that will be in use longer than\na year are considered noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be due within a year. Noncurrent\nliabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future.\nFigure 4.5 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent. Also highlighted are the various activities that affect the equity (or net worth) of the business.\nNotice each account subcategory (Current Assets and Noncurrent Assets, for example) has an “increase” side\nand a “decrease” side. As you may recall, these are called T-accounts, and they are used to analyze\ntransactions.\nThe basic components of even the simplest accounting system are accounts and a general ledger. An account\nis a record showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and equity—the basic components found in\nthe accounting equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a\ncompany maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s\naccounts with their individual balances.\n4.3\nHow Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.\n•\nExplain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.\n•\nAssess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.",

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect.

The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and",

The length of the loan, coupled with the frequent compounding,\nemphasizes this. In month 10, the interest and principal amounts “pass” each other, and now the loan balance\nis dropping at a quicker rate. Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000\nborrowing. If you pay off this mortgage over 240 months as planned, the interest cost represents an additional\n28% of the full cost of the home!\nIf the borrower has the means to make an accelerated payment against this debt—for example, due to a\nbonus or other windfall—doing so can make a significant difference in the total cost of financing over the life\nof the loan. Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5\n15.92 1.077.28\n6\n16.16 1,093.44\n7\n16.40 1,109.84\n8\n16.65 1,126.49\n9\n16.90 1,143.39\n10\n17.15 1,160.54\n11\n17.41 1,177.95\n12\n17.67 1,195.62\nTable 8.6 Compounded\nInterest on a Credit Card\nStatement ($)\nBecause interest compounds monthly rather than annually, the effective annual rate is 19.56%, not the\nintuitive rate of the stated 1.5% times 12 months, or 18%. Our basic compounding formula of (1+i)^n by\nsubstitution shows:\nTo isolate the effective annual rate, we then deduct 1 because our interest calculations are based on the value\nof $1:\nTherefore, it falls to the consumer/borrower to understand the true cost of borrowing, especially when larger\ndollar amounts are involved. If we had been dealing with $10,000 rather than $1,000, the annual difference\nwould be more than $156.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA Helpful Demonstration . . .\nFrom the Corporate Finance Institute (https://openstax.org/r/Corporate_Finance_Institute) comes a fine",

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\nYield to Maturity\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM? We\ncan use our same three trusty methods: equations, a financial calculator, and Microsoft Excel (as shown at the\nend of the chapter).\n2\nAdam Hayes. “What Do Constantly Low Bond Yields Mean for the Stock Market?” Investopedia.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to isolate r on the left-hand side of the equation. Therefore, we need to\nuse a calculator or spreadsheet to solve for the bond’s YTM.\nLet’s take another bond, the Coca-Cola bond, from Table 10.1 above and again back up our time to March\n2021. If the Coca-Cola bond has just been issued in March 2021, then it would be a seven-year, semiannual\nbond with a coupon rate of 1.0% and an original price of $952.06 at the time of issue (Table 10.5).\nBond Characteristic\nDetails\nPrice (% of par)\n95.20\nCoupon rate\n1%\nMaturity date\nMarch 15, 2028\nStandard & Poor’s Rating\nA+\nCoupon payment frequency Semiannual\nFirst coupon date\nSeptember 1, 2021\nType\nCorporate\nCallable?\nYes\nTable 10.5 Overview of Coca-Cola Bond (as of March\n2021) (credit: FINRA-Markets.Morningstar)\nDetermining Bond Yield Using a Calculator\nFor the Coca-Cola bond above, what was the bond’s YTM at its issue date? This is not an easy problem to solve\nwith a mathematical formula. It is far more practical, not to mention easier, to use a financial calculator or an\nExcel spreadsheet to solve for bond prices, yields, and maturity periods.\nWe will cover Excel applications later, but we can jump into some calculator examples right now. So, to\ncalculate the yield on the Coca-Cola bond, we’ll start by entering the values we have for this bond into a\ncalculator. The values we know are as follows:\nIf the bond’s selling price was $952.06 at issue, we have all the information we need to determine the bond’s\nYTM at issue.

To covert the semiannual value into an annual\nrate, we will need multiply the calculated I/Y by 2. This gives us an amount of 1.73%.\nSo, the YTM of the Coca-Cola bond at issue date was 1.73%. It is important to know that unless otherwise\nindicated, bond yields are expressed in annual percentage terms.\nWe have just demonstrated how a calculator can be used to determine the YTM or interest rate of a bond.\nLet’s look at a few more examples that cover the most common types of bond problems.

Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for\ntrading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\nWhen a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a\nmortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a\ndebenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of\na specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.\nThe risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market\nconditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash\nflows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have\nfound that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,\nin today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance.

Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\nThe notation\nis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\ntaken from a sample. The notation\nis used to denote the sum of the data values, and\nis used to indicate\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value. Table\n13.1 lists the Treasury bill auction amounts for a sample of auctions from December 2020.\nMaturity\nAmount ($Billions)\n4-week T-bills\n$32.9\n8-week T-bills\n38.4\n13-week T-bills\n63.1\n26-week T-bills\n59.6\n52-week T-bills\n39.7\nTotal\n$233.7\nTable 13.1 United States Treasury Bill\nAuctions, December 22 and 24, 2020\n(source: Treasury Direct)\n382\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean of the amount paid for Treasury bills at auction, in billions of dollars, we use\nthe following formula:\nMedian\nTo determine the median of a data set, order the data from smallest to largest, and then find the middle value\nin the ordered data set. For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72. It is helpful to know that the most common closing price of this particular stock over the past 20\nweeks has been $72.00.\nGeometric Mean",

It is available as a free program and\nprovides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is\nincreasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional\nfeatures are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different\ncomputing platforms and can be downloaded at the R Project website (https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-\nwebsite).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the R Statistical Tool\nThere are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:\nHow to install R on different computer operating systems (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)\nIntroduction to using R (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)\nHow to import and export data using R (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R (https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)\nOnce you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the\nsymbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML\nbrowser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.\n>\nR is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then\nexecutes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a\ngraphic user interface (GUI) to R. An example of a GUI tool for R is RStudio (https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).\nThe R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator.

For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished\nfunctions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and\nassigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of\n20 to the variable named x and assign the value of 30 to the variable named y:\n> x <- 20\n> y <- 30\nThese variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplying x by y to produce the result 600:\n> x*y\n[1] 600\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,\nand call this vector example1, as follows:\n> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)\nIf we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector\nname.\n> salaries\n[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000\n> example1\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\nOften, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,",

However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the\ncompany. Because the NPV of a project is the estimate of how much value it will create, choosing the project\nwith the higher NPV is choosing the project that will create the greater value.\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nNPV\nIRR\nRegular Machine ($)\n(16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 2,835.62 14.10%\nHeavy-Duty Machine ($) (25,000) 2,000 4,000 8,000 9,000 9,000 9,000 3,970.67 13.20%\nTable 16.11\nLINK TO LEARNING\nOlympic Project Economics\nThe investment analysis procedures used by companies are also used by government entities when\nevaluating projects.

The lack of any debt in the capital structure means the firm\nwould have no financial leverage. The equity in a firm that has no financial leverage is called unlevered\nequity.\nThe Levered Firm\nNext, consider borrowing some of the money that you will need to start this T-shirt business. Although the\ncash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least\n$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed\n$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would owe\nto the lenders at the\nend of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than\n$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.\nThe $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by\nselling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be\nknown as levered equity. The equity holders expect the firm to generate $52,000 in cash flows. Debt holders\nmust be paid before equity holders, so this will leave\nfor the shareholders.\nThe expected future cash flows generated by the business are determined by the productivity of its assets, not\nthe manner in which those assets are financed. It is the present value of these expected future cash flows that\ndetermines the firm’s value. Thus, the firm’s value in perfect capital markets will not change as a result of the\ncompany taking on leverage.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMM Proposition I\nNobel laureates Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller wrote influential papers exploring capital structure\nand the cost of a firm’s capital. They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive\nmarket. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the\nmarket value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field\nof finance as MM Proposition I.\nVisit Milken Institute’s 5-Minute Finance site to explore more about Modigliani and Miller’s contributions\n(https://openstax.org/r/Modigliani) to the understanding of capital structure.\nThe value of your T-shirt business remains at $45,614. You can calculate the value of the levered equity as\nNow, shareholders are willing to pay $28,614 for ownership in this company. They expect to get $34,320 in one\nyear in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n517\nNotice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the\nlevered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly\n(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall\nway below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.\nWhen the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would\nreceive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require\nalso increases as leverage is used.\nLeverage and the WACC\nWhat happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a",

Thus far,\nwe have treated these sources as two broad categories, each with a single cost of capital. In reality, a company\nmay have different types of debt or equity, each with its own cost of capital. The same principle would apply:\nthe WACC of the firm would be calculated using the weights of each of these types multiplied by the cost of\nthat particular type of debt or equity capital.\nPreferred Shares\nAlthough our calculations of WACC thus far have assumed that companies finance their assets only through\ndebt and common equity, we saw at the beginning of the chapter that the basic WACC formula is\nIn addition to common stock, a company can raise equity capital by issuing preferred stock.

Bondholders are paid interest before preferred shareholders are paid annual dividends.\nPreferred shareholders are paid annual dividends before common shareholders are paid dividends. Should\nthe company face bankruptcy, the same priority of claimants is followed in settling claims—first bondholders,\nthen preferred stockholders, with common stockholders standing at the end of the line.\nPreferred stock shares some characteristics with debt financing. It has a promised cash flow to its holders.\nUnlike common equity, the dividend on preferred stock is fixed and known. Also, there are consequences if\nthose preferred dividends are not paid. Common shareholders cannot receive any dividends until preferred\ndividends are paid, and in some cases, preferred shareholders receive voting rights until they are paid the\ndividends that are due. However, preferred shareholders cannot force the company into bankruptcy as debt\nholders can. For tax and legal purposes, preferred stock is treated as equity.\nThe cost of the preferred equity capital is calculated using the formula\nSuppose that Greene Building Company has issued preferred stock that pays a dividend of $2.00 each year.

Note that debt financing is the cheapest\ncost of capital for Greene. The reason for this is twofold. First, because debt holders face the least amount\nof risk because they are paid first in the order of claimants, they require a lower return. Second, because\ninterest payments are tax-deductible, the interest tax shield lowers the effective cost of debt to the\n524\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompany. Preferred shareholders will require a higher rate of return than debt holders, 9.17%, because\nthey are later in the order of claimants. Common shareholders are the residual claimants, standing at the\nend of the line to receive payment. After all other claimants are paid, any remaining money belongs to the\nshareholders. If this residual amount is small, the common shareholders receive a small payment. If there is\nnothing left after all other claimants have been paid, common shareholders receive nothing. Thus, common\nshareholders have the greatest amount of risk and require the highest rate of return.\nAlso, note that the weights for debt, preferred stock, and common stock in the capital structure sum to\n100%. The company must finance 100% of its assets.\nIssuing New Common Stock\nAn existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the\nsale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to\nallow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.\nSuppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains\n$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and\n75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the\nincrease in equity. Thus, the company would be increasing its total financing by $1 million.

It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow. While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months.

The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book. One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee.

As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital.

Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit.

The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has",
