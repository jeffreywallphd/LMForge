Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] \n \nFunctions of the Law \nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and",

In response, natural-law thinkers would argue that if \nwe care about justice, every law and every legal system must be held accountable to some higher standard, \nhowever hard that may be to define. \n \nIt is easier to know what the law “is” than what the law “should be.” Equal employment laws, for example, \nhave specific statutes, rules, and decisions about racial discrimination. There are always difficult issues of \ninterpretation and decision, which is why courts will resolve differing views. But how can we know the \nmore fundamental “ought” or “should” of human equality? For example, how do we know that “all men \nare created equal” (from the Declaration of Independence)? Setting aside for the moment questions about \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n10 \nthe equality of women, or that of slaves, who were not counted as men with equal rights at the time of the \ndeclaration—can the statement be empirically proven, or is it simply a matter of a priori knowledge?

Describe the different sources of law in the US legal system and the principal institutions that create those \nlaws. \n2. Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty, and vice versa. \n3. Explain why the Constitution is “prior” and has priority over the legislative acts of a majority, whether in the \nUS Congress or in a state legislature. \n4. Describe the origins of the common-law system and what common law means. \n \n \nSources of Law \nIn the United States today, there are numerous sources of law. The main ones are (1) constitutions—both \nstate and federal, (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions. In addition, chief \nexecutives (the president and the various governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law. \n \nIn international legal systems, sources of law include treaties (agreements between states or countries) \nand what is known as customary international law (usually consisting of judicial decisions from national \ncourt systems where parties from two or more nations are in a dispute). \n \nAs you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state law may conflict with a federal law, or a \nfederal law might be contrary to an international obligation.

To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1]",

These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto.

For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions).

Charles Hardy was Forklift’s president. \nThe Magistrate found that, throughout Harris’ time at Forklift, Hardy often insulted her because of \nher gender and often made her the target of unwanted sexual innuendoes. Hardy told Harris on \nseveral occasions, in the presence of other employees, “You’re a woman, what do you know” and “We \nneed a man as the rental manager”; at least once, he told her she was “a dumbass woman.” Again in \nfront of others, he suggested that the two of them “go to the Holiday Inn to negotiate [Harris’s] \nraise.” Hardy occasionally asked Harris and other female employees to get coins from his front pants \npocket. He threw objects on the ground in front of Harris and other women, and asked them to pick \nthe objects up. He made sexual innuendoes about Harris’ and other women’s clothing. \n \nIn mid-August 1987, Harris complained to Hardy about his conduct. Hardy said he was surprised \nthat Harris was offended, claimed he was only joking, and apologized. He also promised he would",

In addition, life is still lived in \nthe short run, and there are many occasions when something short of perfect conduct is a lot more \nprofitable. \n \nSome years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell (one of the world’s largest companies) found that it was in deep \ntrouble with the public for its apparent carelessness with the environment and human rights. Consumers \nwere boycotting and investors were getting frightened, so the company took a long, hard look at its ethic \nof short-term profit maximization. Since then, changes have been made.

A criminal case based on this shredding resulted in a conviction, later overturned by the Supreme \nCourt. But it was too late.

Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad",

Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good.

(3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate.

They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics.

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders.

Before New Jersey and Delaware competed to make \nincorporation as easy as possible and beneficial to the incorporators and founders, those who wanted the \nbenefits of incorporation had to go to legislatures—usually among the states—to show a public purpose \nthat the company would serve. \nIn the late 1800s, New Jersey and Delaware changed their laws to make incorporating relatively easy. \nThese two states allowed incorporation “for any legal purpose,” rather than requiring some public \npurpose. Thus it is government (and its laws) that makes limited liability happen through the corporate \nform. That is, only through the consent of the state and armed with the charter granted by the state can a \ncorporation’s shareholders have limited liability.

[1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and \nmodeled by the top of the organization. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n72 \n \nIt’s often noted that a code of ethics is only as important as top management is willing to make it.

[6] \n \nManaging by Numbers: The Sears Auto Center Story \nIf winning is the most important thing in your life, then you must be prepared to do anything to \nwin. \n—Michael Josephson \n \nMost people want to be winners or associate with winners. As humans, our desire to associate with those \nwho have status provides plenty of incentive to glorify winners and ignore losers. But if an individual, a \nteam, or a company does whatever it takes to win, then all other values are thrown out in the goal to win \nat all costs. The desire of some people within Sears & Roebuck Company’s auto repair division to win by \ngaining higher profits resulted in the situation portrayed here. \n \nSears Roebuck & Company has been a fixture in American retailing throughout the twentieth \ncentury. At one time, people in rural America could order virtually anything (including a house) \nfrom Sears. Not without some accuracy, the company billed itself as “the place where Americans \nshop.” But in 1992, Sears was charged by California authorities with gross and deliberate fraud \nin many of its auto centers. \n \nThe authorities were alerted by a 50 percent increase in consumer complaints over a three-year \nperiod. New Jersey’s division of consumer affairs also investigated Sears Auto Centers and found \nthat all six visited by investigators had recommended unnecessary repairs.

Sears Auto Centers were the \nlargest providers of auto repair services in the state. \nThe scam was a variant on the old bait-and-switch routine. Customers received coupons in the \nmail inviting them to take advantage of hefty discounts on brake jobs. When customers came in \nto redeem their coupons, sales staffers would convince them to authorize additional repairs. As a \nmanagement tool, Sears had also established quotas for each of their sales representatives to \nmeet. \n \nUltimately, California got Sears to settle a large number of lawsuits against it by threatening to \nrevoke Sears’ auto repair license. Sears agreed to distribute $50 coupons to nearly a million \ncustomers nationwide who had obtained certain services between August 1, 1990, and January \n31, 1992.

This fits with the original reason for diversity jurisdiction in the \nConstitution—the concern that judges in one state court would favor the in-state plaintiff rather than \na nonresident defendant. Another reason there are so many diversity cases is that plaintiffs’ \nattorneys know that removal is common and that it will move the case along faster by filing in federal \ncourt to begin with. Some plaintiffs’ attorneys also find advantages in pursuing a lawsuit in federal \ncourt. Federal court procedures are often more efficient than state court procedures, so that federal \ndockets are often less crowded. This means a case will get to trial faster, and many lawyers enjoy the \nhigher status that comes in practicing before the federal bench.

The \nlowest level is that of the limited jurisdiction courts. These are usually county or municipal courts with \noriginal jurisdiction to hear minor criminal cases (petty assaults, traffic offenses, and breach of peace, \namong others) and civil cases involving monetary amounts up to a fixed ceiling (no more than $10,000 in \nmost states and far less in many states).

Explain how a lawsuit can be dismissed prior to any trial. \n2. Understand the basic principles and practices of discovery before a trial. \n \n \nThe early phases of a civil action are characterized by many different kinds of motions and a complex \nprocess of mutual fact-finding between the parties that is known as discovery. A lawsuit will start \nwith the pleadings (complaint and answer in every case, and in some cases a counterclaim by the \ndefendant against the plaintiff and the plaintiff’s reply to the defendant’s counterclaim). After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge. Motions in the \nearly stages of a lawsuit usually aim to dismiss the lawsuit, to have it moved to another venue, or to \ncompel the other party to act in certain ways during the discovery process. \n \nInitial Pleadings, and Motions to Dismiss \nThe first papers filed in a lawsuit are called the pleadings. These include the plaintiff’s complaint and then \n(usually after thirty or more days) the answer or response from the defendant. The answer may be \ncoupled with a counterclaim against the plaintiff. (In effect, the defendant becomes the plaintiff for the \nclaims she has against the original plaintiff.) The plaintiff may reply to any counterclaim by the defendant. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n108 \nState and federal rules of civil procedure require that the complaint must state the nature of the plaintiff’s \nclaim, the jurisdiction of the court, and the nature of the relief that is being asked for (usually an award of \nmoney, but sometimes an injunction, or a declaration of legal rights). In an answer, the defendant will \noften deny all the allegations of the complaint or will admit to certain of its allegations and deny others. \nA complaint and subsequent pleadings are usually quite general and give little detail. Cases can be decided \non the pleadings alone in the following situations: (1) If the defendant fails to answer the complaint, the \ncourt can enter a default judgment, awarding the plaintiff what he seeks.

The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER).

There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf. But you will not have standing to sue because your person or property was not \ndirectly injured by the moving van. Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue?

The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI).

The Constitution is a document created by the states in which certain powers are \ndelegated to the national government, and other powers are reserved to the states. This is made explicit in \nthe Tenth Amendment. \n \nSeparation of Powers and Judicial Review \nBecause the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that no single branch of the government, especially the \nexecutive branch, would be ascendant over the others, they created various checks and balances to ensure \nthat each of the three principal branches had ways to limit or modify the power of the others. This is \nknown as the separation of powers. Thus the president retains veto power, but the House of \nRepresentatives is entrusted with the power to initiate spending bills. \n \nPower sharing was evident in the basic design of Congress, the federal legislative branch.

Even though the court had recently held that state regulation of the \nsafety aspects of a federally licensed nuclear power plant was preempted, the court drew a different \nconclusion with respect to Congress’s desire to displace state tort law—even though the tort actions might \nbe premised on a violation of federal safety regulations. \n \nCipollone v. Liggett Group (1993) was a closely watched case concerning the extent of an express \npreemption provision in two cigarette labeling laws of the 1960s. The case was a wrongful death action \nbrought against tobacco companies on behalf of Rose Cipollone, a lung cancer victim who had started \nsmoking cigarette in the 1940s. The court considered the preemptive effect on state law of a provision that \nstated, “No requirement based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to \nthe advertising and promotion of cigarettes.” The court concluded that several types of state tort actions \nwere preempted by the provision but allowed other types to go forward. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn cases of conflicts between state and federal law, federal law will preempt (or control) state law because of \nthe supremacy clause. Preemption can be express or implied. In cases where preemption is implied, the court \nusually finds that compliance with both state and federal law is not possible or that a federal regulatory \nscheme is comprehensive (i.e., “occupies the field”) and should not be modified by state actions. \n \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation.

Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant.

When New York State gave an employment preference to veterans who had been state residents \nat the time of entering the military, the court declared that veterans who were new to the state were less \nlikely to get jobs and that therefore the statute interfered with the right to travel, which was deemed a \nfundamental right.

Doubles have larger capacities, \nand the trailers can be detached and routed separately if necessary. Consolidated would like to use 65-foot \ndoubles on many of its trips through Iowa. \n \nThe State of Iowa, however, by statute, restricts the length of vehicles that may use its highways.

The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver.

A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers \nagents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety \nhazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required \nto obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases.

The \nbroadest exception to this exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement is if the agency had \nno authority to issue the rule or regulation in the first place, if exhaustion of remedies would be \nimpractical or futile, or if great harm would happen should the rule or regulation continue to apply. Also, \nif the agency is not acting in good faith, the courts will hear an appeal without exhaustion. \n \nStrategies for Obtaining Judicial Review \nOnce these obstacles are cleared, the court may look at one of a series of claims. The appellant might \nassert that the agency’s action was ultra vires (UL-truh VI-reez)—beyond the scope of its authority as set \ndown in the statute. This attack is rarely successful. A somewhat more successful claim is that the agency \ndid not abide by its own procedures or those imposed upon it by the Administrative Procedure Act. \n \nIn formal rulemaking, the appellant also might insist that the agency lacked substantial evidence for the \ndetermination that it made. If there is virtually no evidence to support the agency’s findings, the court \nmay reverse. But findings of fact are not often overturned by the courts. \n \nLikewise, there has long been a presumption that when an agency issues a regulation, it has the authority \nto do so: those opposing the regulation must bear a heavy burden in court to upset it. This is not a \nsurprising rule, for otherwise courts, not administrators, would be the authors of regulations. \nNevertheless, regulations cannot exceed the scope of the authority conferred by Congress on the agency. \nIn an important 1981 case before the Supreme Court, the issue was whether the secretary of labor, acting \nthrough the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), could lawfully issue a standard \nlimiting exposure to cotton dust in the workplace without first undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. A \ndozen cotton textile manufacturers and the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, representing 175 \ncompanies, asserted that the cotton dust standard was unlawful because it did not rationally relate the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n225 \nbenefits to be derived from the standard to the costs that the standard would impose.

A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time.

Now, some states make \nit legal to use or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set \nin the United States through the Constitution’s prohibition on “cruel or unusual punishments.” \n \nIt is often said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. But there are far too many criminal laws for \nanyone to know them all. Also, because most people do not actually read statutes, the question of \n“criminal intent” comes up right away: if you don’t know that the legislature has made driving \nwithout a seat belt fastened a misdemeanor, you cannot have intended to harm society. You might \neven argue that there is no harm to anyone but yourself! \n \nThe usual answer to this is that the phrase “ignorance of the law is no excuse” means that society \n(through its elected representatives) gets to decide what is harmful to society, not you. Still, you may \nask, “Isn’t it my choice whether to take the risk of failing to wear a seat belt? Isn’t this a victimless \ncrime? Where is the harm to society?” A policymaker or social scientist may answer that your \ninjuries, statistically, are generally going to be far greater if you don’t wear one and that your choice \nmay actually impose costs on society. For example, you might not have enough insurance, so that a \npublic hospital will have to take care of your head injuries, injuries that would likely have been \navoided by your use of a seat belt. \n \nBut, as just noted, it is hard to know the meaning of some criminal laws.

Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act.

(Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.)

An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will.

That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of \nreceiving an immediate battery. If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases.

Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law.

If a defendant is convicted and \nhis conviction is upheld on appeal, he may not thereafter be reprosecuted for the same crime. \n \nSelf-Incrimination \nThe Fifth Amendment is also the source of a person’s right against self-incrimination (no person “shall be \ncompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself”). The debate over the limits of this right \nhas given rise to an immense literature. In broadest outline, the right against self-incrimination means \nthat the prosecutor may not call a defendant to the witness stand during trial and may not comment to the \njury on the defendant’s failure to take the stand. Moreover, a defendant’s confession must be excluded \nfrom evidence if it was not voluntarily made (e.g., if the police beat the person into giving a confession). \nIn Miranda v. Arizona, the Supreme Court ruled that no confession is admissible if the police have not \nfirst advised a suspect of his constitutional rights, including the right to have a lawyer present to advise \nhim during the questioning.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble.",

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong.

Intentional torts \narise from intentional acts, whereas unintentional torts often result from carelessness (e.g., when a \nsurgical team fails to remove a clamp from a patient’s abdomen when the operation is finished). Both \nintentional torts and negligent torts imply some fault on the part of the defendant. In strict liability torts, \nby contrast, there may be no fault at all, but tort law will sometimes require a defendant to make up for \nthe victim’s losses even where the defendant was not careless and did not intend to do harm. \n \nDimensions of Tort Liability \nThere is a clear moral basis for recovery through the legal system where the defendant has been careless \n(negligent) or has intentionally caused harm. Using the concepts that we are free and autonomous beings \nwith basic rights, we can see that when others interfere with either our freedom or our autonomy, we will \nusually react negatively. As the old saying goes, “Your right to swing your arm ends at the tip of my nose.” \nThe law takes this even one step further: under intentional tort law, if you frighten someone by swinging \nyour arms toward the tip of her nose, you may have committed the tort of assault, even if there is no actual \ntouching (battery). \nUnder a capitalistic market system, rational economic rules also call for no negative externalities. That is, \nactions of individuals, either alone or in concert with others, should not negatively impact third parties. \nThe law will try to compensate third parties who are harmed by your actions, even as it knows that a \nmoney judgment cannot actually mend a badly injured victim. \n \nFigure 7.1 Dimensions of Tort Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n284 \n \n \nDimensions of Tort: Fault \nTort principles can be viewed along different dimensions.

A few states \nnow permit recovery for mental distress alone (a mother’s shock at seeing her son injured by a car while \nboth were crossing the street). Other protected interests include a person’s reputation (injured by \ndefamatory statements or writings), privacy (injured by those who divulge secrets of his personal life), and \neconomic interests (misrepresentation to secure an economic advantage, certain forms of unfair \ncompetition). \n \nDimensions of Tort: Excuses \nA third element in the law of torts is the excuse for committing an apparent wrong. The law does not \ncondemn every act that ultimately results in injury. \n \nOne common rule of exculpation is assumption of risk. A baseball fan who sits along the third base line \nclose to the infield assumes the risk that a line drive foul ball may fly toward him and strike him. He will \nnot be permitted to complain in court that the batter should have been more careful or that management \nshould have either warned him or put up a protective barrier. \n \nAnother excuse is negligence of the plaintiff. If two drivers are careless and hit each other on the highway, \nsome states will refuse to permit either to recover from the other.

Damages for these injuries are \ncalled compensatory damages. \n \nIn certain instances, the courts will permit an award of punitive damages. As the \nword punitive implies, the purpose is to punish the defendant’s actions. Because a punitive award \n(sometimes called exemplary damages) is at odds with the general purpose of tort law, it is allowable only \nin aggravated situations.

Give three examples of an intentional tort—one that causes injury to a person, one that causes injury to \nproperty, and one that causes injury to a reputation. \nThe analysis of most intentional torts is straightforward and parallels the substantive crimes already \ndiscussed in Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\". When physical injury or damage to property is caused, there is \nrarely debate over liability if the plaintiff deliberately undertook to produce the harm. Certain other \nintentional torts are worth noting for their relevance to business. \n \nAssault and Battery \nOne of the most obvious intentional torts is assault and battery. Both criminal law and tort law serve to \nrestrain individuals from using physical force on others. Assault is (1) the threat of immediate harm or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n288 \noffense of contact or (2) any act that would arouse reasonable apprehension of imminent harm. Battery is \nunauthorized and harmful or offensive physical contact with another person that causes injury. \n \nOften an assault results in battery, but not always. In Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill, for example, \nthe defendant did not touch the plaintiff’s wife, but the case presented an issue of possible assault even \nwithout an actual battery; the defendant employee attempted to kiss a customer across the countertop, \ncouldn't quite reach her, but nonetheless created actionable fear (or, as the court put it, “apprehension”) \non the part of the plaintiff's wife. It is also possible to have a battery without an assault. For example, if \nsomeone hits you on the back of the head with an iron skillet and you didn’t see it coming, there is a \nbattery but no assault. Likewise, if Andrea passes out from drinking too much at the fraternity party and a \nstranger (Andre) kisses her on the lips while she is passed out, she would not be aware of any threat of \noffensive contact and would have no apprehension of any harm. Thus there has been no tort of assault, \nbut she could allege the tort of battery. (The question of what damages, if any, would be an interesting \nargument.) \n \nUnder the doctrine of transferred intent, if Draco aims his wand at Harry but Harry ducks just in time and \nthe impact is felt by Hermione instead, English law (and American law) would transfer Draco’s intent",

[1] The remains had been brought to Stern’s show by a close friend of Roche, \nChaunce Hayden, and a number of crude comments by Stern and Hayden about the remains were \nvideotaped and broadcast on a national cable television station. Roche’s sister and brother sued Howard \nStern and Infinity broadcasting and were able to get past the defendant’s motion to dismiss to have a jury \nconsider their claim. \nA plaintiff’s burden in these cases is to show that the mental distress is severe. Many states require that \nthis distress must result in physical symptoms such as nausea, headaches, ulcers, or, as in the case of the \npregnant wife, a miscarriage. Other states have not required physical symptoms, finding that shame, \nembarrassment, fear, and anger constitute severe mental distress. \n \nTrespass and Nuisance \nTrespass is intentionally going on land that belongs to someone else or putting something on someone \nelse’s property and refusing to remove it.

A New York statute makes it a misdemeanor to use the name, portrait, or \npicture of any person for advertising purposes or for the purposes of trade (business) without first \nobtaining written consent. The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country.

But in recent years, the notion of intrusion \nhas been broadened considerably. Now, taking photos of someone else with your cell phone in a locker \nroom could constitute invasion of the right to privacy.

So \ncommonplace is the concept of contract—and our freedom to make contracts with each other—that it is \ndifficult to imagine a time when contracts were rare, an age when people’s everyday associations with one \nanother were not freely determined. Yet in historical terms, it was not so long ago that contracts were \nrare, entered into if at all by very few. In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor.

Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2). One more major change was made, a revision of \nArticle 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment \nsecurities from seller to purchaser. This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for",

This section explicitly declares that serving food or drink is a sale, whether they are to be consumed \non or off the premises. \n \nThe second type of case involves blood transfusions, which can give a patient hepatitis, a serious and \nsometimes fatal disease. Hospitals and blood banks obviously face large potential liability under the UCC \nprovision just referred to on implied warranty of merchantability. Because medical techniques cannot \ndetect the hepatitis virus in any form of blood used, hospitals and blood banks would be in constant \njeopardy, without being able to take effective action to minimize the danger. Most states have enacted \nlegislation specifically providing that blood supplies to be used in transfusions are a service, not goods, \nthus relieving the suppliers and hospitals of an onerous burden. \n \nThree Basic Contract Types: Sources of Law \nWith this brief description of the UCC, it should now be clear that the primary sources of law for the three \nbasic types of contracts are: \n \n• \nReal estate: common law; \n• \nServices: common law; \n• \nSale of goods: UCC (as interpreted by the courts). \n \nCommon law and UCC rules are often similar. For example, both require good faith in the performance of \na contract. However, there are two general differences worth noting between the common law of contracts \nand the UCC’s rules governing the sales of goods. First, the UCC is more liberal than the common law in \nupholding the existence of a contract. For example, in a sales contract (covered by the UCC), “open” \nterms—that is, those the parties have not agreed upon—do not require a court to rule that no contract was \nmade.

For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding.

The courts gave \nrelief to one who wanted to collect a debt, for in such a case the creditor presumably had already given the \ndebtor something of value, and the failure of the debtor to pay up was seen as manifestly unjust. But the \nissue was less clear when neither promise had yet been fulfilled. Suppose John agrees to sell Humphrey a \nquantity of wheat in one month. On the appointed day, Humphrey refuses to take the wheat or to pay. The \nmodem law of contracts holds that a valid contract exists and that Humphrey is required to pay John. \n \nAn agreement consisting of a set of promises is called an executory contract before either promise is \ncarried out. Most executory contracts are enforceable. If one promise or set of terms has been fulfilled—if, \nfor example, John had delivered the wheat to Humphrey—the contract is called partially executed.

That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment.

In recent years, however, the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many \nstates today necessities include property and services that will enable the minor to earn a living and to \nprovide for those dependent on him. If the contract is executory, the minor can simply disaffirm. If the \ncontract has been executed, however, the minor must face more onerous consequences.

That the adult reasonably believed the minor was also \nan adult is of no consequence in a contract suit. But some states have enacted statutes that make the \nminor liable in certain situations.

In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright.

Surely it is well known in Vermont dairy country that dairy farmers can’t simply stop milking cows when no \nprocessing plant is available to take the milk—the cows will soon stop producing. Why was EBWS then not \nentitled to those damages which it will certainly suffer when the creamery is down for repairs? \n3. Britly (the contractor) must have known EBWS had employees that would be idled when the creamery shut \ndown for repairs. Why was it not liable for their lost wages? \n4. What could EBWS have done at the time of contracting to protect itself against the damages it would incur \nin the event the creamery suffered downtime due to faulty construction? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n365 \n \n \n \n \n8.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nIn this chapter we have seen that two fundamental sources of contract law are the common law as \ndeveloped in the state courts and as summarized in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, and the \nUniform Commercial Code for the sale of goods. \n \nSales law is a special type of contract law, governed by Article 2 of the UCC. Article 2 governs the sale of \ngoods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. When the goods \nare “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies. For two categories \nof goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood \nsupplied for transfusions is not. \n \nTypes of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-\ncontracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) \ncompleted (executed) and uncompleted (executory). To understand contract law, it is necessary to master \nthese distinctions and their nuances. \n \nIn order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be",

In the next chapter we will turn to \nrelationships involving third parties. \n \nTypes of Agents \nThere are five types of agents. \n \n \nGeneral Agent \nThe general agent possesses the authority to carry out a broad range of transactions in the name and on \nbehalf of the principal. The general agent may be the manager of a business or may have a more limited \nbut nevertheless ongoing role—for example, as a purchasing agent or as a life insurance agent authorized \nto sign up customers for the home office. In either case, the general agent has authority to alter the \nprincipal’s legal relationships with third parties. One who is designated a general agent has the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n374 \nto act in any way required by the principal’s business. To restrict the general agent’s authority, the \nprincipal must spell out the limitations explicitly, and even so the principal may be liable for any of the \nagent’s acts in excess of his authority. \n \nNormally, the general agent is a business agent, but there are circumstances under which an individual \nmay appoint a general agent for personal purposes. One common form of a personal general agent is the \nperson who holds another’s power of attorney. This is a delegation of authority to another to act in his \nstead; it can be accomplished by executing a simple form, such as the one shown in Figure 9.2 \"General \nPower of Attorney\". Ordinarily, the power of attorney is used for a special purpose—for example, to sell \nreal estate or securities in the absence of the owner. But a person facing a lengthy operation and \nrecuperation in a hospital might give a general power of attorney to a trusted family member or friend. \n \nFigure 9.2 General Power of Attorney \n \nSpecial Agent \nThe special agent is one who has authority to act only in a specifically designated instance or in a \nspecifically designated set of transactions. For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer",

For example, a real estate broker is usually a special agent hired \nto find a buyer for the principal’s land. Suppose Sam, the seller, appoints an agent Alberta to find a buyer \nfor his property. Alberta’s commission depends on the selling price, which, Sam states in a letter to her, \n“in any event may be no less than $150,000.” If Alberta locates a buyer, Bob, who agrees to purchase the \nproperty for $160,000, her signature on the contract of sale will not bind Sam. As a special agent, Alberta \nhad authority only to find a buyer; she had no authority to sign the contract. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n375 \n \nAgency Coupled with an Interest \nAn agent whose reimbursement depends on his continuing to have the authority to act as an agent is said \nto have an agency coupled with an interest if he has a property interest in the business. A literary or \nauthor’s agent, for example, customarily agrees to sell a literary work to a publisher in return for a \npercentage of all monies the author earns from the sale of the work. The literary agent also acts as a \ncollection agent to ensure that his commission will be paid. By agreeing with the principal that the agency \nis coupled with an interest, the agent can prevent his own rights in a particular literary work from being \nterminated to his detriment. \n \nSubagent \nTo carry out her duties, an agent will often need to appoint her own agents. These appointments may or \nmay not be authorized by the principal. An insurance company, for example, might name a general agent \nto open offices in cities throughout a certain state. The agent will necessarily conduct her business \nthrough agents of her own choosing. These agents are subagents of the principal if the general agent had \nthe express or implied authority of the principal to hire them. For legal purposes, they are agents of both \nthe principal and the principal’s general agent, and both are liable for the subagent’s conduct although \nnormally the general agent agrees to be primarily liable (see Figure 9.3 \"Subagent\"). \n \nFigure 9.3 Subagent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n376 \n \n \nServant \nThe final category of agent is the servant.

Until the early nineteenth century, any employee whose work \nduties were subject to an employer’s control was called a servant; we would not use that term so broadly \nin modern English. The Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, defines a servant as “an agent \nemployed by a master [employer] to perform service in his affairs whose physical conduct in the \nperformance of the service is controlled or is subject to the right to control by the master.” \n \nIndependent Contractor \nNot every contract for services necessarily creates a master-servant relationship. There is an important \ndistinction made between the status of a servant and that of an independent contractor. According to \nthe Restatement (Second) of Agency, Section 2, “an independent contractor is a person who contracts \nwith another to do something for him but who is not controlled by the other nor subject to the other’s \nright to control with respect to his physical conduct in the performance of the undertaking.” As the name \nimplies, the independent contractor is legally autonomous. A plumber salaried to a building contractor is \nan employee and agent of the contractor. But a plumber who hires himself out to repair pipes in people’s \nhomes is an independent contractor. If you hire a lawyer to settle a dispute, that person is not your \nemployee or your servant; she is an independent contractor. The terms “agent” and “independent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n377 \ncontractor” are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In fact, by definition, “… an independent contractor is \nan agent in the broad sense of the term in undertaking, at the request of another, to do something for the \nother. As a general rule the line of demarcation between an independent contractor and a servant is not \nclearly drawn.” [1] \n \nThis distinction between agent and independent contractor has important legal consequences for \ntaxation, workers’ compensation, and liability insurance. For example, employers are required to withhold \nincome taxes from their employees’ paychecks. But payment to an independent contractor, such as the \nplumber for hire, does not require such withholding. Deciding who is an independent contractor is not",

It is not uncommon for one \nperson to act as an agent for another without consideration. For example, Abe asks Byron to run some \nerrands for him: to buy some lumber on his account at the local lumberyard. Such a \ngratuitous agency gives rise to no different results than the more common contractual agency. \n \nFormalities \nMost oral agency contracts are legally binding; the law does not require that they be reduced to writing. In \npractice, many agency contracts are written to avoid problems of proof. And there are situations where an \nagency contract must be in writing: (1) if the agreed-on purpose of the agency cannot be fulfilled within \none year or if the agency relationship is to last more than one year; (2) in many states, an agreement to \npay a commission to a real estate broker; (3) in many states, authority given to an agent to sell real estate; \nand (4) in several states, contracts between companies and sales representatives. \n \nEven when the agency contract is not required to be in writing, contracts that agents make with third \nparties often must be in writing. Thus Section 2-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code specifically requires \ncontracts for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more to be in writing and “signed by \nthe party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent.” \n \n \nCapacity \nA contract is void or voidable when one of the parties lacks capacity to make one. If both principal and \nagent lack capacity—for example, a minor appoints another minor to negotiate or sign an agreement—\nthere can be no question of the contract’s voidability. But suppose only one or the other lacks capacity. \nGenerally, the law focuses on the principal. If the principal is a minor or otherwise lacks capacity, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n380 \ncontract can be avoided even if the agent is fully competent.

The agency \nrelationship then is said to have been implied “by operation of law.” Children in most states may purchase \nnecessary items—food or medical services—on the parent’s account. Long-standing social policy deems it \ndesirable for the head of a family to support his dependents, and the courts will put the expense on the \nfamily head in order to provide for the dependents’ welfare. The courts achieve this result by supposing \nthe dependent to be the family head’s agent, thus allowing creditors to sue the family head for the debt. \n \nImplied agencies also arise where one person behaves as an agent would and the “principal,” knowing that \nthe “agent” is behaving so, acquiesces, allowing the person to hold himself out as an agent. Such are the \nbasic facts in Weingart v. Directoire Restaurant, Inc. in Section 9.3.1 \"Creation of Agency: Liability of \nParent for Contracts Made by “Agent” Child\". \n \nApparent Agency \nSuppose Arthur is Paul’s agent, employed through October 31.

Lumber Yard, \nnot knowing that Arthur’s employment terminated the day before, bills Paul. Will Paul have to pay? Yes, \nbecause the termination of the agency was not communicated to Lumber Yard.

Agency imposes a higher duty than simply to abide by the contract terms. It \nimposes a fiduciary duty. The law infiltrates the contract creating the agency relationship and reverses \nthe general principle that the parties are free to act in the absence of agreement. As a fiduciary of the \nprincipal, the agent stands in a position of special trust. His responsibility is to subordinate his self-\ninterest to that of his principal. The fiduciary responsibility is imposed by law. The absence of any clause \nin the contract detailing the agent’s fiduciary duty does not relieve him of it. The duty contains several \naspects. \n \nDuty to Avoid Self-Dealing \nA fiduciary may not lawfully profit from a conflict between his personal interest in a transaction and his \nprincipal’s interest in that same transaction. A broker hired as a purchasing agent, for instance, may not \nsell to his principal through a company in which he or his family has a financial interest.

Such information could \neasily be turned to the disadvantage of the principal if the agent were to compete with the principal or \nwere to sell the information to those who do. The law therefore prohibits an agent from using for his own \npurposes or in ways that would injure the interests of the principal, information confidentially given or \nacquired. This prohibition extends to information gleaned from the principal though unrelated to the \nagent’s assignment: “[A]n agent who is told by the principal of his plans, or who secretly examines books \nor memoranda of the employer, is not privileged to use such information at his principal’s \nexpense.” [1] Nor may the agent use confidential information after resigning his agency.

Section 9.3.3 \"Breach of Fiduciary \nDuty\", Bacon v. Volvo Service Center, Inc., deals with an agent’s breach of the duty of confidentiality. \n \nOther Duties \nIn addition to fiduciary responsibility (and whatever special duties may be contained in the specific \ncontract) the law of agency imposes other duties on an agent. These duties are not necessarily unique to \nagents: a nonfiduciary employee could also be bound to these duties on the right facts. \n \nDuty of Skill and Care \nAn agent is usually taken on because he has special knowledge or skills that the principal wishes to tap. \nThe agent is under a legal duty to perform his work with the care and skill that is “standard in the locality \nfor the kind of work which he is employed to perform” and to exercise any special skills, if these are \ngreater or more refined than those prevalent among those normally employed in the community.

The \nanswer is that there are certain exceptions to the ban: for instance, a worker may sue if the employer \ndeliberately injures an employee. \n \nThe second method of compliance with workers’ compensation laws is to insure through a state fund \nestablished for the purpose. The third method is to self-insure. The laws specify conditions under which \ncompanies may resort to self-insurance, and generally only the largest corporations qualify to do so. In \nshort, workers’ compensation systems create a tax on employers with which they are required (again, in \nmost states) to buy insurance. The amount the employer has to pay for the insurance depends on the \nnumber and seriousness of claims made—how dangerous the work is.

Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected.

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status.

The agent’s personal liability in tort and contract \n5. How agency relationships are terminated \n \n \nIn Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\" we considered the relationships between \nagent and principal. Now we turn to relationships between third parties and the principal or agent. \nWhen the agent makes a contract for his principal or commits a tort in the course of his work, is the \nprincipal liable? What is the responsibility of the agent for torts committed and contracts entered \ninto on behalf of his principal? How may the relationship be terminated so that the principal or agent \nwill no longer have responsibility toward or liability for the acts of the other? These are the questions \naddressed in this chapter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.1 Principal’s Contract Liability \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand that the principal’s liability depends on whether the agent was authorized to make the \ncontract. \n2. Recognize how the agent’s authority is acquired: expressly, impliedly, or apparently. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n417 \n3. Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority",

A million-dollar industrial accident is \nwithin the means of a company or its insurer; it is usually not within the means of the agent—employee—\nwho caused it. \n \nThe “deep pocket” of the defendant-company is not always very deep, however. For many small \nbusinesses, in fact, the principle of respondeat superior is one of life or death. One example was the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n425 \nclosing in San Francisco of the much-beloved Larraburu Brothers Bakery—at the time, the world’s second \nlargest sourdough bread maker. The bakery was held liable for $2 million in damages after one of its \ndelivery trucks injured a six-year-old boy. The bakery’s insurance policy had a limit of $1.25 million, and \nthe bakery could not absorb the excess. The Larraburus had no choice but to cease operations. \n(Seehttp://www.outsidelands.org/larraburu.php.) \n \nRespondeat superior raises three difficult questions: (1) What type of agents can create tort liability for \nthe principal? (2) Is the principal liable for the agent’s intentional torts? (3) Was the agent acting within \nthe scope of his employment? We will consider these questions in turn. \n \n \nAgents for Whom Principals Are Vicariously Liable \nIn general, the broadest liability is imposed on the master in the case of tortious physical conduct by a \nservant, as discussed in Chapter 9 \"Relationships between Principal and Agent\". If the servant acted \nwithin the scope of his employment—that is, if the servant’s wrongful conduct occurred while performing \nhis job—the master will be liable to the victim for damages unless, as we have seen, the victim was another \nemployee, in which event the workers’ compensation system will be invoked. Vicarious tort liability is \nprimarily a function of the employment relationship and not agency status. \n \nOrdinarily, an individual or a company is not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of independent \ncontractors.

The court held the father liable because he \nmade the car available for the pleasure and convenience of his son and other family members. \n \nTorts of Family Members \nAt common law, the husband was liable for the torts of his wife, not because she was considered an agent \nbut because she was considered to be an extension of him. “Husband and wife were only one person in \nlaw,” [3] says Holmes, and any act of the wife was supposed to have been done at the husband’s direction \n(to which Mr. Dickens’s Mr. Bumble responded, in the memorable line, “If the law supposes that, the law \nis a ass—a idiot” [4]).

Understand the agent’s personal liability for contract. \n3. Recognize the ways the agency relationship is terminated. \n \n \nAgent’s Personal Liability for Torts and Contracts \nTort Liability \nThat a principal is held vicariously liable and must pay damages to an injured third person does not \nexcuse the agent who actually committed the tortious acts. A person is always liable for his or her own \ntorts (unless the person is insane, involuntarily intoxicated, or acting under extreme duress). The agent is \npersonally liable for his wrongful acts and must reimburse the principal for any damages the principal was \nforced to pay, as long as the principal did not authorize the wrongful conduct. The agent directed to \ncommit a tort remains liable for his own conduct but is not obliged to repay the principal. Liability as an \nagent can be burdensome, sometimes perhaps more burdensome than as a principal. The latter normally \npurchases insurance to cover against wrongful acts of agents, but liability insurance policies frequently do \nnot cover the employee’s personal liability if the employee is named in a lawsuit individually. Thus \ndoctors’ and hospitals’ malpractice policies protect a doctor from both her own mistakes and those of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n432 \nnurses and others that the doctor would be responsible for; nurses, however, might need their own \ncoverage. In the absence of insurance, an agent is at serious risk in this lawsuit-conscious age. The risk is \nnot total. The agent is not liable for torts of other agents unless he is personally at fault—for example, by \nnegligently supervising a junior or by giving faulty instructions. For example, an agent, the general \nmanager for a principal, hires Brown as a subordinate. Brown is competent to do the job but by failing to \nexercise proper control over a machine negligently injures Ted, a visitor to the premises. The principal \nand Brown are liable to Ted, but the agent is not. \n \nContract Liability \nIt makes sense that an agent should be liable for her own torts; it would be a bad social policy indeed if a \nperson could escape tort liability based on her own fault merely because she acted in an agency capacity.

No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. We consider each situation. \n \nAgent for Undisclosed or Partially Disclosed Principal \nAn agent need not, and frequently will not, inform the person with whom he is negotiating that he is \nacting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost. If the landowners realized that a major building project was about to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n433 \nlaunched, their asking price would be quite high. So the developer obtains two options to purchase land by \nusing two secret agents—Betty and Clem. \n \nBetty does not mention to sellers that she is an agent; therefore, to those sellers the developer is an \nundisclosed principal. Clem tells those with whom he is dealing that he is an agent but refuses to divulge \nthe developer’s name or his business interest in the land. Thus the developer is, to the latter sellers, a",

Three months after the trial, Judge Parker set aside the verdict and \nrendered judgment for both defendants notwithstanding the verdict.

This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability.

And note again that if the parties do \nnot provide for these in their agreement, RUPA will do it for them as the default. \n \nWho Can Be a Partner? \nAs discussed earlier in this chapter, a partnership is not limited to a direct association between human \nbeings but may also include an association between other entities, such as corporations or even \npartnerships themselves. [1] Family members can be partners, and partnerships between parents and \nminor children are lawful, although a partner who is a minor may disaffirm the agreement. \n \nWritten versus Oral Agreements \nIf the business cannot be performed within one year from the time that the agreement is entered into, the \npartnership agreement should be in writing to avoid invalidation under the Statute of Frauds. Most \npartnerships have no fixed term, however, and are partnerships “at will” and therefore not covered by the \nStatute of Frauds. \n \nValidity of the Partnership Name \nAble, Baker, and Carr decide that it makes good business sense to choose an imposing, catchy, and well-\nknown name for their dealership—General Motors Corporation. There are two reasons why they cannot \ndo so. First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit.

Employment Security Commission), a number of tests have \nbeen established that are clues to the existence of a partnership (see Figure 11.1 \"Partnership Tests\"). We \nreturn to the definition of a partnership: “the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \na business for profit[.]” The three elements are (1) the association of persons, (2) as co-owners, (3) for \nprofit. \n \nAssociation of Persons \nThis element is pretty obvious. A partnership is a contractual agreement among persons, so the persons \ninvolved need to have capacity to contract. But RUPA does not provide that only natural persons can be \npartners; it defines person as follows: “‘Person’ means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, \ntrust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or \ninstrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.” [3] Thus unless state law precludes it, a \ncorporation can be a partner in a partnership. The same is true under UPA. \n \nCo-owners of a Business \nIf what two or more people own is clearly a business—including capital assets, contracts with employees \nor agents, an income stream, and debts incurred on behalf of the operation—a partnership exists. A \ntougher question arises when two or more persons co-own property. Do they automatically become \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n468 \npartners? The answer can be important: if one of the owners while doing business pertinent to the \nproperty injures a stranger, the latter could sue the other owners if there is a partnership. \n \nCo-ownership comes in many guises. The four most common are joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \ntenancy by the entireties, and community property. In joint tenancy, the owners hold the property under a \nsingle instrument, such as a deed, and if one dies, the others automatically become owners of the \ndeceased’s share, which does not descend to his heirs. Tenancy in common has the reverse rule: the \nsurvivor tenants do not take the deceased’s share. Each tenant in common has a distinct estate in the \nproperty. The tenancy by the entirety and community property (in community-property states) forms of \nownership are limited to spouses, and their effects are similar to that of joint tenancy. \n \nSuppose a husband and wife who own their home as tenants by the entirety (or community property)",

Several factors become important in the partnership agreement, \nwhether written or oral. These include the name of the business, the capital contributions of each partner, \nprofit sharing, and decision making. But a partnership can also arise by implication or by estoppel, where one \nhas held herself as a partner and another has relied on that representation. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Chaiken, complainant, hereinafter referred to as Chaiken, for not filing his \nunemployment security assessment report. Pursuant to the same statutory section, a hearing was held \nand a determination made by the Commission that Chaiken was the employer of two barbers in his barber \nshop and that he should be assessed as an employer for his share of unemployment compensation \ncontributions. Chaiken appealed the Commission’s decision.… \n \nBoth in the administrative hearing and in his appeal brief Chaiken argues that he had entered into \npartnership agreements with each of his barbers and, therefore, was and is not subject to unemployment \ncompensation assessment. The burden is upon the individual assessed to show that he is outside the \nambit of the statutory sections requiring assessment. If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important.

Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept.

But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found.

That \nis, the cows were not Shanahan’s; they were the partnership’s. When Whitehead moved to dismiss \nShanahan’s claim—again, because the cows weren’t Shanahan’s—Shanahan conceded that but for the \nexistence of the partnership he would have no claim against Whitehead.

The latter has been adopted by thirty-five states. At common law, a partnership was not a legal entity \nand could not sue or be sued in the partnership name. Partnership law defines a partnership as “an \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit.” The Uniform \nPartnership Act (UPA) assumes that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals, but it also applies a \nnumber of rules characteristic of the legal entity theory. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \nassumes a partnership is an entity, but it applies one crucial rule characteristic of the aggregate theory: \nthe partners are ultimately liable for the partnership’s obligations. Thus a partnership may keep business \nrecords as if it were a legal entity, may hold real estate in the partnership name, and may sue and be sued \nin federal court and in many state courts in the partnership name. \n \nPartnerships may be created informally. Among the clues to the existence of a partnership are (1) co-\nownership of a business, (2) sharing of profits, (3) right to participate in decision making, (4) duty to \nshare liabilities, and (5) manner in which the business is operated. A partnership may also be formed by \nimplication; it may be formed by estoppel when a third party reasonably relies on a representation that a \npartnership in fact exists. \nNo special rules govern the partnership agreement. As a practical matter, it should sufficiently spell out \nwho the partners are, under what name they will conduct their business, the nature and scope of the \nbusiness, capital contributions of each partner, how profits are to be divided, and similar pertinent \nprovisions. An oral agreement to form a partnership is valid unless the business cannot be performed \nwholly within one year from the time that the agreement is made. However, most partnerships have no \nfixed terms and hence are “at-will” partnerships not subject to the Statute of Frauds. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n488",

The Havana Club operated in Salt Lake City under a lease running to defendant Dale Bowen, who owned \nthe equipment, furnishings, and inventory. He did not himself work in operating the club. He made an oral \nagreement with Frances Cutler, who had been working for him as a bartender, that she take over the \nmanagement of the club. She was to have the authority and the responsibility for the entire active \nmanagement and operation: to purchase the supplies, pay the bills, keep the books, hire and fire \nemployees, and do whatever else was necessary to run the business. As compensation, the arrangement \nwas for a down-the-middle split; each was to receive $300 per week plus one half of the net profits. This \nwent on for four years until the city took over the building for a redevelopment project. The city offered \nBowen $30,000 as compensation for loss of business while a new location was found for the club. Failing to \nfind a suitable location, the parties decided to terminate the business. Bowen then contended he was \nentitled to the entire $30,000 as the owner, Cutler being an employee only. She sued to recover half as a \npartner. What was the result? Decide and discuss. \n3.

[1] The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) and the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) \ndo not dictate what the relations among partners must be; the acts supply rules in the event that the \npartners have not done so for themselves. In this area, it is especially important for the partners to \nelaborate their agreement in writing. If the partners should happen to continue their business beyond the \nterm fixed for it in their agreement, the terms of the agreement continue to apply. \n \nDuties Partners Owe Each Other \nAmong the duties partners owe each other, six may be called out here: (1) the duty to serve, (2) the duty of \nloyalty, (3) the duty of care, (4) the duty of obedience, (5) the duty to inform copartners, and (6) the duty \nto account to the partnership. These are all very similar to the duty owed by an agent to the principal, as \npartnership law is based on agency concepts.

For example, suppose Joan takes her two-week vacation from the horse-stable \npartnership she operates with Sarah and Sandra.

So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of \nother partners’ successes (and pay for their failures too).

But partnership \nproperty consists of all property originally advanced or contributed to the partnership or subsequently \nacquired by purchase or contribution.

This means that without demand—and for any purpose—the \npartnership must provide any information concerning its business and affairs reasonably required for the \nproper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or the act; and on \ndemand, it must provide any other information concerning the partnership’s business and affairs, unless \nthe demand is unreasonable or improper.

If a partner profits in violation of his fiduciary duty (as per UPA 22); and \n4. Whenever it is otherwise just and reasonable. \n \nAt common law, partners could not obtain an accounting except in the event of dissolution. But from an \nearly date, equity courts would appoint a referee, auditor, or special master to investigate the books of a \nbusiness when one of the partners had grounds to complain, and UPA broadened considerably the right to \nan accounting. The court has plenary power to investigate all facets of the business, evaluate claims, \ndeclare legal rights among the parties, and order money judgments against any partner in the wrong. \n \nUnder RUPA Section 405, this “accounting” business is somewhat modified. Reflecting the entity theory, \nthe partnership can sue a partner for wrongdoing, which is not allowed under UPA. Moreover, to quote \nfrom the Official Comment, RUPA “provides that, during the term of the partnership, partners may \nmaintain a variety of legal or equitable actions, including an action for an accounting, as well as a final \naction for an accounting upon dissolution and winding up. It reflects a new policy choice that partners \nshould have access to the courts during the term of the partnership to resolve claims against the \npartnership and the other partners, leaving broad judicial discretion to fashion appropriate remedies[, \nand] an accounting is not a prerequisite to the availability of the other remedies a partner may have \nagainst the partnership or the other partners.” [20] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n503 \nKEY TAKEAWAY",

The bad thing about the partnership as a form of business organization is that it imposes \nliability on the partners personally and without limit. Section 306 of RUPA provides that “all partners are \nliable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or \nprovided by law.” [5] Section 13 of UPA is in accord. \n \nLiability of Existing Partners \nContract liability is joint and several: that is, all partners are liable (“joint”) and each is “several.” (We \nusually do not use several in modern English to mean “each”; it’s an archaic usage.) But—and here’s the \nintrusion of entity theory—generally RUPA requires the judgment creditor to exhaust the partnership’s \nassets before going after the separate assets of a partner.

Sections 17 and 41(7) of UPA are in accord. But, again, under either statute a new \npartner’s personal assets are at risk with respect to partnership liabilities incurred after her admission as a \npartner. This is a daunting prospect, and it is the reason for the invention of hybrid forms of business \norganization: limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and limited liability partnerships. The \ncorporate form, of course, also (usually) obviates the owners’ personal liability. \n \nTort and Criminal Liability \nPartnership Liability for Torts \nThe rules affecting partners’ tort liability (discussed in Section 12.2.1 \"Contract Liability\") and those \naffecting contract liability are the same. Section 13 of UPA says the partnership is liable for “any wrongful \nact or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership or with the \nauthority of his co-partners.” [7]A civil “wrongful act” is necessarily either a tort or a breach of contract, so \nno distinction is made between them. (Section 305 of RUPA changed the phraseology slightly by adding \nafter any wrongful act or omission the words or other actionable conduct; this makes the partnership \nliable for its partner’s no-fault torts.) That the principal should be liable for its agents’ wrongdoings is of \ncourse basic agency law. RUPA does expand liability by allowing a partner to sue during the term of the \npartnership without first having to get out of it, as is required under UPA. \n \nFor tortious acts, the partners are said to be jointly and severally liable under both UPA and RUPA, and \nthe plaintiff may separately sue one or more partners.

Explain the winding up of partnerships under UPA and RUPA. \n \n \nIt is said that a partnership is like a marriage, and that extends to its ending too. It’s easier to get into a \npartnership than it is to get out of it because legal entanglements continue after a person is no longer a \npartner. The rules governing “getting out” of a partnership are different under the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) than under the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). We take up UPA first. \n \nDissolution of Partnerships under UPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n512 \nDissolution, in the most general sense, means a separation into component parts. \n \nMeaning of Dissolution under UPA \nPeople in business are sometimes confused about the meaning of dissolution. It does not mean the \ntermination of a business. It has a precise legal definition, given in UPA Section 29: “The dissolution of a \npartnership is the change in the relation of the partners caused by any partner ceasing to be associated in \nthe carrying on as distinguished from the winding up of the business.” The partnership is not necessarily \nterminated on dissolution; rather, it continues until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed, \nand the remaining partners may choose to continue on as a new partnership if they want. [1] But, again, \nunder UPA the partnership dissolves upon the withdrawal of any partner. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nPartnerships can dissolve for a number of reasons. [2] \n \nIn Accordance with the Agreement \nThe term of the partnership agreement may have expired or the partnership may be at will and one of the \npartners desires to leave it.

Assume that when Baker left, the business owed Mogul Parts Company \n$5,000 and Laid Back Upholsterers $4,000. After Baker left and Alice joined, Mogul sells another $5,000 \nworth of parts to the firm on credit, and Sizzling Radiator Repair, a new creditor, advances $3,000 worth \nof radiator repair parts.

Both general and \nlimited partners benefit from a full, status-based liability shield that is equivalent to the shield enjoyed by \ncorporate shareholders, LLC members, and partners in an LLP.” \n \nPresumably, most existing limited partnerships will switch over to LLLPs.

Many government \nprograms reflect peoples’ interest in adverting risk: federal deposit insurance, Social Security, and \nbankruptcy, to name three.

The partnership form imposes serious potential risk: \nunlimited personal liability. The corporate form eliminates that risk but imposes some onerous formalities and \ndouble taxation. Early on, then, the limited partnership form was born, but it still imposed unlimited liability \non the general partner and on the limited partner if she became too actively involved. Congress was induced \nin the mid-1950s to allow certain small US corporations the right to single taxation, but the sub-S corporation \nstill suffered from various limitations on its structure. In the 1980s, the limited liability company was invented; \nit has become the entity of choice for many businesspeople, but its availability for professionals was limited. \nIn the late 1980s, the limited liability partnership form gained favor, and in the early 2000s, the limited liability \nlimited partnership finished off unlimited liability for limited partnerships. \n \nEXERCISES",

Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws. The early general laws had imposed \nnumerous restrictions. The breadth of corporate enterprise was limited, ceilings were placed on total \ncapital and indebtedness, incorporators were required to have residence in the state, the duration of the \ncompany often was not perpetual but was limited to a term of years or until a particular undertaking was \ncompleted, and the powers of management were circumscribed. These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589",

The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England.

By contrast, \nownership and control of corporations are, in theory, separated. In the publicly held corporation, \nwhich has many shareholders, the separation is real. Ownership is widely dispersed because millions of \nshares are outstanding and it is rare that any single shareholder will own more than a tiny percentage of \nstock. It is difficult under the best of circumstances for shareholders to exert any form of control over \ncorporate operations. However, in the closely held corporation, which has few shareholders, the \nofficers or senior managers are usually also the shareholders, so the separation of ownership and control \nmay be less pronounced or even nonexistent. \n \nTransferability of Interests \nTransferability of an interest in a partnership is a problem because a transferee cannot become a member \nunless all partners consent. The problem can be addressed and overcome in the partnership \nagreement.

Its president, one of the company’s largest creditors and \nalso virtually its sole owner, instigated the fire. The corporation sued the insurance company to recover \nthe amount for which it was insured. According to the court in the Felsenthal case, “The general rule of \nlaw is that the willful burning of property by a stockholder in a corporation is not a defense against the \ncollection of the insurance by the corporation, and…the corporation cannot be prevented from collecting \nthe insurance because its agents willfully set fire to the property without the participation or authority of \nthe corporation or of all of the stockholders of the corporation.” [3] But because the fire was caused by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n596 \nbeneficial owner of “practically all” the stock, who also “has the absolute management of [the \ncorporation’s] affairs and its property, and is its president,” the court refused to allow the company to \nrecover the insurance money; allowing the company to recover would reward fraud. [4] \n \nFailure to Act as a Corporation \nIn other limited circumstances, individual stockholders may also be found personally liable. Failure to \nfollow corporate formalities, for example, may subject stockholders to personal liability. This is a \nspecial risk that small, especially one-person, corporations run. Particular factors that bring this rule into \nplay include inadequate capitalization, omission of regular meetings, failure to record minutes of \nmeetings, failure to file annual reports, and commingling of corporate and personal assets. Where these \nfactors exist, the courts may look through the corporate veil and pluck out the individual stockholder or \nstockholders to answer for a tort, contract breach, or the like. The classic case is the taxicab operator who \nincorporates several of his cabs separately and services them through still another corporation. If one of \nthe cabs causes an accident, the corporation is usually “judgment proof” because the corporation will have \nfew assets (practically worthless cab, minimum insurance).

The term used for the \ndocument varies from state to state. Most states call the basic document filed in the appropriate public \noffice the “articles of incorporation” or “certificate of incorporation,” but there are other variations. There \nis no legal significance to these differences in terminology. \n \nChartering is basically a state prerogative. Congress has chartered several enterprises, including national \nbanks (under the National Banking Act), federal savings and loan associations, national farm loan \nassociations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted.

In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work. Promoters are the individuals who take the steps necessary to form the \ncorporation, and they often will receive stock in exchange for their efforts. They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated. Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed.

Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers.

For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nIn sustaining a state criminal statute that forbids certain expenditures by banks and business corporations \nfor the purpose of influencing the vote on referendum proposals, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial \nCourt held that the First Amendment rights of a corporation are limited to issues that materially affect its \nbusiness, property, or assets. The court rejected appellants’ claim that the statute abridges freedom of \nspeech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The issue presented in this context is one of \nfirst impression in this Court. We postponed the question of jurisdiction to our consideration of the \nmerits. We now reverse. \n \nThe statute at issue, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., Ch. 55, § 8 (West Supp. 1977), prohibits appellants, two \nnational banking associations and three business corporations, from making contributions or \nexpenditures “for the purpose of…influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the \nvoters, other than one materially affecting any of the property, business or assets of the corporation.” The \nstatute further specifies that “[no] question submitted to the voters solely concerning the taxation of the \nincome, property or transactions of individuals shall be deemed materially to affect the property, business \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n612",

We believe that the court posed the wrong question. The Constitution often \nprotects interests broader than those of the party seeking their vindication.

The “materially affecting” requirement is not an identification \nof the boundaries of corporate speech etched by the Constitution itself.

(Ott II), for the costs of cleaning up industrial \nwaste generated by Ott II’s chemical plant. Section 107(a)(2) authorizes suits against, among others, “any \nperson who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.” The trial \nfocused on whether CPC, as a parent corporation, had “owned or operated” Ott II’s plant within the \nmeaning of §107(a)(2). The District Court said that operator liability may attach to a parent corporation \nboth indirectly, when the corporate veil can be pierced under state law, and directly, when the parent has \nexerted power or influence over its subsidiary by actively participating in, and exercising control over, the \nsubsidiary’s business during a period of hazardous waste disposal.

Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business.

Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting.

This can be done through loans or bank financing but is \noften accomplished through the sale of bonds. Large corporations, in particular, use the bond market. \nPrivate equity is not ideal for established firms because of the high cost to them, both monetarily and in \nterms of the potential loss of control. \n \nFor financing, many corporations sell corporate bonds to investors. A bond is like an IOU. When a \ncorporation sells a bond, it owes the bond purchaser periodic interest payments as well as a lump sum at \nthe end of the life of the bond (the maturity date). A typical bond is issued with a face value, also called the \npar value, of $1,000 or some multiple of $1,000. The face value is the amount that the corporation must \npay the purchaser at the end of the life of the bond. Interest payments, also called coupon payments, \nare usually made on a biannual basis but could be of nearly any duration.

There are even zero coupon \nbonds, which pay only the face value at maturity. \n \nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Bonds \nOne advantage of issuing bonds is that the corporation does not give away ownership interests. When a \ncorporation sells stock, it changes the ownership interest in the firm, but bonds do not alter the ownership \nstructure. Bonds provide flexibility for a corporation: it can issue bonds of varying durations, value, \npayment terms, convertibility, and so on. Bonds also expand the number of investors available to the \ncorporation. From an investor standpoint, bonds are generally less risky than stock. Most corporate bonds \nare given ratings—a measurement of the risk associated with holding a particular bond. Therefore, risk-\naverse investors who would not purchase a corporation’s stock could seek lower-risk returns in highly \nrated corporate bonds. Investors are also drawn to bonds because the bond market is much larger than \nthe stock market and bonds are highly liquid and less risky than many other types of investments. \n \nAnother advantage to the corporation is the ability to make bonds “callable”—the corporation can force \nthe investor to sell bonds back to the corporation before the maturity date. Often, there is an additional \ncost to the corporation (a call premium) that must be paid to the bondholder, but the call provision \nprovides another level of flexibility for the corporation. Bonds may also be convertible; the corporation \ncan include a provision that permits bondholders to convert their bonds into equity shares in the firm. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n635 \nThis would permit the corporation to decrease the cost of the bonds, because bondholders would \nordinarily accept lower coupon payments in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into equity. \nPerhaps the most important advantage to issuing bonds is from a taxation standpoint: the interest \npayments made to the bondholders may be deductible from the corporation’s taxes. \n \nA key disadvantage of bonds is that they are debt. The corporation must make its bond interest payments. \nIf a corporation cannot make its interest payments, the bondholders can force it into bankruptcy.

Article 8 can be viewed \nathttp://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8/overview.html. \n \nThe UCC and the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts \nThe Securities Act of 1933 requires the registration of securities that are sold or offered to be sold using \ninterstate commerce. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs the secondary trading of securities, \nsuch as stock market sales. The UCC also governs securities, through Articles 8 and 9. The key difference \nis that the 1933 and 1934 acts are federal law, while the UCC operates at the state level. The UCC was \nestablished to standardize state laws governing sales and commercial transactions. There are some \nsubstantial differences, however, between the two acts and the UCC. Without going into exhaustive detail, \nit is important to note a few of them. For one, the definition of security in the UCC is different from the \ndefinition in the 1933 and 1934 acts. Thus a security may be governed by the securities acts but not by the \nUCC. The definition of a private placement of securities also differs between the UCC and the securities \nacts. Other differences exist. [2] The UCC, as well as state-specific laws, and the federal securities laws \nshould all be considered in financial transactions. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe RMBCA advises doing away with financial concepts such as stock par value.

Given \nthis division of power, certain duties are owed amongst the parties. We focus this chapter upon these \npowers and upon the duties owed by shareholders, directors, and officers. In Chapter 17 \"Securities \nRegulation\", we will continue discussion of officers’ and directors’ liability within the context of \nsecurities regulation and insider trading. \n \n \n \n16.1 Powers of a Corporation \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Understand the two types of corporate power. \n2. Consider the ramifications when a corporation acts outside its prescribed powers. \n3. Review legal issues surrounding corporate actions. \n \n \n \nTwo Types of Corporate Powers \nA corporation generally has three parties sharing power and control: directors, officers, and shareholders. \nDirectors are the managers of the corporation, and officers control the day-to-day decisions and work \nmore closely with the employees. The shareholders are the owners of the corporation, but they have little \ndecision-making authority. The corporation itself has powers; while a corporation is not the same as a \nperson (e.g., a corporation cannot be put in prison), it is allowed to conduct certain activities and has been \ngranted certain rights. \n \nExpress Powers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n668 \nThe corporation may exercise all powers expressly given it by statute and by its articles of incorporation. \nSection 3.02 of the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) sets out a number \nof express powers, including the following: to sue and be sued in the corporate name; to purchase, use, \nand sell land and dispose of assets to the same extent a natural person can; to make contracts, borrow",

Illegal acts of its agents may be \nimputed to the corporation. Thus if the board of directors specifically authorizes the company to carry out \na criminal scheme, or the president instructs his employees to break a regulatory law for the benefit of the \ncompany, the corporation itself may be convicted. Of course, it is rare for people in a corporate setting to \navow their criminal intentions, so in most cases courts determine the corporation’s liability by deciding \nwhether an employee’s crime was part of a job-related activity. The individuals within the corporation are \nmuch more likely to be held legally liable, but the corporation may be as well. For example, in extreme \ncases, a court could order the dissolution of the corporation; revoke some or all of its ability to operate, \nsuch as by revoking a license the corporation may hold; or prevent the corporation from engaging in a \ncritical aspect of its business, such as acting as a trustee or engaging in securities transactions. But these \ncases are extremely rare. \n \nThat a corporation is found guilty of a violation of the law does not excuse company officials who \nauthorized or carried out the illegal act. They, too, can be prosecuted and sent to jail.

The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Department of Justice, other regulatory bodies, and legal professionals have increasingly sought legal \npenalties against both corporations and its employees. See Exercise 2 at the end of this section to consider \nthe legal ramifications of a corporation and its employees for the drunk-driving death of one of its \npatrons. \n \nIn certain cases, the liability of an executive can be vicarious. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction \nof a chief executive who had no personal knowledge of a violation by his company of regulations \npromulgated by the Food and Drug Administration. In this case, an officer was held strictly liable for his \ncorporation’s violation of the regulations, regardless of his knowledge, or lack thereof, of the actions \n(see Chapter 6 \"Criminal Law\"). [4] This stands in contrast to the general rule that an individual must \nknow, or should know, of a violation of the law in order to be liable. Strict liability does not require \nknowledge. Thus a corporation’s top managers can be found criminally responsible even if they did not \ndirectly participate in the illegal activity.

Section 8.01 of the Revised \nModel Business Corporation Act (RMBCA) states that “all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under \nthe authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, its board \nof directors.” A director is a fiduciary, a person to whom power is entrusted for another’s benefit, and as \nsuch, as the RMBCA puts it, must perform his duties “in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent \nperson in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances” (Section 8.30). A director’s main \nresponsibilities include the following: (1) to protect shareholder investments, (2) to select and remove \nofficers, (3) to delegate operating authority to the managers or other groups, and (4) to supervise the \ncompany as a whole. \n \n \n \nDelegation to Committees \nUnder RMBCA Section 8.25, the board of directors, by majority vote, may delegate its powers to various \ncommittees. This authority is limited to some degree. For example, only the full board can determine \ndividends, approve a merger, and amend the bylaws. The delegation of authority to a committee does not, \nby itself, relieve a director from the duty to exercise due care. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n681 \nDelegation to Officers \n \nFigure 16.2 The Corporate Governance Model \n \n \nThe directors often delegate to officers the day-to-day authority to execute the policies established by the \nboard and to manage the firm (see Figure 16.2 \"The Corporate Governance Model\").

The initial members of the board hold office \nuntil the first annual meeting, when elections occur. (The initial board members are permitted to succeed \nthemselves.) Directors are often chosen to serve one-year terms and must be elected or reelected by the \nshareholders annually, unless there are nine or more directors.

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club.

On three different occasions, the plaintiff submitted applications for membership on behalf of a \ndifferent female, and only on the third of those occasions did the board process the application, which it \nthen rejected.

Sixty-nine private damage actions were subsequently filed against TGS by \nshareholders who claimed they sold their stock in reliance on the release. The company settled most of \nthese suits in late 1971 for $2.7 million. \n \nFollowing the TGS episode, the Supreme Court refined Rule 10b-5 on several fronts. First, in Ernst & \nErnst v. Hochfelder, [3] the Court decided that proof of scienter—defined as “mental state embracing \nintent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”—is required in private damage actions under Rule 10b-5. In \nother words, negligence alone will not result in Rule 10b-5 liability. The Court also held that scienter, \nwhich is an intentional act, must be established in SEC injunctive actions.

Levinson (see Section 17.3.3 \"Duty to \nDisclose Material Information\"). This case is also important in its discussion of the degree of reliance \ninvestors must prove to support a Rule 10b-5 action. \nIn 2000, the SEC enacted Rule 10b5-1, which defines trading “on the basis of” inside information as any \ntime a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. Therefore, a defendant is not saved \nby arguing that the trade was made independent of knowledge of the nonpublic information. However, \nthe rule also creates an affirmative defense for trades that were planned prior to the person’s receiving \ninside information. \n \nIn addition to its decisions relating to intent (Ernst & Ernst), tippees (Dirks), materiality (Basic), and \nawareness of nonpublic information (10b5-1), the Supreme Court has considered \nthe misappropriation theory, under which a person who misappropriates information from an \nemployer faces insider trading liability. In a leading misappropriation theory case, the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals reinstated an indictment against employees who traded on the basis of inside \ninformation obtained through their work at investment banking firms. The court concluded that the \nemployees’ violation of their fiduciary duty to the firms violated securities law. [6] The US Supreme Court \nupheld the misappropriation theory in United States v.

We conclude that they are. \n \nThe Co-Op is an agricultural cooperative that, at the same time relevant here, had approximately 23,000 \nmembers. In order to raise money to support its general business operations, the Co-Op sold promissory \nnotes payable on demand by the holder. Although the notes were uncollateralized and uninsured, they \npaid a variable rate of interest that was adjusted monthly to keep it higher than the rate paid by local \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n733 \nfinancial institutions. The Co-Op offered the notes to both members and nonmembers, marketing the \nscheme as an “Investment Program.” Advertisements for the notes, which appeared in each Co-Op \nnewsletter, read in part: “YOUR CO-OP has more than $11,000,000 in assets to stand behind your \ninvestments. The Investment is not Federal [sic] insured but it is…Safe…Secure…and available when you \nneed it.” App. 5 (ellipses in original). Despite these assurances, the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy in 1984. At \nthe time of the filing, over 1,600 people held notes worth a total of $10 million. \nAfter the Co-Op filed for bankruptcy, petitioners, a class of holders of the notes, filed suit against Arthur \nYoung & Co., the firm that had audited the Co-Op’s financial statements (and the predecessor to \nrespondent Ernst & Young). Petitioners alleged, inter alia, that Arthur Young had intentionally failed to \nfollow generally accepted accounting principles in its audit, specifically with respect to the valuation of \none of the Co-Op’s major assets, a gasohol plant. Petitioners claimed that Arthur Young violated these",

There was no expectation by Dirk’s \nsources that he would keep their information in confidence. Nor did Dirks misappropriate or illegally \nobtain the information about Equity Funding.

We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC.",

After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC. \n \nThere are several advantages to an asset purchase, most notably, that the acquiring corporation can pick \nwhat assets and liabilities (with certain limitations, discussed further on in this section) it wishes to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n747 \nacquire. Furthermore, certain transactions may avoid a shareholder vote. If the selling corporation does \nnot sell substantially all of its assets, then its shareholders may not get a vote to approve the sale. \n \nFor example, after several years of successful merchandising, a corporation formed by Bob, Carol, and Ted \n(BCT Bookstore, Inc.) has opened three branch stores around town and discovered its transportation \ncosts mounting. Inventory arrives in trucks operated by the Flying Truckman Co., Inc. The BCT \ncorporation concludes that the economics of delivery do not warrant purchasing a single truck dedicated \nto hauling books for its four stores alone. Then Bob learns that the owners of Flying Truckman might be \nwilling to part with their company because it has not been earning money lately. If BCT could reorganize \nFlying Truckman’s other routes, it could reduce its own shipping costs while making a profit on other lines \nof business. \n \nUnder the circumstances, the simplest and safest way to acquire Flying Truckman is by purchasing its \nassets. That way BCT would own the trucks and whatever routes it chooses, without taking upon itself the \nstigma of the association. It could drop the name Flying Truckman. \n \nIn most states, the board of directors of both the seller and the buyer must approve a transfer of assets. \nShareholders of the selling corporation must also consent by majority vote, but shareholders of the \nacquiring company need not be consulted, so Ted’s opposition can be effectively mooted; see Figure 18.1 \n\"Purchase of Assets\". (When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such.

The \nacquiring company also assumes all debts of the acquired company. \n \nA merger begins when two or more corporations negotiate an agreement outlining the specifics of a \nmerger, such as which corporation survives and the identities of management personnel. There are two \nmain types of merger: a cash merger and a noncash merger. In a cash merger, the shareholders of the \ndisappearing corporation surrender their shares for cash. These shareholders retain no interest in the \nsurviving corporation, having been bought out. This is often called a freeze-out merger, since the \nshareholders of the disappearing corporation are frozen out of an interest in the surviving corporation. \n \nIn a noncash merger, the shareholders of the disappearing corporation retain an interest in the surviving \ncorporation. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade their shares for shares in the \nsurviving corporation; thus they retain an interest in the surviving corporation when they become \nshareholders of that surviving corporation. \n \nUnless the articles of incorporation state otherwise, majority approval of the merger by both boards of \ndirectors and both sets of shareholders is necessary (see Figure 18.2 \"Merger\").

As with mergers, the boards and shareholders must approve the consolidation by \nmajority votes (see Figure 18.3 \"Consolidation\"). The resulting corporation becomes effective when the \nsecretary of state issues a certificate of merger or incorporation. \n \nFigure 18.3Consolidation \n \n \nFor more information on mergers and consolidation under Delaware law, see Del.

The first involves the purchase of assets not in the \nordinary course of business. Using this method, the purchase expands the corporation. The second and third \nmethods, merger and consolidation, are very similar: two or more corporations combine. In a merger, one of \nthe merging companies survives, and the other ceases to exist. In a consolidation, the merging corporations \ncease to exist when they combine to form a new corporation. The final method is a stock purchase, \naccomplished via a tender offer, takeover, or leveraged buyout.

Discuss state-imposed conditions on the admission of foreign corporations. \n2. Discuss state court jurisdiction over foreign corporations. \n3. Explain how states may tax foreign corporations. \n4. Apply the US Constitution to foreign corporations. \n \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside the state in which it is doing business. A \nDelaware corporation, operating in all states, is a foreign corporation in forty-nine of them. \n \nConditions on Admission to Do Business \nStates can impose on foreign corporations conditions on admission to do business if certain constitutional \nbarriers are surmounted. One potential problem is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, \nSection 2, of the Constitution, which provides that “citizens shall be entitled to all privileges and \nimmunities of citizens in the several states.” The Supreme Court has interpreted this murky language to \nmean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. For example, \nthe Court voided a tax New Hampshire imposed on out-of-state commuters on the grounds that “the tax \nfalls exclusively on the incomes of nonresidents.” [1] However, corporations are uniformly held not to be \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n756 \ncitizens for purposes of this clause, so the states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do \nnot put upon companies incorporated under their laws. But these burdens may only be imposed on \ncompanies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state. \n \nOther constitutional rights of the corporation or its members may also come into play when states attempt \nto license foreign corporations. Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts.

These conditions may include requirements such as obtaining a license, paying taxes, and complying with state laws. However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution to mean that states may not discriminate between their own citizens and those of other states. Therefore, states may impose burdens on foreign corporations that they do not put upon companies incorporated under their laws, but these burdens may only be imposed on companies that conduct intrastate business, having some level of business transactions within that state."

It is easy to see why. When you deposit cash in a checking account, you may either \nwithdraw the currency—coins and bills—or draw on the account by writing out a check. If you write a \ncheck to “cash,” withdraw currency, and pay a creditor, there has been no change in the money supply. \nBut if you pay your creditor by check, the quantity of money has increased: the cash you deposited \nremains available, and your creditor deposits the check to his own account as though it were cash.

For example, the note can state that the principal is $1,000 and the \ninterest is 11.5 percent, without specifying the total amount. Or the note could state the amount in \ninstallments: twelve equal installments of $88.25. Or it could state different interest rates before and after \na certain date or depending on whether or not the maker has defaulted; it could be determinable by a \nformula or by reference to a source described in the instrument. [2] It could permit the maker to take a \ndiscount if he pays before a certain date or could assess a penalty if he pays after the date. It could also \nprovide for an attorney’s fees and the costs of collection on default. If it is clear that interest is to be \nincluded but no interest amount is set, UCC Section 3-112 provides that it is “payable at the judgment rate \nin effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.” The fundamental \nrule is that for any time of payment, the holder must be able to determine, after the appropriate \ncalculations, the amount then payable. See Section 19.4 \"Cases\", Centerre Bank of Branson v. Campbell, \nfor a case involving the “fixed amount” rule. \n \nIn Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which \nthe instrument is paid.” \n \nPayable on Demand or at a Definite Time \nAn instrument that says it is payable on sight is payable on demand, as is one that states no time for",

A blank indorsement converts the instrument into paper closely akin to cash. Since \nthe indorsement does not specify to whom the instrument is to be paid, it is treated like bearer paper—\nassuming, of course, that the first indorser is the person to whom the instrument was payable originally. A \npaper with blank indorsement may be negotiated by delivery alone, until such time as a holder converts it \ninto aspecial indorsement (discussed next) by writing over the signature any terms consistent with the \nindorsement. For example, a check indorsed by the payee (signed on the back) may be passed from one \nperson to another and cashed in by any of them. \n \nFigure 20.4 Forms of Endorsement \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n820 \nA blank indorsement creates conditional contract liability in the indorser: he is liable to pay if the paper is \ndishonored.

Once specially \nindorsed, the check (or other instrument) can be negotiated further only when the special indorsee adds \nhis own signature. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing above \nthe signature of the indorser words of a contractual nature consistent with the character of the \ninstrument. \n \nSo, for example, Lorna Love’s check to Rackets, Inc., indorsed in blank (signed by its agent or stamped \nwith Rackets’ indorsement stamp—its name alone) and handed to City Water, is not very safe: it is bearer",

Wachovia Bank, N.A. \n2006 WL 773020 (Penn. [Trial Court] 2006) \n \nAbramson, J. \n \nBackground \nThis is a subrogation action brought by the insurance carrier for plaintiff Victory Clothing, Inc. \n(“Victory”), to recover funds paid to Victory under an insurance policy. This matter arises out of thefts \nfrom Victory’s commercial checking account by its office manager and bookkeeper, Jeanette Lunny \n(“Lunny”). Lunny was employed by Victory for approximately twenty-four (24) years until she resigned in \nMay 2003. From August 2001 through May 2003, Lunny deposited approximately two hundred (200) \nchecks drawn on Victory’s corporate account totaling $188,273.00 into her personal checking account at \ndefendant Wachovia Bank (“Wachovia”). Lunny’s scheme called for engaging in “double forgeries” \n(discussed infra). Lunny would prepare the checks in the company’s computer system, and make the \nchecks payable to known vendors of Victory (e.g., Adidas, Sean John), to whom no money was actually \nowed. The checks were for dollar amounts that were consistent with the legitimate checks to those \nvendors. She would then forge the signature of Victory’s owner, Mark Rosenfeld (“Rosenfeld”), on the \nfront of the check, and then forge the indorsement of the unintended payee (Victory’s various vendors) on \nthe reverse side of the check. The unauthorized checks were drawn on Victory’s bank account at Hudson",

Double Forgeries \nAs stated supra, this case involves a double forgery situation. This matter presents a question of first \nimpression in the Pennsylvania state courts, namely how should the loss be allocated in double forgery \nsituations. A double forgery occurs when the negotiable instrument contains both a forged maker’s [bank \ncustomer’s] signature and a forged indorsement. The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC” or “Code”) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n838 \naddresses the allocation of liability in cases where either the maker’s signature is forged or where the \nindorsement of the payee or holder is forged. [Citation] (“the Code accords separate treatment to forged \ndrawer signatures…and forged indorsements”). However, the drafters of the UCC failed to specifically \naddress the allocation of liability in double forgery situations.…Consequently, the courts have been left to \ndetermine how liability should be allocated in a double forgery case.… \n \nII. The Effect of the UCC Revisions \nIn 1990, new revisions to Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC were implemented (the “revisions”).…The new \nrevisions made a major change in the area of double forgeries. Before the revisions, the case law was \nuniform in treating a double forgery case as a forged drawer’s signature case [only], with the loss falling \n[only] on the drawee bank. The revisions, however, changed this rule by shifting to a comparative fault \napproach. Under the revised version of the UCC, the loss in double forgery cases is allocated between the \ndepositary and drawee banks based on the extent that each contributed to the loss.… \n \nSpecifically, revised § 3-405 of the UCC, entitled “Employer’s Responsibility for Fraudulent Indorsement \nby Employee,” introduced the concept of comparative fault as between the employer of the dishonest \nemployee/embezzler and the bank(s). This is the section under which Victory sued Wachovia. Section 3-\n405(b) states, in relevant part:",

This is the section under which Victory sued Wachovia. Section 3-\n405(b) states, in relevant part: \n \nIf the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise \nordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss \nresulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to \nexercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. \n \nWachovia argues that this section is applicable only in cases of forged indorsements, and not in double \nforgery situations. However, at least one court has found that the new revisions have made section 3-405 \napply to double forgery situations. “Nothing in the [Revised UCC] statutory language indicates that, where \nthe signature of the drawer is forged…the drawer is otherwise precluded from seeking recovery from a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n839 \ndepositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII. The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement: \n(1) Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder. \n(2) An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as \nthe indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes \nit for value or for collection.… \n \nThe theory under the rule is that since the indorsement is “effective,” the drawee bank was justified in \ndebiting the company’s account.

Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the \ncheck jointly to Gill and Wisner as co-payees. Had the government done so, there would be no question as \nto Wisner’s entitlement to a portion of the proceeds from the check. \n \nAlthough the writing on the back of the check is referred to as an indorsement, we note that, standing \nalone, it does not truly conform to the definition found in 3-204(a) [which states]: \n \n“Indorsement” means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer, or acceptor, that",

On August 2, Betsy gives the note to Al as a token of her affection. Al is Clifford’s friend and knows \nabout the scam (see Figure 21.1 \"The Shelter Rule\"). May Al collect? \n \nFigure 21.1 The Shelter Rule \n \n \nBegin the analysis by noting that Al is not an HDC. Why? For three reasons: he did not take the \ninstrument for value (it was a gift), he did not take in good faith (he knew of the fraud), and he had notice \n(he acquired it after the due date). Nevertheless, Al is entitled to collect from Harold the full $250,000. \nHis right to do so flows from UCC, Section 3-203(b): “Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the \ntransfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, \nincluding any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due \ncourse by a direct or indirect transfer from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or \nillegality affecting the instrument.” \n \nBy virtue of the shelter rule, Al as transferee from Betsy acquires all rights that she had as transferor. \nClearly Betsy is an HDC: she paid for the instrument, she took it in good faith, had no notice of any claim \nor defense against the instrument, and there were no apparent irregularities. Since Betsy is an HDC, so is \nAl. His knowledge of the fraud does not undercut his rights as HDC because he was not a party to it and \nwas not a prior holder. Now suppose that after negotiating the instrument to Betsy, Clifford repurchased \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n861 \nit from her. He would not be an HDC—and would not acquire all Betsy’s rights—because he had been a \nparty to fraud and as a prior holder had notice of a defense. The purpose of the shelter rule is “to assure \nthe holder in due course a free market for the paper.”[2] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine is important because it allows the holder of a negotiable instrument to take \nthe paper free from most claims and defenses against it. Without the doctrine, such a holder would be a mere \ntransferee. The UCC provides that to be an HDC, a person must be a holder of paper that is not suspiciously \nirregular, and she must take it in good faith, for value, and without notice of anything that a reasonable \nperson would recognize as tainting the instrument.

Hauser Co. appeals the grant of summary judgment.…We affirm. \n \nIn October 1998, Alfred M. Hauser, president of Hauser Co., was notified by Edwards Food Store in \nRaritan and the Somerset Valley Bank (the Bank), that several individuals were cashing what appeared to \nbe Hauser Co. payroll checks. Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) to provide payroll services and a \nfacsimile signature was utilized on all Hauser Co. payroll checks. \n \nMr. Hauser executed affidavits of stolen and forged checks at the Bank, stopping payment on the checks at \nissue. Subsequently, the Bank received more than eighty similar checks valued at $25,000 all drawn on \nHauser Co.’s account. \nPlaintiff is in the business of purchasing dishonored negotiable instruments. In February and March 1999, \nplaintiff purchased eighteen dishonored checks from four different check cashing agencies, specifying \nHauser Co. as the drawer. The checks totaled $8,826.42. Pursuant to assignment agreements executed by \nplaintiff, each agency stated that it cashed the checks for value, in good faith, without notice of any claims \nor defenses to the checks, without knowledge that any of the signatures were unauthorized or forged, and \nwith the expectation that the checks would be paid upon presentment to the bank upon which the checks \nwere drawn.

In such cases, the \ntransferee-holder can still sue a prior party on one or more of the five implied warranties. \n \nA person who receives consideration for transferring an instrument makes the five warranties listed in \nUCC Section 3-416.

The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it \n(when there was), or that the drawer’s signature was authorized (when it was not), or that there were \nsufficient funds in the drawer’s account to pay it (when there were not), “the drawee may recover the \namount paid…or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.” [6]Except—and it’s a big \nexception—such a recovery of funds does not apply “against a person who took the instrument in good \nfaith and for value.” [7] The drawee in that case would have to go after the forger, the unauthorized signer, \nor, in the case of insufficient funds, the drawer. Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it. Able’s bank cannot get the money back from Baker: it has to go after",

Understand how the obligations represented by commercial paper may be discharged. \n \n \nOverview \nNegotiable instruments eventually die. The obligations they represent are discharged (terminated) in two \ngeneral ways: (1) according to the rules stated in Section 3-601 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or \n(2) by an act or agreement that would discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract (e.g., \ndeclaring bankruptcy). \n \nDischarge under the Uniform Commercial Code \nThe UCC provides a number of ways by which an obligor on an instrument is discharged from liability, \nbut notwithstanding these several ways, under Section 3-601, no discharge of any party provided by the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n908 \nrules presented in this section operates against a subsequent holder in due course unless she has notice \nwhen she takes the instrument. \n \nDischarge in General \nDischarge by Payment \nA person primarily liable discharges her liability on an instrument to the extent of payment by paying or \notherwise satisfying the holder, and the discharge is good even if the payor knows that another has claim \nto the instrument. However, discharge does not operate if the payment is made in bad faith to one who \nunlawfully obtained the instrument (and UCC Section 3-602(b) lists two other exceptions). \n \n \n \nDischarge by Tender \nA person who tenders full payment to a holder on or after the date due discharges any subsequent liability \nto pay interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees (but not liability for the face amount of the instrument). If the \nholder refuses to accept the tender, any party who would have had a right of recourse against the party \nmaking the tender is discharged. Mario makes a note payable to Carol, who indorses it to Ed. On the date \nthe payment is due, Mario (the maker) tenders payment to Ed, who refuses to accept the payment; he \nwould rather collect from Carol. Carol is discharged: had she been forced to pay as indorser in the event of \nMario’s refusal, she could have looked to him for recourse. Since Mario did tender, Ed can no longer look \nto Carol for payment. [1] \n \nDischarge by Cancellation and Renunciation",

Since Mario did tender, Ed can no longer look \nto Carol for payment. [1] \n \nDischarge by Cancellation and Renunciation \nThe holder may discharge any party, even without consideration, by marking the face of the instrument or \nthe indorsement in an unequivocal way, as, for example, by intentionally canceling the instrument or the \nsignature by destruction or mutilation or by striking out the party’s signature. The holder may also \nrenounce his rights by delivering a signed writing to that effect or by surrendering the instrument itself. [2] \n \nDischarge by Material and Fraudulent Alteration \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n909 \nUnder UCC Section 3-407, if a holder materially and fraudulently alters an instrument, any party whose \ncontract is affected by the change is discharged. A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered \ninstrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith, and without notice of the alteration, may enforce \nrights with respect to the instrument according to its original terms or, if the incomplete instrument was \naltered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed. \n• \nExample 1: Marcus makes a note for $100 payable to Pauline. Pauline fraudulently raises the \namount to $1,000 without Marcus’s negligence and negotiates it to Ned, who qualifies as a holder \nin due course (HDC). Marcus owes Ned $100. \n• \nExample 2: Charlene writes a check payable to Lumber Yard and gives it to Contractor to buy \nmaterial for a deck replacement. Contractor fills it in for $1,200: $1,000 for the decking and $200 \nfor his own unauthorized purposes. Lumber Yard, if innocent of any wrongdoing, could enforce \nthe check for $1,200, and Charlene must go after Contractor for the $200. \n \nDischarge by Certification \nAs we have noted, where a drawee certifies a draft for a holder, the drawer and all prior indorsers are \ndischarged. \n \nDischarge by Acceptance Varying a Draft \nIf the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of the drawer and any \nindorsers who do not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged. [3] \n \nDischarge of Indorsers and Accommodation Parties \nThe liability of indorsers and accommodation parties is discharged under the following three \ncircumstances.

Various rules govern the permutations of signatures when an \nagent and a principal are involved. \n \nThe maker of a note and the acceptor of a draft have primary contract liability on the instruments. \nSecondarily liable are drawers and indorsers. Conditions precedent to secondary liability are presentment, \ndishonor, and notice of dishonor. Under the proper circumstances, any of these conditions may be waived \nor excused. \n \nPresentment is a demand for payment made on the maker, acceptor, or drawee, or a demand for \nacceptance on the drawee. Presentment must be made (1) at the time specified in the instrument unless \nno time is specified, in which case it must be at the time specified for payment, or (2) within a reasonable \ntime if a sight instrument. \n \nDishonor occurs when acceptance or payment is refused after presentment, at which time a holder has the \nright of recourse against secondary parties if he has given proper notice of dishonor. \n \nA seller-transferor of any commercial paper gives five implied warranties, which become valuable to a \nholder seeking to collect in the event that there has been no indorsement or the indorsement has been \nqualified.

The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used. The \nbank upon which a check is written is the payor bank (the drawee bank). The depository bank is the \none the payee deposits the check into. Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks.

Bank \nof L.A. is a depository bank and a collecting bank. Any other bank through which the check travels (except \nthe two banks already mentioned) is an intermediary bank. \n \nCollection Process between Customers of the Same Bank \nIf the depository bank is also the payor bank (about 30% of all checks), the check is called an “on-us” item \nand UCC 4-215(e)(2) provides that—if the check is not dishonored—it is available by the payee “at the \nopening of the bank’s second banking day following receipt of the item.” Roger writes a check to Matthew, \nboth of whom have accounts at Seattle Bank; Matthew deposits the check on Monday. On Wednesday the \ncheck is good for Matthew (he may have been given “provisional credit” before then, as discussed below, \nthe bank could subtract the money from his account if Roger didn’t have enough to cover the check). \n \nCollection Process between Customers of Different Banks \nRoger in Seattle writes a check on Seattle Bank payable to Julia in L.A. Julia deposits it in her account at \nL.A. Bank, the depository bank. L.A. Bank must somehow present the check to Seattle Bank either directly \nor through intermediary banks. If the collecting banks (again, all of them except Seattle Bank) act before \nthe midnight deadline following receipt, they have acted “seasonably” according to UCC 4-202. When the \npayor bank—Seattle Bank—gets the check it must pay it, unless the check is dishonored or returned (UCC \n4-302). \n \nPhysical Movement of Checks \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n941 \nThe physical movement of checks—such as it still occurs—is handled by three possible systems. \n \nThe Federal Reserve System’s regional branches process checks for banks holding accounts with them. \nThe Feds charge for the service, and prior to 2004 it regularly included check collection, air \ntransportation of checks to the Reserve Bank (hired out to private contractors) and ground transportation \ndelivery of checks to paying banks. Reserve Banks handle about 27 percent of US checks, but the air \nservice is decreasing with “Check 21,” a federal law discussed below, that allows electronic transmission of \nchecks. \n \nCorrespondent banks are banks that have formed “partnerships” with other banks in order to",

Outside banks may go \nthrough a correspondent bank to exchange checks and payments with one of its partners. \n \nCorrespondent banks may also form a clearinghouse corporation, in which members exchange \nchecks and payments in bulk, instead of on a check-by-check basis, which can be inefficient considering \nthat each bank might receive thousands of checks in a day. The clearinghouse banks save up the checks \ndrawn on other members and exchange them on a daily basis. The net payments for these checks are often \nsettled through Fedwire, a Federal Reserve Board electronic funds transfer (EFT) system that handles \nlarge-scale check settlement among US banks. Correspondent banks and clearinghouse corporations \nmake up the private sector of check clearing, and together they handle about 43 percent of US checks. \n \nThe Electronic System: Check 21 Act \nRationale for the “Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act” \nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, Congress felt with renewed urgency that banks needed to present \nand clear checks in a way not dependent upon the physical transportation of the paper instruments by air \nand ground, in case such transportation facilities were disrupted. The federal Check Clearing for the 21st \nCentury Act (Public Law 108-100)—more commonly referred to as “Check 21 Act”—became effective in \n2004. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n942 \nBasic Idea of Check 21 Act \nCheck 21 Act provides the legal basis for the electronic transportation of check data. A bank scans the \ncheck. The data on the check is already encoded in electronically readable numbers and the data, now \nseparated (“truncated”) from the paper instrument (which may be destroyed), is transmitted for \nprocessing. “The Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, to replace the \noriginal check. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that is suitable for \nautomated processing in the same manner as the original check. The Act permits banks to provide \nsubstitute checks in place of original checks to subsequent parties in the check processing stream.…Any",

Section 4-104 defines “item” as “an instrument or a promise or order \nto pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment[,]…not including a credit or debit card slip.” A \npayor bank is any bank that must pay a check because it is drawn on the bank or accepted there—the \ndrawee bank (a depositary bank may also be a payor bank). A collecting bank is any bank except the payor \nbank that handles the item for collection. \n \nTechnical Rules \nDetailed coverage of Parts 2 and 3 of Article 4, the substantive provisions, is beyond the scope of this \nbook. However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2. May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.” \nIf the customer fails to indorse a check when depositing it in his account, the bank’s notation that the \ncheck was deposited by a customer or credited to his account takes effect as the customer’s \nindorsement. (Section 4-205(1)). \n3. Are any warranties given in the collection process? Yes. They are identical to those provided in \nArticle 3, except that they apply only to customers and collecting banks (4-207(a)). The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund? The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First",

The bank’s liability is limited to the damages \nactually proved; these may include damages for arrest and prosecution. See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under \n“Bank’s Liability for Paying over Customer’s ‘Stop Payment’ Order” (Meade v. National Bank of Adams \nCounty). \n \nCustomers’ Duties \nIn order to hold a bank liable for paying out an altered check, the customer has certain duties under \nSection 4-406. Primarily, the customer must act promptly in examining her statement of account and \nmust notify the bank if any check has been altered or her signature has been forged. If the customer fails \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n948 \nto do so, she cannot recover from the bank for an altered signature or other term if the bank can show that \nit suffered a loss because of the customer’s slowness. Recovery may also be denied when there has been a \nseries of forgeries and the customer did not notify the bank within two weeks after receiving the first \nforged item. See Section 23.4 \"Cases\" under “Customer’s Duty to Inspect Bank Statements” (the Planters \nBank v. Rogers case). \n \nThese rules apply to a payment made with ordinary care by the bank. If the customer can show that the \nbank negligently paid the item, then the customer may recover from the bank, regardless of how dilatory \nthe customer was in notifying the bank—with two exceptions: (1) from the time she first sees the \nstatement and item, the customer has one year to tell the bank that her signature was unauthorized or \nthat a term was altered, and (2) she has three years to report an unauthorized indorsement. \n \nThe Expedited Funds Availability Act \nIn General \nIn addition to UCC Article 4 (again, state law), the federal Expedited Funds Availability Act—also referred \nto as “Regulation CC” after the Federal Reserve regulation that implements it—addresses an aspect of the \nrelationship between a bank and its customers.

The book is\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\nPreface\n1\neconomics, depending on student preparation. It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\nPedagogical Foundation\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies.

The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget.

However, without the planning and ability to raise capital facilitated by the financing plan, the firm would\nnot have been able to act on its strengths at the critical moment. Financing was the key to expansion and\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\n1.1\nWhat Is Finance?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the main areas in finance.\n•\nExplain the importance of studying finance.\n•\nDiscuss the concepts of risk and return.\nDefinition of Finance\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\ndecision makers.\nBasic Areas in Finance\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\nBusiness Finance\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\nrisky environment.

Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\n1\nDun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\n8\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n1.\nWorking capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\nthey are separate.\n2.\nCapital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\nvalue of the firm.\n3.\nCapital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and",

In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows.

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short.

Financial decision makers rely\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\nconsumers.\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\nsupply and demand.\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\nMacroeconomics\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\ngroups.

Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives.

Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\nforecasting models.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPolitics and Stock Markets\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this fun comparison chart\n(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net) of political economic performance that measures stock market\nreturns by each administration going back to President Warren Harding in 1920. Who had the highest\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\nBarack Obama?\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too\nsmall to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by\nchanges in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills\nhas exceeded $75 billion.9\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\n2008.\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\nCP.

Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\nCP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\npaper until maturity.\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\nmaturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other\ntypes of deposits.\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on\n9\nHenrik Bessembinder, Chester Spatt, and Kumar Venkataraman. “A Survey of the Microstructure of Fixed-Income Markets.”\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.

Even though this is a business finance text,\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,\ndespite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate\nof return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369.

In both scenarios, only\nfive $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents\ncould make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments.

In\npublicly traded companies, managers and employees work on behalf of the shareholders, who own the\nbusiness through their ownership of company stock. These managers and employees have an ongoing\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\nSome examples of these might include the following:\n•\nExpanding sales to existing customers\n•\nIncreasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\n•\nDeveloping new products for current and potential customers\n•\nBecoming international by setting up an online ordering service\nCorporate Structure and Governance\n2\n2 • Why It Matters\n39\n•\nImproving customer satisfaction with customer services\nIf managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place.

In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized.

However, it is still important to\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\nSole Proprietorships\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\n1.\nThey have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\n1\nAaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings. The Brookings Institution, May 15, 2017.\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses\n40\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n2.\nThey are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations.\n3.\nTaxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\n4.\nControlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\nshortcomings:\n1.\nA sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the",

This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation.

They are entitled to vote on\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\ncompany’s financial statements.\nTypes of Shareholders\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid.

In order for companies to avoid such problems, it is imperative\nthat they address the underlying problems of these differences.

Even the threat\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest.

These will\noften differ significantly from those in the United States.\nIn recent years, accounting regulations in countries outside the United States have come under the jurisdiction\nof International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It should be noted that guidelines and regulations under\nIFRS and those under GAAP can differ significantly. As a result of these regulatory differences, any specific\ndivergences in accounting or governance practices between foreign subsidiaries and a US parent company\nshould be clearly stated and disclosed in the parent company’s financial reports.\nGlobal firms have substantial operations and investments in different countries (global markets), and they\nmay have no single center or basis of operational activity. In such cases, regulations for corporate governance\nare usually determined by the laws of the country in which the parent company has been established. While\nthere are some global firms that report their financial statements according to GAAP standards, usually to\nsatisfy the informational needs of US investors, most global parent companies’ financials will adhere to IFRS\nreporting standards.\nDifference in Financial Reporting: GAAP versus IFRS\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were\ndesigned with similar objectives in mind: to provide a common and structured set of guidelines to assist in the\npreparation of accurate and unbiased financial reporting for public corporations.\nYet despite these commonalities in purpose, there are important differences between them. Among these are\ndifferences in inventory accounting and reporting, guidelines for consolidation of subsidiaries, and the\naccounting and reporting of minority interests.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGAAP and IFRS",

If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\npurchased.

In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity.

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\nof\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\nexchange rate.\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\ndollars.

You can enter the amount of one\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\nCurrency Appreciation\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk.

When\nthe index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency.

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\nCash-Basis Accounting\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris",

We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization.

So when do you\nrecognize revenue?\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\ngovernment.\nExpense Recognition\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers.

If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\ntypically capitalized. Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense.

Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of\ntime, but rather in the usage of the machine?\nDouble-Declining-Balance Depreciation\nThe double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it\naccounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under\nstraight-line depreciation. To calculate this, divide 100 percent by the estimated life in years. For example, a\nfive-year asset would be 100/5, or 20 percent a year. A four-year asset would be 100/4, or 25 percent a year.\nNext, because assets are typically more efficient and are used more heavily early in their life span, the double-\n118\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndeclining method takes usage into account by doubling the straight-line percentage. For a four-year asset,\nmultiply 25 percent\n, or 50 percent. For a five-year asset, multiply 20 percent\n, or 40 percent.\nOne unique feature of the double-declining-balance method is that in the first year, the estimated salvage\nvalue is not subtracted from the total asset cost before calculating the first year’s depreciation expense.\nInstead, the total cost is multiplied by the calculated percentage. However, depreciation expense is not\npermitted to take the book value below the estimated salvage value, as demonstrated in Figure 4.15.\nFigure 4.15 Depreciation Expense, Accumulated Depreciation, and Book Value, Years 1–5",

High-quality earnings are based on\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks.

We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\nProfit versus Cash Flow\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the",

These\nstatements are the income statement, balance sheet, statement of owner’s equity, and statement of cash\nflows. Each statement provides different insights into a firm’s performance and financial health. Though some\nusers may favor one or two statements over another, they are best used together to get a full picture.\nIn this chapter, you’ll be introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\nsmall merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to consumers) that sells\nhunting and fishing gear. It needs financial statements to understand its profitability and current financial\nposition, manage cash flow, and communicate its finances to outside parties like investors, governing bodies,\nand lenders.

Thus, the statements are prepared in a\nspecific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.",

They begin with\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin\ngross profit/sales.) Cost of\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\ntheir Cost of Goods section.

The classified\nbalance sheet shows the financial state of a company as of a specific point in time. It is a key distinction\nbetween the two statements. The classified balance sheet is prepared in sections that align with the\naccounting equation.\nRemember, the accounting equation reflects the assets (items owned by the organization) and how they\nwere obtained (by incurring liabilities or provided by owners). Liabilities are debts owed to other parties.\nStated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nThe classified balance sheet is thus broken down into three sections; assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity.

Current assets are those that can be used or converted to cash within a year. Common examples of\ncurrent assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Assets that will be in\nuse longer than a year are considered noncurrent. Common examples of noncurrent assets include notes\nreceivable, machinery and equipment, buildings, and land.\nJust as we noted a few key differences in the income statements based on the type of firm, you may also notice\na few slight differences in the balance sheet depending on the firm type. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\nretailer. Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”\nThis is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of\ncleaning supplies.\nFigure 5.6 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.\nIt rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets.

(Amounts are in\nmillions.)\nWe’ve covered the assets side of the accounting equation; now let’s turn our attention to the other side of the\nequation and the other two sections of the balance sheet: liabilities and equity. Just like the assets section, the\nliabilities section is broken down between current and noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be\ndue within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and\nunearned revenue. Noncurrent liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes\npayable is a common noncurrent liability.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it\nhasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts\npayable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities.

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable?

In this case, the company incurred\nutilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts\npayable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable\nand reduce cash. Accounts payable is a liability found on the balance sheet, normally a current liability.

Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\nother assets as well.\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\nexisting shareholders.\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\ncash for other investments.\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding.

A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses. Accepting\n148\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnet 10 terms requires the firm to give up its cash quickly, while pushing for more favorable terms like net 30 or\nnet 60 allows the firm to wait much longer to give up its cash.\nIt is important to assess both sides of cash flow and the impact it has on the firm as well as the customer and\nvendor relationships it maintains. Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\npayment terms.\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\ncash flow fluctuates.\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\nin evaluating them: common-size statements.

This makes it easier to compare figures from one period to the next,\ncompare departments within an organization, and compare the firm to other companies of any size as well as\nindustry averages. On the income statement, analysts can see how much of sales revenue is spent on each\ntype of expense. They can see this breakdown for each firm and compare how different firms function in terms\nof expenses, proportionally. They can also look at the percentage for each expense over time to see if they are\nspending more or less on certain areas of the business, such as research and development. On the balance\nsheet, analysts commonly look to see the percentage of debt and equity to determine capital structure. They\ncan also quickly see the percentage of current versus noncurrent assets and liabilities.\nIn Clear Lake Sporting Goods’ common-size income statement for the current and prior years, we can see that\ncost of goods as a percentage of sales remained the same (see Figure 5.24).

Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as\nCharlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of\nits sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent.

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,",

Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\non a regular basis.

Examples of the most liquid assets include\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account).

This\nconcept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a\ndollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now\ncan be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any\npromise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for\npeople to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make\nthem at some future time.\nFor this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering\nthem greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to\nus, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our\npossession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other\npoint in the future.\nThe entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors\nto make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand\nwhich option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.",

This will have the effect of accelerating the growth of the total dollar value of the\naccount.\nThis is the important effect of the compounding of interest: money grows in larger and larger increments the\nlonger you leave it in an interest-bearing account. In effect, the compounding of interest over time accelerates\nthe growth of money.\nIn order to determine the FV of any amount of money, it will always be necessary to know the following pieces\nof information: (1) the principal, initial deposit, or present value (PV); (2) the rate of interest, usually\nexpressed on an annual basis as r; and (3) the number of time periods that the money will remain in the\naccount (n). The interest rate is often referred to as the growth rate, or the annual percentage increase on\nsavings or on an investment. When the rate is raised to the power of the number of periods, the formula\nwill yield a number that is commonly referred to as the future value interest factor (FVIF). As a result\nof this process, as n (time, or the number of periods) increases, the future value interest factor will increase.\nAlso, as r (interest rate) increases, the FVIF will increases.

Unfortunately, you\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\ncost after six years?\nSolution:\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\nvalue of our money.

This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\ninto the account during the year.

His friend suggests finding an\naccount or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.\nMelvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found\ninvestments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the\nfuture calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before\nmoving ahead and putting your money in any investment or financial instrument.\n7.3\nMethods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how future dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nExplain how present dollar amounts are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how discount rates are calculated.\n•\nDescribe how growth rates are calculated.\n•\nIllustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.\n•\nUse a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.\nWe can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with\nfinancial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables. With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text. Nevertheless, they are often still published in\nother finance textbooks and are also available on the internet to use if you so choose.\nUsing Timelines to Organize TVM Information\nA useful tool for conceptualizing present value and future value problems is a timeline.

Each timeline shows today at the\nleft and a desired ending, or future point (maturity date), at the right.\nNow, let us take an example of a future value problem that has a time frame of five years. Before we begin to\nsolve for any answers, it would be a good approach to lay out a timeline like that shown in Table 7.1:\nYear\n0\n(Today)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTable 7.1\nThe timeline provides a visual reference for us and puts the problem into perspective.\nNow, let’s say that we are interested in knowing what today’s balance of $100 in our saving account, earning\n5% annually, will be worth at the end of each of the next five years. Using the future value formula\nthat we covered earlier, we would arrive at the following values: $105 at the end of year one, $110.25 at the\nend of year two, $115.76 at the end of year three, $121.55 at the end of year four, and $127.63 at the end of\nyear five.\nWith the numerical information, the timeline (at a 5% interest or growth rate) would look like Table 7.2:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n$100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $121.55 $127.63\nTable 7.2\nUsing timelines to lay out TVM problems becomes more and more valuable as problems become more\ncomplex. You should get into the habit of using a timeline to set up these problems prior to using the\nequation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet to help minimize input errors. Now we will move on to the different\nmethods available that will help you solve specific TVM problems. These are the financial calculator and the\nExcel spreadsheet.\nUsing a Financial Calculator to Solve TVM Problems\nAn extremely popular method of solving TVM problems is through the use of a financial calculator. Financial\ncalculators such as the Texas Instruments BAII Plus™ Professional (https://openstax.org/r/baii-plus-\nprofessional) will typically have five keys that represent the critical variables used in most common TVM\nproblems: NN, I/Y\nI/Y, PV\nPV, FV\nFV, and PMT\nPMT. These represent the following:\nThese are the only keys on a financial calculator that are necessary to solve TVM problems involving a single\npayment or lump sum.\nExample 1: Future Value of a Single Payment or Lump Sum",

This is because most financial calculators\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the -- (minus) key).\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-\n+|- key instead of the minus key. If you\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-\n+|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the\nfuture value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n198\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof 4.

By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%\ninterest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the\nPV function is used to determine present value (see Figure 7.7).\nFigure 7.7 Using the PV Function in Excel\nThe formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also\nsimilar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6.

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\ninto the future.\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\nas time goes by under such conditions.\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services.

Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\nservices they may require.

Decision-\nmakers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into\nthe future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past\nperiods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving\nforward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to\nvisualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.\nThroughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount. In this chapter,\nwe deal with a stream of payments made periodically—in other words, payments made or received regularly\nover a span of time.

Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.\nSome investments might involve a growing perpetuity. In this case, some degree of change in the amount of\nthe dividend is expected. The formula is altered slightly to include a rate of growth in the denominator, noted\nas G, making the growing perpetuity formula\n8.1 • Perpetuities\n229\nTo illustrate a growing perpetuity, let’s revisit Rooney Corp.’s stock, with its annual dividend of $1.75 and a\nrequired rate of return in the market of 5.8%. If the expected dividend growth rate G is 1.2%, then the value\nchanges to\n, or $38.04. The expectation of growth in the dividend provides incentive for the\ninvestor to pay a higher price.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nA Growing Perpetuity\nSavo Corporation. While we think of perpetuities as being static, with a constant benefit or dividend, as\nseen above, they might have the possibility of growth.

Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\ninterest from past periods.\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity.

We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.\nThe formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of\nannual interest.\n2.\nWe accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once\nthe last payment is withdrawn.\n3.\nThe last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last.

These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data\nbeing supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\nIndividuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can\ndo for no charge.

A common example is an\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\n•\nA mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\nremains on the debt.\n•\nStudent loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\nfinancial institution or the federal government.

Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer.

These loans allow you to\ndetermine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against\nyour expected refund.2 But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\nfour weeks.\nSolution:\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\nof $800.

Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The\ndollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t\nattempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as an absolute\nreference (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.9 Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table\n3.\nThe next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this\ncase cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference.

Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished\ndividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\n8.2 Annuities\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\n8.3 Loan Amortization\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\ndescribed.\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\nExcel.\nKey Terms\nannuity",

But a\nprofessional decision maker must “hit it out of the park” when making major capital investment choices and\nrecommendations.\nAs a student in a course of business studies and career development, it is highly likely that you will be a\ndecision maker about projects that are likely to generate future cash flows but will also require a large initial\nexpense. When you ask your manager to invest $500,000 or more in a new piece of equipment that could help\nyour department meet or exceed its goals, you must be prepared to defend your request. Competing\nmanagers and departments will be asking for similar funding, and there simply might not be enough for\neveryone. This decision process requires financial analysis.\nMark Cuban of Shark Tank fame enjoys citing the series’ catchphrase: “Know thy numbers.” As a business\nprofessional, you must be able to assess potential profit against expenditures to be successful. In most cases,\nthis is based on our understanding of cash flow. A major capital investment might seem initially like a gamble,\nbut it is a gamble that can be hedged in your favor with understanding, analysis, and knowledge of your\nnumbers.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to give you information and instruction on how this is done.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions.

This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.\nWe closed this excellent interview with agreement that we were “kindred spirits” regarding the importance\nof cash flow analysis, including capital decisions such as those mentioned in this chapter. We confirmed\nwith each other the core belief that “cash flow is the axis upon which the world of business spins.”\n(source: Business Finance: A Clear View, 3rd edition, by Alan S. Adams.

Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser.

This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nannually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the coupon rate will have to\nbe divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate to the correct periodic rate. In our\nexample, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or annual interest that is paid is equal to\n. You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at\nregular intervals, they constitute an annuity stream (refer to Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple\nPayments.\n•\nMaturity date: The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the term of\na bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or coupon payment\non the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example, the maturity date is at the end\nof the 20-year period.\n•\nYield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a\nbond into present value terms.

These investments are considered safe\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING",

Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors.

The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase. An exception to this general rule\nis floating-rate bonds (often referred to as “floaters,” floating-rate notes, or FRNs).\n10.1 • Characteristics of Bonds\n287\nFigure 10.3 The Seesaw Effect of Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nA floating-rate note is a form of debt instrument that is similar to a standard fixed-rate bond but has a variable\ninterest rate.

These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value.

The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of\nassets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. What is its value\nto these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\nfrom willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you\nwant to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.\nLet’s begin our pricing examples with the 3M Company corporate bond listed in Table 10.1 above. The table\n288\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninformation tells us that 3M issued a series of corporate bonds that promise to pay coupons annually on\nSeptember 19 and to pay back the principal, or face value, on the maturity date of September 19, 2026.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments.

This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called a yield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting\nprocess and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will\nalways be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or time periods on\nthe x-axis (see Figure 10.5).\nTo create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds\nat all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year\nremaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on the y-axis against the one-year\nterm on the x-axis.

The level\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\ndiffer significantly over time.

The most common and best-known\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\nrisks are the following:\n•\nCredit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk.

Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on.

The coupon rate of a\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\n20 coupon payments equal to\nor\nfor a total of $1,000.\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\nGenerating Capital Gains\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio.

This could signal a possible undesired downward\nadjustment in market price in the future.\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term.

The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year.

The Gordon growth model determines a stock’s value based on a\nfuture stream of dividends that grows at a constant rate. Again, we assume that this constantly growing\ndividend stream will pay forever. To see how the constant growth model works, let’s use our example from\nabove once again as a test case. The most recent dividend (D0) is $1.76, the growth rate (g) is 10.44%, and the\nrequired rate of return (r) is 13.5%, so applying our PV equation, we have\nOur estimated price for this example is $63.52. Notice that the formula requires the return rate r to be greater\nthan the growth rate g of the dividend stream. If g were greater than r, we would be dividing by a negative\nnumber and producing a negative price, which would be meaningless.\nLet’s pick another company and see if we can apply the dividend growth model and price the company’s stock",

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\ntaxes.\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model.

We arrive at this amount by applying the discount rate of 8% for a one-year period to determine\nthe present value.\nIn subsequent years, Mayweather’s cash flow will be increasing by 3%. These future cash flows also must be\ndiscounted back to present values at an 8% rate, so the discounted cash flow amounts over the next six years\nwill be as follows:\nOur earlier assumption that the terminal value will be 2.5 times the value in the sixth year gives us a total\nterminal cash flow (TCF) of\n, or $3,652,697.

Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future. It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock.

These three forms constitute the efficient market hypothesis.\nBelievers in these three forms of efficient markets maintain, in varying degrees, that it is pointless to search\nfor undervalued stocks, sell stocks at inflated prices, or predict market trends.\nIn weak form efficient markets, current prices reflect the stock’s price history and trading volume. It is useless\nto chart historical stock prices to predict future stock prices such that you can identify mispriced stocks and\nroutinely outperform the market.

For corporations, shares of stock\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners.

So which is the riskier asset?”14 Siegel brings up a valid point\nabout inflation. Returns adjusted for changes in prices provide a better measure of value or wealth. Baseball\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\n14\nJeremy J. Siegel.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\nfixed income.\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average.

Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI\nwas 2.55%.

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates.

When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If\nyou’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”\nBuffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his\nown children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do\nnothing.”\n(Sources: Joshua Kennon. “How Warren Buffett Became One of the Wealthiest People in America.” The\nBalance.

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center.

For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance.

When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs, such as bar graphs, time series graphs, and so on.\nThe most effective type of graph to use for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the data and the\npurpose of the graph. For example, a time series graph is typically used to show how a measurement is\nchanging over time and to identify patterns or trends over time.\nBelow are some examples of typical applications for various graphs and displays.\nGraphs used to show the distribution of data:\n•\nBar chart: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for categorical data\n•\nHistogram: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for continuous data\nGraphs used to show relationships between data points:\n•\nTime series graph: used to show measurement data plotted against time, where time is displayed on the\nhorizontal axis\n•\nScatter plot: used to show the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable\nBar Graphs\nA bar graph consists of bars that are separated from each other and compare percentages.

One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb\nis to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.\nA histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The\nhorizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The\nvertical axis is labeled either Frequency or Relative Frequency (or Percent Frequency or Probability). The graph\nwill have the same shape regardless of the label on the vertical axis. A histogram, like a stem-and-leaf plot, can\ngive you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.\nThe relative frequency is equal to the frequency of an observed data value divided by the total number of data\nvalues in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times a solution occurs. Relative\nfrequency is calculated using the formula\nwhere f = frequency, n = the total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and RF =\nrelative frequency.\nTo construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, will represent the data.\nMany histograms consist of 5 to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose\na starting point for the first interval that is less than the smallest data value.

There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,\nand call this vector example1, as follows:\n> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)\nIf we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector\nname.\n> salaries\n[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000\n> example1\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\nOften, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,\nmedian, quartiles, min, and max.

Max.\n40000 47500 62500 64250 79250 92000\nFor measures of spread, R includes a command for standard deviation, called sd, and a command for variance,\ncalled var. The standard deviation and variance are calculated with the assumption that the data set was\ncollected from a sample.\n> sd(salaries)\n[1] 23641.42\n> var(salaries)\n[1] 558916667\nTo calculate a weighted mean in R, create two vectors, one of which contains the data values and the other of\nwhich contains the associated weights. Then enter the R command weighted.mean(values, weights).\nThe following is an example of a weighted mean calculation in R:\nAssume your portfolio contains 1,000 shares of XYZ Corporation, purchased on three different dates, as shown\nin Table 13.14.

The\nterms mean and average are often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the\nnumbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes\nnot the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing\nthem in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of\nnumbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.\n13.2 Measures of Spread\nThe standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small\nwhen the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard\ndeviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The\nformula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a\npopulation, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are\nslightly different.\n13.3 Measures of Position\nSeveral measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.",

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year.

In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL.

SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global\nAdvisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance. The monthly returns for AMZN are\nvisible in column C. It is important that these returns be lined up so that the returns for a particular month for\nboth securities appear in the same row number. Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to\nthe left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the\nhorizontal axis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nState Street Global Advisors\nYou can learn more about State Street Global Advisors and its creation of the first ETF by visiting the\ncompany’s history page at its website (ssga.com) (https://openstax.org/r/ssga_institutional_our-history).\nYou will use a scatter plot to create a graph.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\nstandard deviation of returns.\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\ndetermined.\nKey Terms\narithmetic average return",

If it purchases the machine, Sam’s will be able to charge customers\nfor customization.\nHow Companies Think about Investing\n16\n16 • Why It Matters\n479\nThe managers think that selling customized items will allow the company to increase its cash flow by $2,000\nnext year. They predict that as customers become more aware of this service, the ability to customize products\nin-house will increase the company’s cash flow by $4,000 the following year. The managers expect the\nmachine will be used for five years, with the embroidery products increasing cash flows by $5,000 during each\nof the last three years the machine is used.

During the first\nyear, Sam’s expects to see a $2,000 benefit from purchasing the machine, but this means that after one year,\nthe company will have spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project. During the second year that it\nuses the machine, Sam’s expects that its cash inflow will be $4,000 greater than it would have been if it had not\nhad the machine.

This video demonstrates how to calculate the payback period\n(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-calculate) in such a situation.\nAdvantages\nThe principal advantage of the payback period method is its simplicity. It can be calculated quickly and easily.\nIt is easy for managers who have little finance training to understand. The payback measure provides\ninformation about how long funds will be tied up in a project. The shorter the payback period of a project, the\ngreater the project’s liquidity.\nDisadvantages\nAlthough it is simple to calculate, the payback period method has several shortcomings. First, the payback\nperiod calculation ignores the time value of money. Suppose that in addition to the embroidery machine,\nSam’s is considering several other projects. The cash flows from these projects are shown in Table 16.2. Both\nProject B and Project C have a payback period of five years. For both of these projects, Sam’s estimates that it\nwill take five years for cash inflows to add up to $16,000.

From what we learned about the time value of\nmoney, Projects B and C are not identical projects. The payback period method breaks the important finance\nrule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.\nA second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or\nrejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\nflows.\n16.1 • Payback Period Method\n481\n16.2\nNet Present Value (NPV) Method\nLearning Outcomes",

This website on calculating the NPV on an MBA degree\n(https://openstax.org/r/calculating-the-NPV) lets you apply this concept in an educational setting. The\ninitial cost of the MBA includes both the dollars spent on tuition and the wages that a full-time student\ncould have earned if they were not in school. Why is it appropriate to include these forgone wages in the\ncalculation? What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\nNPV Profile\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate",

In considering whether Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the\nembroidery machine, the IRR method approaches the time value of money problem from a slightly different\nangle. Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV, as we\ndid in the first NPV equation, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:\nThe IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV profile graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the IRR is greater\nthan the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should\nbe rejected. The NPV profile graph for the embroidery machine crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore,\nif Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the\nembroidery machine should be purchased.

The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money\nfrom investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an\nIRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to\ncompensate the investors for the use of their funds.\nCalculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and\nerror to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-\nand-error iterative process, but because it uses an automated process, it can do so much more quickly than\nyou can.

Investors like to\nspeak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities.\nDisadvantages\nOne disadvantage of using IRR is that it can be tedious to calculate. We knew the IRR was about 14% for the\nembroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR\nis about, but not exactly, 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero (just very close to zero) when we use\n14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact\nIRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later\nin this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.\nNo Single Mathematical Solution. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a\nsingle mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than\none period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic\ncompetition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate\ncash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility\ninto a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows in a timeline\nresults in the following (Table 16.8):\n16.3 • Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\n487\nYear\n0\n1\n2\nCash Flow ($Millions) (350) 950 (620)\nTable 16.8\nThe NPV profile for this project looks like Figure 16.3.

However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV.

This truck is smaller and will not be able to hold as many\nfrozen treats. However, the truck is newer, with lower mileage, and you estimate that you can use it for six\nyears. This newer truck will allow you to generate a cash inflow of $30,000 each year for the next six years. The\nNPV of the newer truck is $80,658.\nBecause both trucks are acceptable projects but you can only drive one truck at a time, you must choose which\ntruck to purchase. At first, it may be tempting to purchase the newer, lower-mileage truck because of its\nhigher NPV. Unfortunately, when comparing two projects that have different lives, a decision cannot be made\nsimply by comparing the NPVs. Although the ice-cream truck with the six-year life span has a much higher NPV\nthan the larger truck, it consumes your resources for a long time.\nThere are two methods for comparing projects with different lives. Both assume that when the short-life\nproject concludes, another, similar project will be available.\nReplacement Chain Approach\nWith the replacement chain approach, as many short-life projects as necessary are strung together to equal\nthe life of the long-life project. You can purchase the newer, lower-mileage ice-cream truck and run your\nbusiness for six years. To make a comparison, you assume that if you purchase the larger truck that will last\nfor three years, you will be able to repeat the same project, purchasing another larger truck that will last for\nthe next three years.

Next, the\nformula for NPV is placed in cell B6; cell B6 shows the NPV of the cash flows in cells D2 through N2, using the\nrate that is in cell B1.\nFor reference, compute IRR in cell B4. Calculating IRR is not necessary for creating the NPV profile. However, it\ngives a good reference point. Remember that if the IRR of a project is greater than the firm’s cost of attracting\ncapital, then the NPV will be positive; if the IRR of a project is less than the firm’s cost of attracting capital, then\nthe NPV will be negative.\nAn NPV profile is created by calculating the NPV of the project for a variety of possible costs of attracting\ncapital.

Some obvious\nthings come to mind when you think of how managers would do this. For example, to maximize the value of\nAmerican Airlines, the managers need to attract customers and sell seats on flights. They also need to keep\ncosts as low as possible, which means keeping the costs of purchasing fuel and making plane repairs as low as\npossible. While the concept of keeping costs low is simple, the specific decisions a firm makes can be complex.\nIf American Airlines wants to purchase a new airplane, it needs to consider not just the dollar cost of the initial\npurchase but also the passenger and cargo capacity of the plane as well as ongoing maintenance costs.\nIn addition to paying salaries to its pilots and flight attendants, American Airlines must pay to use investors’\nmoney. If the company wants to purchase a new airplane, it may borrow money to pay for the plane. Even if\nAmerican Airlines does not need to incur debt to buy the plane, the money it uses to buy the plane ultimately\nbelongs to the owners or shareholders of the company. The company must consider the opportunity cost of\nthis money and the return that shareholders are expecting on their investments.\nJust as different planes have distinctive characteristics and costs, the different types of financing that American\nAirlines can use will have different characteristics and costs.

If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\nAttracting Capital\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\nelsewhere.

However, issues come up when financial managers\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\nmethods provide the same value.\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data.

Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\n515\nNet Debt\nMany practitioners use net debt rather than total debt when calculating the weights for WACC. Net debt is the\namount of debt that would remain if a company used all of its liquid assets to pay off as much debt as\npossible. Net debt is calculated as the firm’s total debt, both short-term and long-term, minus the firm’s cash\nand cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are current assets that can quickly and easily be converted into cash,\nsuch as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and marketable securities.\nConsider, for example, Apple, which had $112.436 billion in total debt in 2020. The company also had $38.016\nbillion in cash and cash equivalents. This meant that the net debt for Apple was only $74.420 billion. If Apple\nused all of its cash and cash equivalents to pay debt, it would be left with $74.420 billion in debt.2\nCash and cash equivalents can be viewed as negative debt. For firms with relatively low levels of cash, this\nadjustment will not have a large impact on the overall WACC estimate.

Netflix has funded much of its content through\nselling debt.\nYou can view the company’s explanation of this capital structure choice by looking at the answers the\ncompany provides to common investor questions (https://openstax.org/r/the-company-provides). You can\nalso find the company’s financial statements on its website and see how the level of debt on Netflix’s\nbalance sheet has increased over the past few years.\nFigure 17.4 demonstrates how the value of a levered firm varies with the level of debt financing used. Vu is the\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\ninterest and taxes (EBIT). Once the interest expense equals EBIT, the firm will have no taxable income. There is\nno tax benefit from paying more interest after that point.\n17.5 • Optimal Capital Structure\n521\nFigure 17.4 Maximum Value of a Levered Firm\nAs the firm increases debt and increases the value of the tax benefit of debt, it also increases the probability of\nfacing financial distress.

It has a promised cash flow to its holders.\nUnlike common equity, the dividend on preferred stock is fixed and known. Also, there are consequences if\nthose preferred dividends are not paid. Common shareholders cannot receive any dividends until preferred\ndividends are paid, and in some cases, preferred shareholders receive voting rights until they are paid the\ndividends that are due.

In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth.

The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are\nrequiring to lend money to the company. Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the\ncompany is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must\nestimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend\ngrowth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).\n17.3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital\nCalculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using the formula\nRemember that the WACC is an estimate; different methods of estimating the cost of equity capital can lead to\ndifferent estimations of WACC.\n17.4 Capital Structure Choices\nAn unlevered firm uses no debt in its capital structure. A levered firm uses both debt and equity in its capital\nstructure. In perfect financial markets, the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the firm’s decision\nto use leverage. With the tax deductibility of interest expenses, however, the value of the firm can increase\nthrough the use of debt. As the level of debt increases, the value of the interest tax shield increases.\n17.5 Optimal Capital Structure\nA company wants to choose a capital structure that maximizes its value. Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also",

The market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital structure."

Because interest expenses are tax-deductible, the cost of debt to the company is less than the YTM. The cost of equity capital is not directly observed, so financial managers must estimate this cost. Two common methods for estimating the cost of equity capital are the constant dividend growth model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)."

Although increasing the level of\nfinancial leverage, or debt, in the capital structure increases the value of the interest tax shield, it also\nincreases the probability of financial distress. As the weight of debt in the capital structure increases, the\nreturn that providers of both debt and equity capital require to entice them to provide money to the firm\nincreases because their risk increases.

It uses financial statements to understand its\nprofitability and current financial position, to manage cash flow, and to communicate its finances to outside\nparties such as investors, governing bodies, and lenders. We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the\naccounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all\ncurrent and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and\nequity. In Figure 18.2, we see that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has total assets of $250,000 in the current year,\nwhich balances with its total liabilities and equity of $250,000.\n536\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.2 Balance Sheet\nThe income statement reflects the performance of the firm over a period of time.

A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance.

Ratios based on balance sheet accounts can be\nuseful for understanding relationships between balance sheet items—how they related in the past and then, in\nforecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same in the future. Examples of balance\nsheet ratios include the current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, debt-to-assets ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio.\nIn Financial Statements, you also explored common-size analysis. To prepare a common-size analysis of the\nbalance sheet, every item on the statement must be expressed as a percentage of total assets. Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function.

We will be using the\npercent-of-sales method to forecast some expenses for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the example used\nthroughout the chapter. This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting\nsales is crucial.\nSales as the Driver\nA significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the\nnecessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product\ncosts, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as\nsales commissions.\nLooking to the Past\nForecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information\nwe do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.\nA firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to\nestimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,\nwhat time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and\nany other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. In Figure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by\nmonth for the past 12 months.\nPast data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from\nprobabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the\nsales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April.

Though not exact, it’s easy to quickly see that\nsales follow a seasonal pattern. We will focus on just one year of data here to keep things simple. However, it’s\nimportant to note that when a firm has a seasonal sales pattern, it normally uses more than one year of data\nto detect and evaluate the pattern. It’s not uncommon for firms to have a seasonal sales pattern that\nfluctuates based on an external factor such as weather patterns, patterns in business or demand, or other\n18.2 • Forecasting Sales\n541\nfactors such as holidays. Common examples might include farm-based businesses that function on a weather\npattern for harvesting and selling crops or a toy company that fluctuates around gift-giving holidays.\nThis knowledge is helpful when assembling a first pass at the next year’s sales forecast. Using common-size\nand horizontal (trend) analyses on sales is also helpful, as shown in Figure 18.8. We can see the exact\npercentages that sales went up or down each month:\n•\nIn January, the company had sales of $9,000, which was\nof the total annual sales.\n•\nIn June, the company had $19,000 sales, which was\nof the total annual sales and\nof January sales.\nFigure 18.8 Historical Sales Data as Percentages\nOnce a baseline in the 12-month period is assessed, it can also be helpful to look for trends in other ways. For\nexample, the past several years might be assessed to see if there is a trend in total growth or decline for those\nyears on a summary basis or by period. Clear Lake Sporting Goods had sales in the current year of $126,000, in\nthe prior year of $105,000, and two years ago of $89,000. This reflects a 20% increase and an 18% increase,\nrespectively. It might be reasonable to expect a roughly 18 to 20% increase in total sales in the future with only\nthis information in mind.

Our\nfocus here, however, is the world of finance. In this realm, the key purpose of pro forma (future-looking)\nfinancial statements is to manage a firm’s cash flow and assess the overall value that the firm is generating\nthrough future sales growth.

The length generally depends on the user’s needs. A one-\nyear forecast, broken down by month, is quite typical. A firm will often go through a formal budgeting process\nnear the end of its calendar or fiscal year to project financial plans and goals for the coming year. Once that is\ndone, a rolling financial forecast is then done monthly to adjust as time moves on, more information becomes\navailable, and circumstances change.\nTo be useful, the future forecast for financial planning purposes is almost always calculated as monthly\nincrements rather than one total figure for the next 12 months. Breaking the data down by month allows\nfinance managers to more clearly see fluctuations in cash flows in and out, identify potential gaps in cash flow,\nand plan ahead for their cash needs.\nForecasts can also be done for several years into the future. In fact, they commonly are. However, once the\nfirm is looking out beyond 12 months, it gets difficult to forecast items with a great degree of accuracy. Often,\nforecasts beyond a year will be completed only to quarterly or even annual figures rather than monthly.\nForecasts that far into the future are often strategic in nature, made more to communicate future plans for the\nfirm than for more detailed decision-making and cash flow planning.\nCommon-Size Financials\nAs we saw earlier in the chapter, common-size analysis involves using historical financial statements as a basis\nfor future forecasts.

As we saw earlier in the chapter, we begin with forecasted sales because they are\nthe basis for many of the forecasted costs.\nLet’s begin with the sales forecast for Clear Lake Sporting Goods that we saw earlier in the chapter, in Figure\n18.9, and use it along with the prior year income statement by month shown in Figure 18.12. We will consider\nother data we have about the business to begin creating a full income statement (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.12 Prior Year Monthly Income Statement by Month\nThe first two key points regarding product lines have already been built into the sales forecast. Notice that the\ncost of goods sold was 50% in the prior year. However, based on possible future legislation, to be conservative,\nwe should increase the cost of goods sold by 2% in the last quarter of the year. Thus, we will forecast cost of\ngoods sold at 50% of sales in the first nine months and increase it to 52% in the last three months of the year.\nRent is a fixed cost that historically amounts to $458 per month. However, we know that the landlord is\nincreasing rent by $50 starting on July 1. Thus, we will forecast rent at the same fixed cost of $458 per month\nfor the first six months and increase it to $508 per month for the second half of the year.\nDepreciation, also a fixed cost, was historically $300 per month. However, we know that depreciation expense\nwill go down by $25 beginning in April. Thus, we forecast depreciation at $300 for the first three months and at\n$275 for the last 9 months.\nSalaries expense has historically been $450 per month. However, we know that the company is implementing a\nnew compensation program on January 1 that will increase salaries expense by 4% ($18). Thus, we will forecast\nsalaries for the whole year at $468.\nUtilities expense seems to vary somewhat by sales from month to month, as shops are open longer hours\nduring their busy season. However, the total utilities expense is not expected to change for the coming year.\nThus, the forecast for utilities expense remains at $2,500, broken down by month as a percentage of sales.\nInterest expense is a fixed cost and isn’t anticipated to change. Thus, the same $167 interest expense per\nmonth is forecast for the coming year.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n547\nFinally, income tax expense is forecasted as a percentage of operating income because tax liability is incurred\nas a direct result of operating income.

The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales.

Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales.

Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.\nIt’s also common to find other general policies or procedures that help drive performance and aid in\nforecasting balances. For example, if the company has a goal of maintaining a certain level of inventory or a\nminimum balance in its cash account, that information can be used to guide the estimate for those accounts.\n18.4 • Generating the Complete Forecast\n549\n18.5\nForecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nGenerate a cash flow forecast.\n•\nAssess a cash flow forecast to determine future cash funding needs.\n•\nUse pro forma financial statements and cash flow forecasts to assess the value of growth to the firm.\nIn this section of the chapter, we will use the forecasted income statement, forecasted balance sheet, and\nother information we know about the firm’s policies and goals for the coming year to generate and assess a\ncash flow forecast.\nCreate a Cash Flow Forecast\nA cash flow forecast isn’t overly complex, yet it is not easy to assemble because it requires making many\nassumptions about the future. A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).",

Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, in Figure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash\noutflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid\nquarterly.

This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March.

While it certainly can be good\nas a firm to grow in size, growth just for the sake of growth isn’t necessarily a good goal. A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process.

These statements could all have been generated by hand, of course, but that\nwouldn’t be an effective use of time. As mentioned in prior sections, several different types of software can be\nquite effective in making the forecasting process faster and more flexible. In this section, we will review just\none common option, Microsoft Excel.\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file) containing key Chapter 18\nExcel exhibits.\nUsing the “Sheet”\nCreating a budget in Excel can be very simple or extremely complex, depending on the size and complexity of\nthe business and the number of formulas and dependencies that are written into the Excel workbook.\nCreating the forecast in Excel follows the same steps and flow we just explored in this chapter but with the\npower of a software program to do the math for you. We begin with the sales forecast, which uses several key\nformulas in Excel.\n1.\nFirst, sales are projected to be 18% higher than the prior year. Thus, a total projection for the year is\ncalculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales. In Figure 18.19, you\ncan see the formula in cell O4 is “='Figure 18.12'!N4*1.18”. This formula simply does the math to increase\nthe prior year’s sales by 18%.\n2.\nNext, the sales are distributed by month. In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula",

For instance, sales are projected to be a certain percentage higher than the prior year, and this increase is calculated using a simple link and multiplication function tied to last year’s total sales.

Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.\nAs Clear Lake continues to fill out its forecasted income statement, the next formula we see is a simple\nsum formula to calculate net sales in B8 (see Figure 18.20). It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales\nreturns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross\nmargin and B18 for net income.\n4.\nIn cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because\n554\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmanagement feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and\nlast year’s percentage was 50%.\n5.\nRent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as\nlast year.\n6.\nThe utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation.

In Figure 18.21, we see in C7 an addition formula using the sum of the current\nmonth and three months of prior sales as an estimate of the ending accounts receivable balance.

To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.\nFinally, note the formula in C4.

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.",

In that way, Amazon had a\nnegative cash conversion cycle (which is really a huge positive for a company trying to manage positive\ncash flow!).\nWorking Capital Needs by Industry\nWhen comparing working capital needs by industry, you can see some variation. For example, some\ncompanies in the grocery business can have very low cash conversion cycles, while construction companies\ncan have very high cash conversion cycles. And some companies, like those in the restaurant business, can\nhave very low numbers and even have negative cash conversion cycles.\nWorking capital can also differ from one industry to another. An often cited general rule is that a current ratio\nof 2 is considered optimal. However, general rules of thumb must be treated with caution.

In Cost of Trade Credit, there is an example that shows the high annualize opportunity cost (36.73\npercent) of not taking advantage of cash discounts.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nTrade Credit of International Trade\nWhen international trade occurs, two important documents are commonly required: a letter of credit and\na bill of lading. A letter of credit is issued by a financial institution on behalf of the foreign buyer\n(importer). The bill of lading is a legal document that gives proof of a contract between a transportation\ncompany and the buyer and is one important piece of documentation that allows the buyer to draw on the\nletter of credit. A bill of lading serves as a document of title and proof of receipt of goods by the shipper.\nThe letter of credit secures a promise of payment to the seller (exporter) provided that the terms of the sale\nare met. For an international trade transaction, the letter of credit is the main mechanism that establishes a\nliability for the buyer. Instead of a trade payable, the buyer uses a line of credit from a bank.\nCost of Trade Credit\nTrade credit is often referred to as a no-cost type of financing. Unlike with other credit arrangements (e.g.,\nbank loans, lines of credit, and commercial paper), there is usually no interest expense associated with trade\ncredit, and as long as your account does not become delinquent, there are no special fees. Some accounts\npayable arrangements specify an interest penalty or a late fee when the account goes delinquent, but as long\n576\n19 • The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nas payments are made on time, trade credit is thought of as a low-cost source of working capital.\nHowever, there is one possible cost associated with trade credit for companies that don’t take advantage of\ncash discounts when offered by sellers.

Emergencies might require a company to write a check for repairs, for an unexpected breakdown of\nequipment, or for hiring temporary workers. This motive of holding cash is called the precautionary motive.\nSome companies maintain a certain amount of cash instead of investing it in marketable securities or in\nupgrades or expansion of operations. This is called the speculative motive. Companies that want to quickly\ntake advantage of unexpected opportunities want to be quick to purchase assets or to acquire a business, and\na certain amount of cash or quick access to cash is necessary to jump on an opportunity.\n19.3 • Cash Management\n577\nSometimes cash balances may be required by a bank with which a company conducts significant business.\nThese balances are called compensating balances and are typically a minimum amount to be maintained in\nthe company’s checking account.\nFor example, Jack’s Outback Restaurant Group borrowed $500,000 from First National Bank and Trust. As part\nof the loan agreement, First National Bank required Jack’s to keep at least $50,000 in its company checking\naccount as a way of compensating the bank for other corporate services it provides to Jack’s Outback\nRestaurant Group.\nCash Alternatives\nCash that a company has that is in excess of projected financial needs is often invested in short-term\ninvestments, also known as cash equivalents (cash alternatives). The reason for this is that cash does not earn\na rate of return; therefore, too much idle cash can affect the profitability of a business.\nTable 19.3 shows a list of typical investment vehicles used by corporations to earn interest on excess cash.\nFinancial managers search for opportunities that are safe and highly liquid and that will provide a positive rate\nof return. Cash alternatives, because of their short-term maturities, have low interest rate risk (the risk that an\ninvestment’s value will decrease because of changes in market interest rates). In that way, prudent investment\nof excess cash follows the risk/return trade-off; in order to achieve safe returns, the returns will be lower than\nthe possible returns achieved with risky investments.

If\nmost companies in an industry offer a discount for early payments, then most companies will follow suit and\nalso offer an equal discount.\nOnce credit terms are established, they can be changed based on both marketing strategies and financial\nmanagement goals. For example, discounts for early payments can be more generous, or the full credit\nperiod can be extended to stimulate additional sales.

To prepare the aging schedule, a classifying of customer account\nbalances is performed with age as the sorting attribute.\nAn account receivable begins its life as a credit sale. The age of a receivable is the number of days that have\ntranspired since the credit sale was made (the date of the invoice).

In this example (Figure 19.8),\nthe purchases budget shows projected purchases of inventory (merchandise) and the projected payments\n(also called disbursements) for each month.\nCash outflows as a result of purchases often do not equal the projected purchase amount. That is because\npayments for purchases are usually on credit (accounts payable), and so purchases for one month typically get\nspread out over a period of time that encompasses the current month and the month (or months) thereafter.\nTo keep this example simple, the assumption is that the purchases are paid for in the following month (an\naverage days payable outstanding of 30 days).

The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables.

One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk.

Starbucks must then convert these Japanese yen to US dollars to pay the\nexpenses that it incurs in the United States to produce and distribute these products.\nThe Japanese yen–US dollar foreign exchange rates from 2011 through the first quarter of 2021 are shown in\nFigure 20.3.

Starbucks might purchase a coffee plantation in Costa Rica for 120\nmillion Costa Rican colones.

If the Costa Rican colón depreciates to 600\ncolones to the dollar, then the asset has a value of only $200,000 when translated using this exchange rate.\nAlthough it is the same piece of land with the same productive capacity, the value of the asset, as reported on\nthe balance sheet, falls as the Costa Rican colón depreciates. This decrease in the value of the company’s\nassets must be offset by a decrease in the stockholders’ equity for the balance sheet to balance.

The most common kinds of options are American options,\nwhich allow the holder to exercise the option at any time up to and including the expiration date. Holders of\nEuropean options may exercise their options only on the expiration date. The labels American option and\nEuropean option can be confusing as they have nothing to do with the location where the options are traded.\nBoth American and European options are traded worldwide.\nOption contracts are written for a variety of assets. The most common option contracts are options on shares\nof stock. Options are traded for US Treasury securities, currencies, gold, and oil. There are also options on\nagricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, cotton, and orange juice. Thus, options can be used by financial\nmanagers to hedge many types of risk, including currency risk, interest rate risk, and the risk that arises from\nfluctuations in the prices of raw materials.\nOptions are divided into two main categories, call options and put options. A call option gives the owner of\nthe option the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset. A put option gives the owner the\nright, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset.\nCall Options\nIf a Korean company knows that it will need pay a $100,000 bill to a US supplier in six months, it knows how\nmany US dollars it will need to pay the bill. As a Korean company, however, its bank account is denominated in\nKorean won. In six months, it will need to use its Korean won to purchase 100,000 US dollars.\nThe company can determine how many Korean won it would take to purchase $100,000 today. If the current\nexchange rate is\n, then it will need KWN 110,000,000 to pay the bill. The current\nexchange rate is known as the spot rate.\nThe company, however, does not need the US dollars for another six months. The company can purchase a call\noption, which is a contract that will allow it to purchase the needed US dollars in six months at a price stated in\nthe contract. This allows the company to guarantee a price for dollars in six months, but it does not obligate\nthe company to purchase the dollars at that price if it can find a better price when it needs the dollars in six\nmonths.\nThe price that is in the contract is called the strike price (exercise price).

Suppose the company purchases a\ncall contract for US dollars with a strike price of KWN 1,200/USD. While this contract would be for a set size, or\na certain number of US dollars, we will talk about this transaction as if it were per one US dollar to highlight\nhow options contracts work.\n20.3 • Exchange Rates and Risk\n609\nThe company must pay a price, known as the premium, to purchase this call option contract. For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option. In fact, if the\nspot rate is anything below\n, the company will not choose to exercise the option. If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option.

Just as other prices are volatile, interest rates are also\nvolatile. Just as volatility in other prices leads to uncertain cash flows for a company, volatility in interest rates\ncan also lead to uncertain cash flows.\nMeasuring Interest Rate Risk\nSuppose that a company is supposed to pay a bill of $1,000 in 10 years. The present value of this bill depends\non the level of interest rates. If the interest rate is 5%, the present value of the bill is\n. If\nthe interest rate rises to 6%, the present value of the bill is\n. The increase in the interest\nrate by 1% causes the present value of the expected cash flow to fall by\n.\nInterest rate risk can be highlighted by looking at bonds. Consider two $1,000 face value bonds with a 5%\ncoupon rate, paid semiannually. One of the bonds matures in five years, and the other bond matures in 30\nyears. If the market interest rate is 5%, each of these bonds will sell for face value, or $1,000. If, instead, the\nmarket interest rate is 6%, the five-year bond will sell for $957.35 and the 30-year bond will sell for $861.62.\nNotice that as the interest rate rises, the price of both of these bonds will fall. However, the price of the longer-\nterm bond will fall by more than the price of the shorter-term bond. The longer-term bond price will fall by\n1.38%; the shorter-term bond price will fall by only 0.43%.\nConsider two additional $1,000 face value bonds. The difference is that these bonds have a 6% coupon rate,\npaid semiannually. If a bond has a 6% coupon rate and matures in five years, it will sell for $1,043.76 when the\nmarket interest rate is 5%.

The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5\nTable 20.5 Example of a Swap Agreement\n616\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAlpha\nBeta\nAlpha pays Beta floating rate\n-LIBOR\n+LIBOR\nPayments and receipts\nNet amount\n-6.25\nBenefit\n0.75\n0.5\nTable 20.5 Example of a Swap Agreement",
