This book engages students by relating law to everyday events with which they \nare already familiar (or with which they are familiarizing themselves in other business courses) and \nby its clear, concise, and readable style. (An earlier business law text by authors Lieberman and \nSiedel was hailed “the best written text in a very crowded field.”) \n \nThis textbook provides context and essential concepts across the entire range of legal issues with \nwhich managers and business executives must grapple. The text provides the vocabulary and legal \nacumen necessary for businesspeople to talk in an educated way to their customers, employees, \nsuppliers, government officials—and to their own lawyers. \n \nTraditional publishers often create confusion among customers in the text selection process by \noffering a huge array of publications. Once a text is selected, customers might still have to customize \nthe text to meet their needs. For example, publishers usually offer books that include either case \nsummaries or excerpted cases, but some instructors prefer to combine case summaries with a few \nexcerpted cases so that students can experience reading original material. Likewise, the manner in \nwhich most conventional texts incorporate video is cumbersome because the videos are contained in \na separate library, which makes access more complicating for instructors and students. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n3 \nChapter 1 \nIntroduction to Law and Legal Systems \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \nAfter reading this chapter, you should be able to do the following: \n1. Distinguish different philosophies of law—schools of legal thought—and explain their relevance. \n2. Identify the various aims that a functioning legal system can serve. \n3. Explain how politics and law are related. \n4. Identify the sources of law and which laws have priority over other laws. \n5. Understand some basic differences between the US legal system and other legal systems. \n \n \nLaw has different meanings as well as different functions. Philosophers have considered issues of \njustice and law for centuries, and several different approaches, or schools of legal thought, have \nemerged. In this chapter, we will look at those different meanings and approaches and will consider \nhow social and political dynamics interact with the ideas that animate the various schools of legal \nthought. We will also look at typical sources of “positive law” in the United States and how some of \nthose sources have priority over others, and we will set out some basic differences between the US \nlegal system and other legal systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.1 What Is Law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n4 \n \nLaw is a word that means different things at different times. Black’s Law Dictionary says that law is “a \nbody of rules of action or conduct prescribed by controlling authority, and having binding legal force. That \nwhich must be obeyed and followed by citizens subject to sanctions or legal consequence is a law.” [1] \n \nFunctions of the Law \nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual \nrights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly \nsocial change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an \nauthoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities \nor political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, \nEuropean nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by \nthose same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by \nSpain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of \nthe law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and \nseldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation. \n \nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have \nfrequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, \npower struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the \ndeliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the",

            "chunk": "to be altered or modernized in order to remain current. The social context of law was more important to \nlegal realists than the formal application of precedent to current or future legal disputes. Rather than \nsuppose that judges inevitably acted objectively in applying an existing rule to a set of facts, legal realists \nobserved that judges had their own beliefs, operated in a social context, and would give legal decisions \nbased on their beliefs and their own social context. \n \nThe legal realist view influenced the emergence of the critical legal studies (CLS) school of thought. The \n“Crits” believe that the social order (and the law) is dominated by those with power, wealth, and influence. \nSome Crits are clearly influenced by the economist Karl Marx and also by distributive justice theory \n(see Chapter 2 \"Corporate Social Responsibility and Business Ethics\"). The CLS school believes the \nwealthy have historically oppressed or exploited those with less wealth and have maintained social control \nthrough law. In so doing, the wealthy have perpetuated an unjust distribution of both rights and goods in \nsociety. Law is politics and is thus not neutral or value-free. The CLS movement would use the law to \noverturn the hierarchical structures of domination in the modern society. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n11 \nRelated to the CLS school, yet different, is the ecofeminist school of legal thought. This school \nemphasizes—and would modify—the long-standing domination of men over both women and the rest of \nthe natural world. Ecofeminists would say that the same social mentality that leads to exploitation of \nwomen is at the root of man’s exploitation and degradation of the natural environment. They would say \nthat male ownership of land has led to a “dominator culture,” in which man is not so much a steward of \nthe existing environment or those “subordinate” to him but is charged with making all that he controls \neconomically “productive.” Wives, children, land, and animals are valued as economic resources, and legal \nsystems (until the nineteenth century) largely conferred rights only to men with land. Ecofeminists would \nsay that even with increasing civil and political rights for women (such as the right to vote) and with some \nnations’ recognizing the rights of children and animals and caring for the environment, the legacy of the \npast for most nations still confirms the preeminence of “man” and his dominance of both nature and \nwomen. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nEach of the various schools of legal thought has a particular view of what a legal system is or what it should \nbe. The natural-law theorists emphasize the rights and duties of both government and the governed. Positive \nlaw takes as a given that law is simply the command of a sovereign, the political power that those governed \nwill obey. Recent writings in the various legal schools of thought emphasize long-standing patterns of \ndomination of the wealthy over others (the CLS school) and of men over women (ecofeminist legal theory). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Vandana Shiva draws a picture of a stream in a forest. She says that in our society the stream is seen as \nunproductive if it is simply there, fulfilling the need for water of women’s families and communities, until \nengineers come along and tinker with it, perhaps damming it and using it for generating hydropower. The \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n12 \nsame is true of a forest, unless it is replaced with a monoculture plantation of a commercial species. A \nforest may very well be productive—protecting groundwater; creating oxygen; providing fruit, fuel, and \ncraft materials for nearby inhabitants; and creating a habitat for animals that are also a valuable resource. \nShe criticizes the view that if there is no monetary amount that can contribute to gross domestic product, \nneither the forest nor the river can be seen as a productive resource. Which school of legal thought does \nher criticism reflect? \n2. Anatole France said, “The law, in its majesty, forbids rich and poor alike from sleeping under bridges.” \nWhich school of legal thought is represented by this quote? \n3. Adolf Eichmann was a loyal member of the National Socialist Party in the Third Reich and worked hard \nunder Hitler’s government during World War II to round up Jewish people for incarceration—and eventual \nextermination—at labor camps like Auschwitz and Buchenwald. After an Israeli “extraction team” took him \nfrom Argentina to Israel, he was put on trial for “crimes against humanity.” His defense was that he was \n“just following orders.” Explain why Eichmann was not an adherent of the natural-law school of legal \nthought. \n \n  \n \n[1] Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, s.v. “natural law.” \n[2] Martin Luther King Jr., “Letter from Birmingham Jail.” \n \n \n \n1.3 Basic Concepts and Categories of US Positive Law \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

If the government appears first in the caption of the case (e.g., U.S. v. \nLieberman, it is likely that the United States is prosecuting on behalf of the people. The same is true of \ncases prosecuted by state district attorneys (e.g., State v. Seidel). But this is not a foolproof formula. \nGovernments will also bring civil actions to collect debts from or settle disputes with individuals, \ncorporations, or other governments. Thus U.S. v. Mayer might be a collection action for unpaid taxes, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n17 \nor U.S. v. Canada might be a boundary dispute in the International Court of Justice. Governments can be \nsued, as well; people occasionally sue their state or federal government, but they can only get a trial if the \ngovernment waives its sovereign immunity and allows such suits. Warner v. U.S., for example, could be a \nclaim for a tax refund wrongfully withheld or for damage caused to the Warner residence by a sonic boom \nfrom a US Air Force jet flying overhead. \n \nSubstance versus Procedure \nMany rules and regulations in law are substantive, and others are procedural. We are used to seeing laws \nas substantive; that is, there is some rule of conduct or behavior that is called for or some action that is \nproscribed (prohibited). The substantive rules tell us how to act with one another and with the \ngovernment. For example, all of the following are substantive rules of law and provide a kind of command \nor direction to citizens: \n \n• \nDrive not more than fifty-five miles per hour where that speed limit is posted. \n• \nDo not conspire to fix prices with competitors in the US market. \n• \nDo not falsely represent the curative effects of your over-the-counter herbal remedy. \n• \nDo not drive your motor vehicle through an intersection while a red traffic signal faces the \ndirection you are coming from. \n• \nDo not discriminate against job applicants or employees on the basis of their race, sex, religion, or \nnational origin. \n• \nDo not discharge certain pollutants into the river without first getting a discharge permit. \n \nIn contrast, procedural laws are the rules of courts and administrative agencies. They tell us how to \nproceed if there is a substantive-law problem. For example, if you drive fifty-three miles per hour in a \nforty mile-per-hour zone on Main Street on a Saturday night and get a ticket, you have broken a \nsubstantive rule of law (the posted speed limit). Just how and what gets decided in court is a matter of \nprocedural law. Is the police officer’s word final, or do you get your say before a judge? If so, who goes \nfirst, you or the officer? Do you have the right to be represented by legal counsel? Does the hearing or trial \nhave to take place within a certain time period? A week? A month? How long can the state take to bring its \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n18 \ncase? What kinds of evidence will be relevant? Radar? (Does it matter what kind of training the officer has \nhad on the radar device? Whether the radar device had been tested adequately?) The officer’s personal \nobservation? (What kind of training has he had, how is he qualified to judge the speed of a car, and other \nquestions arise.) What if you unwisely bragged to a friend at a party recently that you went a hundred \nmiles an hour on Main Street five years ago at half past three on a Tuesday morning? (If the prosecutor \nknows of this and the “friend” is willing to testify, is it relevant to the charge of fifty-three in a forty-mile-\nper-hour zone?) \nIn the United States, all state procedural laws must be fair, since the due process clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment directs that no state shall deprive any citizen of “life, liberty, or property,” without due \nprocess of law. (The $200 fine plus court costs is designed to deprive you of property, that is, money, if \nyou violate the speed limit.) Federal laws must also be fair, because the Fifth Amendment to the US \nConstitution has the exact same due process language as the Fourteenth Amendment. This suggests that \nsome laws are more powerful or important than others, which is true. The next section looks at various \ntypes of positive law and their relative importance. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nIn most legal systems, like that in the United States, there is a fairly firm distinction between criminal law (for \nactions that are offenses against the entire society) and civil law (usually for disputes between individuals or \ncorporations).

Describe the different sources of law in the US legal system and the principal institutions that create those \nlaws. \n2. Explain in what way a statute is like a treaty, and vice versa. \n3. Explain why the Constitution is “prior” and has priority over the legislative acts of a majority, whether in the \nUS Congress or in a state legislature. \n4. Describe the origins of the common-law system and what common law means. \n \n \nSources of Law \nIn the United States today, there are numerous sources of law. The main ones are (1) constitutions—both \nstate and federal, (2) statutes and agency regulations, and (3) judicial decisions. In addition, chief \nexecutives (the president and the various governors) can issue executive orders that have the effect of law. \n \nIn international legal systems, sources of law include treaties (agreements between states or countries) \nand what is known as customary international law (usually consisting of judicial decisions from national \ncourt systems where parties from two or more nations are in a dispute). \n \nAs you might expect, these laws sometimes conflict: a state law may conflict with a federal law, or a \nfederal law might be contrary to an international obligation. One nation’s law may provide one \nsubstantive rule, while another nation’s law may provide a different, somewhat contrary rule to apply. Not \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n20 \nall laws, in other words, are created equal. To understand which laws have priority, it is essential to \nunderstand the relationships between the various kinds of law. \n \n \nConstitutions \nConstitutions are the foundation for a state or nation’s other laws, providing the country’s legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial framework. Among the nations of the world, the United States has the oldest \nconstitution still in use. It is difficult to amend, which is why there have only been seventeen amendments \nfollowing the first ten in 1789; two-thirds of the House and Senate must pass amendments, and three-\nfourths of the states must approve them. \n \nThe nation’s states also have constitutions. Along with providing for legislative, executive, and judicial \nfunctions, state constitutions prescribe various rights of citizens. These rights may be different from, and \nin addition to, rights granted by the US Constitution. Like statutes and judicial decisions, a constitution’s \nspecific provisions can provide people with a “cause of action” on which to base a lawsuit (see Section \n1.4.3 \"Causes of Action, Precedent, and \" on “causes of action”). For example, California’s constitution \nprovides that the citizens of that state have a right of privacy. This has been used to assert claims against \nbusinesses that invade an employee’s right of privacy. In the case of Virginia Rulon-Miller, her employer, \nInternational Business Machines (IBM), told her to stop dating a former colleague who went to work for a \ncompetitor. When she refused, IBM terminated her, and a jury fined the company for $300,000 in \ndamages. As the California court noted, “While an employee sacrifices some privacy rights when he enters \nthe workplace, the employee’s privacy expectations must be balanced against the employer’s \ninterests.…[T]he point here is that privacy, like the other unalienable rights listed first in our \nConstitution…is unquestionably a fundamental interest of our society.” [1] \n \nStatutes and Treaties in Congress \nIn Washington, DC, the federal legislature is known as Congress and has both a House of Representatives",

The House is composed of representatives elected every two years from various districts in \neach state. These districts are established by Congress according to population as determined every ten \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n21 \nyears by the census, a process required by the Constitution. Each state has at least one district; the most \npopulous state (California) has fifty-two districts. In the Senate, there are two senators from each state, \nregardless of the state’s population. Thus Delaware has two senators and California has two senators, even \nthough California has far more people. Effectively, less than 20 percent of the nation’s population can \nsend fifty senators to Washington. \n \nMany consider this to be antidemocratic. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, is directly \nproportioned by population, though no state can have less than one representative. \n \nEach Congressional legislative body has committees for various purposes. In these committees, proposed \nbills are discussed, hearings are sometimes held, and bills are either reported out (brought to the floor for \na vote) or killed in committee. If a bill is reported out, it may be passed by majority vote. Because of the \nprocedural differences between the House and the Senate, bills that have the same language when \nproposed in both houses are apt to be different after approval by each body. A conference committee will \nthen be held to try to match the two versions. If the two versions differ widely enough, reconciliation of \nthe two differing versions into one acceptable to both chambers (House and Senate) is more difficult. \n \nIf the House and Senate can agree on identical language, the reconciled bill will be sent to the president \nfor signature or veto. The Constitution prescribes that the president will have veto power over any \nlegislation. But the two bodies can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in each chamber. \n \nIn the case of treaties, the Constitution specifies that only the Senate must ratify them. When the Senate \nratifies a treaty, it becomes part of federal law, with the same weight and effect as a statute passed by the \nentire Congress. The statutes of Congress are collected in codified form in the US Code. The code is \navailable online at http://uscode.house.gov. \n \nDelegating Legislative Powers: Rules by Administrative Agencies \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n22 \nCongress has found it necessary and useful to create government agencies to administer various laws \n(see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). The Constitution does not expressly provide for administrative \nagencies, but the US Supreme Court has upheld the delegation of power to create federal agencies. \n \nExamples of administrative agencies would include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). \n \nIt is important to note that Congress does not have unlimited authority to delegate its lawmaking powers \nto an agency. It must delegate its authority with some guidelines for the agency and cannot altogether \navoid its constitutional responsibilities (see Chapter 5 \"Administrative Law\"). \n \nAgencies propose rules in the Federal Register, published each working day of the year. Rules that are \nformally adopted are published in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR, available online \nathttp://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/cfr-table-search.html. \n \nState Statutes and Agencies: Other Codified Law \nStatutes are passed by legislatures and provide general rules for society. States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes,",

States have legislatures \n(sometimes called assemblies), which are usually made up of both a senate and a house of representatives. \nLike the federal government, state legislatures will agree on the provisions of a bill, which is then sent to \nthe governor (acting like the president for that state) for signature. Like the president, governors often \nhave a veto power. The process of creating and amending, or changing, laws is filled with political \nnegotiation and compromise. \n \nOn a more local level, counties and municipal corporations or townships may be authorized under a \nstate’s constitution to create or adopt ordinances. Examples of ordinances include local building codes, \nzoning laws, and misdemeanors or infractions such as skateboarding or jaywalking. Most of the more \nunusual laws that are in the news from time to time are local ordinances. For example, in Logan County, \nColorado, it is illegal to kiss a sleeping woman; in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Eureka, Nebraska, it is a \ncrime to kiss if you have a mustache. But reportedly, some states still have odd laws here and there. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n23 \nKentucky law proclaims that every person in the state must take a bath at least once a year, and failure to \ndo so is illegal. \n \nJudicial Decisions: The Common Law \nCommon law consists of decisions by courts (judicial decisions) that do not involve interpretation of \nstatutes, regulations, treaties, or the Constitution. Courts make such interpretations, but many cases are \ndecided where there is no statutory or other codified law or regulation to be interpreted. For example, a \nstate court deciding what kinds of witnesses are required for a valid will in the absence of a rule (from a \nstatute) is making common law. \n \nUnited States law comes primarily from the tradition of English common law. By the time England’s \nAmerican colonies revolted in 1776, English common-law traditions were well established in the colonial \ncourts. English common law was a system that gave written judicial decisions the force of law throughout \nthe country. Thus if an English court delivered an opinion as to what constituted the common-law crime \nof burglary, other courts would stick to that decision, so that a common body of law developed throughout \nthe country. Common law is essentially shorthand for the notion that a common body of law, based on \npast written decisions, is desirable and necessary. \n \nIn England and in the laws of the original thirteen states, common-law decisions defined crimes such as \narson, burglary, homicide, and robbery. As time went on, US state legislatures either adopted or modified \ncommon-law definitions of most crimes by putting them in the form of codes or statutes. This legislative \nability—to modify or change common law into judicial law—points to an important phenomenon: the \npriority of statutory law over common law. As we will see in the next section, constitutional law will have \npriority over statutory law. \n \n \n \n \nPriority of Laws \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n24 \nThe Constitution as Preemptive Force in US Law \nThe US Constitution takes precedence over all statutes and judicial decisions that are inconsistent. For \nexample, if Michigan were to decide legislatively that students cannot speak ill of professors in state-\nsponsored universities, that law would be void, since it is inconsistent with the state’s obligation under the \nFirst Amendment to protect free speech. Or if the Michigan courts were to allow a professor to bring a \nlawsuit against a student who had said something about him that was derogatory but not defamatory, the \nstate’s judicial system would not be acting according to the First Amendment. (As we will see in Chapter 7 \n\"Introduction to Tort Law\", free speech has its limits; defamation was a cause of action at the time the \nFirst Amendment was added to the Constitution, and it has been understood that the free speech rights in \nthe First Amendment did not negate existing common law.) \n \nStatutes and Cases \nStatutes generally have priority, or take precedence, over case law (judicial decisions). Under common-\nlaw judicial decisions, employers could hire young children for difficult work, offer any wage they wanted, \nand not pay overtime work at a higher rate. But various statutes changed that. For example, the federal \nFair Labor Standards Act (1938) forbid the use of oppressive child labor and established a minimum pay \nwage and overtime pay rules. \n \nTreaties as Statutes: The “Last in Time” Rule \nA treaty or convention is considered of equal standing to a statute. Thus when Congress ratified the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), any judicial decisions or previous statutes that were \ninconsistent—such as quotas or limitations on imports from Mexico that were opposite to NAFTA \ncommitments—would no longer be valid. Similarly, US treaty obligations under the General Agreement",

Describe how the common-law system differs from the civil-law system. \n \n \nOther legal and political systems are very different from the US system, which came from English \ncommon-law traditions and the framers of the US Constitution. Our legal and political traditions are \ndifferent both in what kinds of laws we make and honor and in how disputes are resolved in court. \n \nComparing Common-Law Systems with Other Legal Systems \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n30 \nThe common-law tradition is unique to England, the United States, and former colonies of the British \nEmpire. Although there are differences among common-law systems (e.g., most nations do not permit \ntheir judiciaries to declare legislative acts unconstitutional; some nations use the jury less frequently), all \nof them recognize the use of precedent in judicial cases, and none of them relies on the comprehensive, \nlegislative codes that are prevalent in civil-law systems. \n \nCivil-Law Systems \nThe main alternative to the common-law legal system was developed in Europe and is based in Roman \nand Napoleonic law. A civil-law or code-law system is one where all the legal rules are in one or more \ncomprehensive legislative enactments. During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws—a code—\nwas developed for all of France. The code covered criminal law, criminal procedure, noncriminal law and \nprocedure, and commercial law. The rules of the code are still used today in France and in other \ncontinental European legal systems. The code is used to resolve particular cases, usually by judges without \na jury. Moreover, the judges are not required to follow the decisions of other courts in similar cases. As \nGeorge Cameron of the University of Michigan has noted, “The law is in the code, not in the cases.” He \ngoes on to note, “Where several cases all have interpreted a provision in a particular way, the French",

Civil-law systems decide cases without a jury, \noften use three judges, and often render shorter opinions without reference to previously decided cases. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Use the Internet to identify some of the better-known nations with civil-law systems. Which Asian nations \ncame to adopt all or part of civil-law traditions, and why? \n1.6 A Sample Case \n \nPreliminary Note to Students \n \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute that applies to all employers whose \nworkforce exceeds fifteen people. The text of Title VII says that \n \n(a) it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer— \n \n(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against \nany individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, \nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or natural origin. \n \nAt common law—where judges decide cases without reference to statutory guidance—employers \nwere generally free to hire and fire on any basis they might choose, and employees were generally \nfree to work for an employer or quit an employer on any basis they might choose (unless the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n32 \nemployer and the employee had a contract). This rule has been called “employment at will.” State \nand federal statutes that prohibit discrimination on any basis (such as the prohibitions on \ndiscrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in Title VII) are essentially \nlegislative exceptions to the common-law employment-at-will rule. \n \nIn the 1970s, many female employees began to claim a certain kind of sex discrimination: sexual \nharassment. Some women were being asked to give sexual favors in exchange for continued \nemployment or promotion (quid pro quo sexual harassment) or found themselves in a working \nenvironment that put their chances for continued employment or promotion at risk. This form of \nsexual discrimination came to be called “hostile working environment” sexual harassment. \nNotice that the statute itself says nothing about sexual harassment but speaks only in broad terms \nabout discrimination “because of” sex (and four other factors). Having set the broad policy, Congress \nleft it to employees, employers, and the courts to fashion more specific rules through the process of \ncivil litigation. \n \nThis is a case from our federal court system, which has a trial or hearing in the federal district court, \nan appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a final appeal to the US Supreme Court. Teresa \nHarris, having lost at both the district court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, here has \npetitioned for a writ of certiorari (asking the court to issue an order to bring the case to the Supreme",

            "chunk": "plaintiff’s psychological well-being” or led her to “suffer injury.” Such an inquiry may needlessly \nfocus the fact finder’s attention on concrete psychological harm, an element Title VII does not \nrequire. Certainly Title VII bars conduct that would seriously affect a reasonable person’s \npsychological well-being, but the statute is not limited to such conduct. So long as the environment \nwould reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive, Meritor, supra, at 67, there is \nno need for it also to be psychologically injurious. \n \nThis is not, and by its nature cannot be, a mathematically precise test. We need not answer today all \nthe potential questions it raises, nor specifically address the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission’s new regulations on this subject, see 58 Fed. Reg. 51266 (1993) (proposed 29 CFR §§ \n1609.1, 1609.2); see also 29 CFR § 1604.11 (1993). But we can say that whether an environment is \n“hostile” or “abusive” can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances. These may include \nthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or \nhumiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an \nemployee’s work performance. The effect on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course, \nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive. But while \npsychological harm, like any other relevant factor, may be taken into account, no single factor is \nrequired. \n \nIII \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n37 \nForklift, while conceding that a requirement that the conduct seriously affect psychological well-\nbeing is unfounded, argues that the District Court nonetheless correctly applied the Meritor \nstandard. We disagree. Though the District Court did conclude that the work environment was not \n“intimidating or abusive to [Harris],” it did so only after finding that the conduct was not “so severe \nas to be expected to seriously affect plaintiff’s psychological well-being,” and that Harris was not \n“subjectively so offended that she suffered injury,” ibid. The District Court’s application of these \nincorrect standards may well have influenced its ultimate conclusion, especially given that the court \nfound this to be a “close case.” \n \nWe therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \n \nSo ordered. \n \nNote to Students \n \nThis was only the second time that the Supreme Court had decided a sexual harassment case. Many \nfeminist legal studies scholars feared that the court would raise the bar and make hostile-working-\nenvironment claims under Title VII more difficult to win. That did not happen. When the question to be \ndecided is combined with the court’s decision, we get the holding of the case. Here, the question that the \ncourt poses, plus its answer, yields a holding that “An employee need not prove severe psychological \ninjury in order to win a Title VII sexual harassment claim.” This holding will be true until such time as the \ncourt revisits a similar question and answers it differently. This does happen, but happens rarely. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Is this a criminal case or a civil-law case? How can you tell? \n2. Is the court concerned with making a procedural rule here, or is the court making a statement about the \nsubstantive law? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n38 \n3. Is this a case where the court is interpreting the Constitution, a federal statute, a state statute, or the \ncommon law? \n4. In Harris v. Forklift, what if the trial judge does not personally agree that women should have any rights to \nequal treatment in the workplace? Why shouldn’t that judge dismiss the case even before trial? Or should \nthe judge dismiss the case after giving the female plaintiff her day in court? \n5. What was the employer’s argument in this case? Do you agree or disagree with it? What if those who \nlegislated Title VII gave no thought to the question of seriousness of injury at all? \n \n \n \n \n1.7 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nThere are differing conceptions of what law is and of what law should be. Laws and legal systems differ \nworldwide. The legal system in the United States is founded on the US Constitution, which is itself \ninspired by natural-law theory and the idea that people have rights that cannot be taken by government \nbut only protected by government. The various functions of the law are done well or poorly depending on \nwhich nation-state you look at. Some do very well in terms of keeping order, while others do a better job \nof allowing civil and political freedoms. Social and political movements within each nation greatly affect \nthe nature and quality of the legal system within that nation. \n \nThis chapter has familiarized you with a few of the basic schools of legal thought, such as natural law, \npositive law, legal realism, and critical legal studies.

Define ethics and explain the importance of good ethics for business people and business \norganizations. \n2. Understand the principal philosophies of ethics, including utilitarianism, duty-based ethics, and virtue \nethics. \n3. Distinguish between the ethical merits of various choices by using an ethical decision model. \n4. Explain the difference between shareholder and stakeholder models of ethical corporate governance. \n5. Explain why it is difficult to establish and maintain an ethical corporate culture in a business \norganization. \n \n \nFew subjects are more contentious or important as the role of business in society, particularly, \nwhether corporations have social responsibilities that are distinct from maximizing shareholder \nvalue. While the phrase “business ethics” is not oxymoronic (i.e., a contradiction in terms), there is \nplenty of evidence that businesspeople and firms seek to look out primarily for themselves. However, \nbusiness organizations ignore the ethical and social expectations of consumers, employees, the \nmedia, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government officials, and socially responsible \ninvestors at their peril. Legal compliance alone no longer serves the long-term interests of many \ncompanies, who find that sustainable profitability requires thinking about people and the planet as \nwell as profits. \n \nThis chapter has a fairly modest aim: to introduce potential businesspeople to the differences \nbetween legal compliance and ethical excellence by reviewing some of the philosophical perspectives \nthat apply to business, businesspeople, and the role of business organizations in society. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n43 \n \n \n \n2.1 What Is Ethics? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain how both individuals and institutions can be viewed as ethical or unethical. \n2. Explain how law and ethics are different, and why a good reputation can be more important than legal \ncompliance. \n \n \nMost of those who write about ethics do not make a clear distinction between ethics and morality. \nThe question of what is “right” or “morally correct” or “ethically correct” or “morally desirable” in \nany situation is variously phrased, but all of the words and phrases are after the same thing: what act \nis “better” in a moral or ethical sense than some other act?  \nPeople sometimes speak of morality as something personal but view ethics as having wider social \nimplications. Others see morality as the subject of a field of study, that field being ethics. Ethics \nwould be morality as applied to any number of subjects, including journalistic ethics, business ethics, \nor the ethics of professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and accountants. We will venture a \ndefinition of ethics, but for our purposes, ethics and morality will be used as equivalent terms. \nPeople often speak about the ethics or morality of individuals and also about the morality or ethics of \ncorporations and nations. There are clearly differences in the kind of moral responsibility that we can \nfairly ascribe to corporations and nations; we tend to see individuals as having a soul, or at least a \nconscience, but there is no general agreement that nations or corporations have either. Still, our \nordinary use of language does point to something significant: if we say that some nations are “evil” \nand others are “corrupt,” then we make moral judgments about the quality of actions undertaken by \nthe governments or people of that nation. For example, if North Korea is characterized by the US \npresident as part of an “axis of evil,” or if we conclude that WorldCom or Enron acted “unethically” in \ncertain respects, then we are making judgments that their collective actions are morally deficient. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n44 \n \nIn talking about morality, we often use the word good; but that word can be confusing. If we say that \nMicrosoft is a “good company,” we may be making a statement about the investment potential of \nMicrosoft stock, or their preeminence in the market, or their ability to win lawsuits or appeals or to \ninfluence administrative agencies. Less likely, though possibly, we may be making a statement about \nthe civic virtue and corporate social responsibility of Microsoft. In the first set of judgments, we use \nthe word good but mean something other than ethical or moral; only in the second instance are we \nusing the word good in its ethical or moral sense. \n \nA word such as good can embrace ethical or moral values but also nonethical values.

Even before the conviction, many clients had found other accounting firms that \nwere not under suspicion, and the Supreme Court’s reversal came too late to save the company. Even \nwithout the conviction, Andersen would have lost significant market share. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n48 \nThe irony of Andersen as a poster child for overly aggressive accounting practices is that the man who \nfounded the firm built it on integrity and straightforward practices. “Think straight, talk straight” was the \ncompany’s motto. Andersen established the company’s reputation for integrity over a hundred years ago \nby refusing to play numbers games for a potentially lucrative client. \nMaximizing profits while being legally compliant is not a very inspiring goal for a business. People in an \norganization need some quality or excellence to strive for. By focusing on pushing the edge of what is \nlegal, by looking for loopholes in the law that would help create short-term financial gain, companies have \noften learned that in the long term they are not actually satisfying the market, the shareholders, the \nsuppliers, or the community generally. \n \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nLegal compliance is not the same as acting ethically. Your reputation, individually or corporately, depends on \nhow others regard your actions. Goodwill is hard to measure or quantify, but it is real nonetheless and can \nbest be protected by acting ethically. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Describe the various major theories about ethics in human decision making. \n2. Begin considering how the major theories about ethics apply to difficult choices in life and business. \n \n \nThere are several well-respected ways of looking at ethical issues. Some of them have been around for \ncenturies. It is important to know that many who think a lot about business and ethics have deeply held \nbeliefs about which perspective is best. Others would recommend considering ethical problems from a \nvariety of different perspectives. Here, we take a brief look at (1) utilitarianism, (2) deontology, (3) social \njustice and social contract theory, and (4) virtue theory. We are leaving out some important perspectives, \nsuch as general theories of justice and “rights” and feminist thought about ethics and patriarchy. \n \nUtilitarianism \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n50 \nUtilitarianism is a prominent perspective on ethics, one that is well aligned with economics and the \nfree-market outlook that has come to dominate much current thinking about business, management, and \neconomics. Jeremy Bentham is often considered the founder of utilitarianism, though John Stuart Mill \n(who wrote On Liberty and Utilitarianism) and others promoted it as a guide to what is good. \nUtilitarianism emphasizes not rules but results. An action (or set of actions) is generally deemed good or \nright if it maximizes happiness or pleasure throughout society. Originally intended as a guide for \nlegislators charged with seeking the greatest good for society, the utilitarian outlook may also be practiced \nindividually and by corporations. \n \nBentham believed that the most promising way to obtain agreement on the best policies for a society \nwould be to look at the various policies a legislature could pass and compare the good and bad \nconsequences of each.

The right course of action from an ethical point of view would be to choose the \npolicy that would produce the greatest amount of utility, or usefulness. In brief, the utilitarian principle \nholds that an action is right if and only if the sum of utilities produced by that action is greater than the \nsum of utilities from any other possible act. \n \nThis statement describes “act utilitarianism”—which action among various options will deliver the \ngreatest good to society? “Rule utilitarianism” is a slightly different version; it asks, what rule or principle, \nif followed regularly, will create the greatest good? \n \nNotice that the emphasis is on finding the best possible results and that the assumption is that we can \nmeasure the utilities involved. (This turns out to be more difficult that you might think.) Notice also that \n“the sum total of utilities” clearly implies that in doing utilitarian analysis, we cannot be satisfied if an act \nor set of acts provides the greatest utility to us as individuals or to a particular corporation; the test is, \ninstead, whether it provides the greatest utility to society as a whole. Notice that the theory does not tell us \nwhat kinds of utilities may be better than others or how much better a good today is compared with a \ngood a year from today. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n51 \nWhatever its difficulties, utilitarian thinking is alive and well in US law and business. It is found in such \ndiverse places as cost-benefit analysis in administrative and regulatory rules and calculations, \nenvironmental impact studies, the majority vote, product comparisons for consumer information, \nmarketing studies, tax laws, and strategic planning. In management, people will often employ a form of \nutility reasoning by projecting costs and benefits for plan X versus plan Y. But the issue in most of these \ncost-benefit analyses is usually (1) put exclusively in terms of money and (2) directed to the benefit of the \nperson or organization doing the analysis and not to the benefit of society as a whole. \n \nAn individual or a company that consistently uses the test “What’s the greatest good for me or the \ncompany?” is not following the utilitarian test of the greatest good overall. Another common failing is to \nsee only one or two options that seem reasonable. The following are some frequent mistakes that people \nmake in applying what they think are utilitarian principles in justifying their chosen course of action: \n \n1. Failing to come up with lots of options that seem reasonable and then choosing the one that has the \ngreatest benefit for the greatest number. Often, a decision maker seizes on one or two alternatives \nwithout thinking carefully about other courses of action. If the alternative does more good than \nharm, the decision maker assumes it’s ethically okay. \n2. Assuming that the greatest good for you or your company is in fact the greatest good for all—that is, \nlooking at situations subjectively or with your own interests primarily in mind. \n3. Underestimating the costs of a certain decision to you or your company. The now-classic Ford Pinto \ncase demonstrates how Ford Motor Company executives drastically underestimated the legal costs \nof not correcting a feature on their Pinto models that they knew could cause death or injury. \nGeneral Motors was often taken to task by juries that came to understand that the company would \nnot recall or repair known and dangerous defects because it seemed more profitable not to. In \n2010, Toyota learned the same lesson. \n4. Underestimating the cost or harm of a certain decision to someone else or some other group of \npeople. \n5. Favoring short-term benefits, even though the long-term costs are greater. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n52 \n6. Assuming that all values can be reduced to money. In comparing the risks to human health or \nsafety against, say, the risks of job or profit losses, cost-benefit analyses will often try to compare \napples to oranges and put arbitrary numerical values on human health and safety. \n \nRules and Duty: Deontology \nIn contrast to the utilitarian perspective, the deontological view presented in the writings of Immanuel \nKant purports that having a moral intent and following the right rules is a better path to ethical conduct",

Marxist thought emphasizes that members of society should be given goods to \naccording to their needs. But this redistribution would require a governing power to decide who gets what \nand when. Capitalist thought takes a different approach, rejecting any giving that is not voluntary. Certain \neconomists, such as the late Milton Friedman (see the sidebar in Section 2.4 \"Corporations and Corporate \nGovernance\") also reject the notion that a corporation has a duty to give to unmet needs in society, \nbelieving that the government should play that role. Even the most dedicated free-market capitalist will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n54 \noften admit the need for some government and some forms of welfare—Social Security, Medicare, \nassistance to flood-stricken areas, help for AIDs patients—along with some public goods (such as defense, \neducation, highways, parks, and support of key industries affecting national security). \n \nPeople who do not see the need for public goods (including laws, court systems, and the government \ngoods and services just cited) often question why there needs to be a government at all. One response \nmight be, “Without government, there would be no corporations.” Thomas Hobbes believed that people in \na “state of nature” would rationally choose to have some form of government. He called this \nthe social contract, where people give up certain rights to government in exchange for security and \ncommon benefits. In your own lives and in this course, you will see an ongoing balancing act between \nhuman desires for freedom and human desires for order; it is an ancient tension. Some commentators \nalso see a kind of social contract between corporations and society; in exchange for perpetual duration \nand limited liability, the corporation has some corresponding duties toward society. Also, if a corporation \nis legally a “person,” as the Supreme Court reaffirmed in 2010, then some would argue that if this \ncorporate person commits three felonies, it should be locked up for life and its corporate charter revoked! \n \nModern social contract theorists, such as Thomas Donaldson and Thomas Dunfee (Ties that Bind, 1999), \nobserve that various communities, not just nations, make rules for the common good. Your college or \nschool is a community, and there are communities within the school (fraternities, sororities, the folks \nbehind the counter at the circulation desk, the people who work together at the university radio station, \nthe sports teams, the faculty, the students generally, the gay and lesbian alliance) that have rules, norms, \nor standards that people can buy into or not. If not, they can exit from that community, just as we are free \n(though not without cost) to reject US citizenship and take up residence in another country. \n \nDonaldson and Dunfee’s integrative social contracts theory stresses the importance of studying the rules \nof smaller communities along with the larger social contracts made in states (such as Colorado or \nCalifornia) and nation-states (such as the United States or Germany). Our Constitution can be seen as a \nfundamental social contract. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n55 \nIt is important to realize that a social contract can be changed by the participants in a community, just as \nthe US Constitution can be amended. Social contract theory is thus dynamic—it allows for structural and \norganic changes. Ideally, the social contract struck by citizens and the government allows for certain \nfundamental rights such as those we enjoy in the United States, but it need not. People can give up \nfreedom-oriented rights (such as the right of free speech or the right to be free of unreasonable searches \nand seizures) to secure order (freedom from fear, freedom from terrorism). For example, many citizens in \nRussia now miss the days when the Kremlin was all powerful; there was less crime and more equality and \npredictability to life in the Soviet Union, even if there was less freedom. \n \nThus the rights that people have—in positive law—come from whatever social contract exists in the \nsociety. This view differs from that of the deontologists and that of the natural-law thinkers such as \nGandhi, Jesus, or Martin Luther King Jr., who believed that rights come from God or, in less religious \nterms, from some transcendent moral order. \n \nAnother important movement in ethics and society is the communitarian outlook. Communitarians \nemphasize that rights carry with them corresponding duties; that is, there cannot be a right without a \nduty. Interested students may wish to explore the work of Amitai Etzioni.

It claims to be nonsectarian, nonpartisan, and international in scope. \n \nThe relationship between rights and duties—in both law and ethics—calls for some explanations: \n \n1. If you have a right of free expression, the government has a duty to respect that right but can put \nreasonable limits on it. For example, you can legally say whatever you want about the US president, \nbut you can’t get away with threatening the president’s life. Even if your criticisms are strong and \ninsistent, you have the right (and our government has the duty to protect your right) to speak \nfreely. In Singapore during the 1990s, even indirect criticisms—mere hints—of the political \nleadership were enough to land you in jail or at least silence you with a libel suit. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n56 \n2. Rights and duties exist not only between people and their governments but also between \nindividuals. Your right to be free from physical assault is protected by the law in most states, and \nwhen someone walks up to you and punches you in the nose, your rights—as set forth in the \npositive law of your state—have been violated. Thus other people have a duty to respect your rights \nand to not punch you in the nose. \n3. Your right in legal terms is only as good as your society’s willingness to provide legal remedies \nthrough the courts and political institutions of society. \n \nA distinction between basic rights and nonbasic rights may also be important. Basic rights may include \nsuch fundamental elements as food, water, shelter, and physical safety. Another distinction is between \npositive rights (the right to bear arms, the right to vote, the right of privacy) and negative rights (the right \nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free of cruel or unusual punishments). \nYet another is between economic or social rights (adequate food, work, and environment) and political or \ncivic rights (the right to vote, the right to equal protection of the laws, the right to due process). \n \nAristotle and Virtue Theory \nVirtue theory, or virtue ethics, has received increasing attention over the past twenty years, particularly \nin contrast to utilitarian and deontological approaches to ethics. Virtue theory emphasizes the value of \nvirtuous qualities rather than formal rules or useful results. Aristotle is often recognized as the first \nphilosopher to advocate the ethical value of certain qualities, or virtues, in a person’s character. As LaRue \nHosmer has noted, Aristotle saw the goal of human existence as the active, rational search for excellence, \nand excellence requires the personal virtues of honesty, truthfulness, courage, temperance, generosity, \nand high-mindedness. This pursuit is also termed “knowledge of the good” in Greek philosophy. [1] \n \nAristotle believed that all activity was aimed at some goal or perceived good and that there must be some \nranking that we do among those goals or goods. Happiness may be our ultimate goal, but what does that \nmean, exactly? Aristotle rejected wealth, pleasure, and fame and embraced reason as the distinguishing \nfeature of humans, as opposed to other species. And since a human is a reasoning animal, happiness must \nbe associated with reason. Thus happiness is living according to the active (rather than passive) use of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n57 \nreason. The use of reason leads to excellence, and so happiness can be defined as the active, rational \npursuit of personal excellence, or virtue. \n \nAristotle named fourteen virtues: (1) courage, particularly in battle; (2) temperance, or moderation in \neating and drinking; (3) liberality, or spending money well; (4) magnificence, or living well; (5) pride, or \ntaking pleasure in accomplishments and stature; (6) high-mindedness, or concern with the noble rather \nthan the petty; (7) unnamed virtue, which is halfway between ambition and total lack of effort; (8) \ngentleness, or concern for others; (9) truthfulness; (10) wit, or pleasure in group discussions; (11) \nfriendliness, or pleasure in personal conduct; (12) modesty, or pleasure in personal conduct; (13) \nrighteous indignation, or getting angry at the right things and in the right amounts; and (14) justice.",

Magnificence, for \nexample, is not something we commonly speak of. Three issues emerge: (1) How do we know what a virtue \nis these days? (2) How useful is a list of agreed-upon virtues anyway? (3) What do virtues have to do with \ncompanies, particularly large ones where various groups and individuals may have little or no contact \nwith other parts of the organization? \n \nAs to the third question, whether corporations can “have” virtues or values is a matter of lively debate. A \ncorporation is obviously not the same as an individual. But there seems to be growing agreement that \norganizations do differ in their practices and that these practices are value driven. If all a company cares \nabout is the bottom line, other values will diminish or disappear. Quite a few books have been written in \nthe past twenty years that emphasize the need for businesses to define their values in order to be \ncompetitive in today’s global economy. [2] \n \nAs to the first two questions regarding virtues, a look at Michael Josephson’s core values may prove \nhelpful. \n \n \nJosephson’s Core Values Analysis and Decision Process \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n58 \nMichael Josephson, a noted American ethicist, believes that a current set of core values has been \nidentified and that the values can be meaningfully applied to a variety of personal and corporate \ndecisions. \n \nTo simplify, let’s say that there are ethical and nonethical qualities among people in the United States. \nWhen you ask people what kinds of qualities they admire in others or in themselves, they may say wealth, \npower, fitness, sense of humor, good looks, intelligence, musical ability, or some other quality. They may \nalso value honesty, caring, fairness, courage, perseverance, diligence, trustworthiness, or integrity. The \nqualities on the second list have something in common—they are distinctively ethical characteristics. That \nis, they are commonly seen as moral or ethical qualities, unlike the qualities on the first list. You can be, \nlike the Athenian Alcibiades, brilliant but unprincipled, or, like some political leaders today, powerful but \ndishonest, or wealthy but uncaring. You can, in short, have a number of admirable qualities (brilliance, \npower, wealth) that are not per se virtuous. Just because Harold is rich or good-looking or has a good \nsense of humor does not mean that he is ethical. But if Harold is honest and caring (whether he is rich or \npoor, humorous or humorless), people are likely to see him as ethical. \n \nAmong the virtues, are any especially important? Studies from the Josephson Institute of Ethics in \nMarina del Rey, California, have identified six core values in our society, values that almost everyone \nagrees are important to them. When asked what values people hold dear, what values they wish to be \nknown by, and what values they wish others would exhibit in their actions, six values consistently turn up: \n(1) trustworthiness, (2) respect, (3) responsibility, (4) fairness, (5) caring, and (6) citizenship. \n \nNote that these values are distinctly ethical. While many of us may value wealth, good looks, and \nintelligence, having wealth, good looks, and intelligence does not automatically make us virtuous in our \ncharacter and habits. But being more trustworthy (by being honest and by keeping promises) does make \nus more virtuous, as does staying true to the other five core values. \nNotice also that these six core values share something in common with other ethical values that are less \nuniversally agreed upon. Many values taught in the family or in places of worship are not generally agreed \non, practiced, or admired by all. Some families and individuals believe strongly in the virtue of saving \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n59 \nmoney or in abstaining from alcohol or sex prior to marriage. Others clearly do not, or at least don’t act on \ntheir beliefs. Moreover, it is possible to have and practice core ethical values even if you take on heavy \ndebt, knock down several drinks a night, or have frequent premarital sex. Some would dispute this, saying \nthat you can’t really lead a virtuous life if you get into debt, drink heavily, or engage in premarital sex. But",

The first view—maximizing profits—is \nthe prevailing view among business managers and in business schools. This view largely follows the idea \nof Milton Friedman that the duty of a manager is to maximize return on investment to the owners. In \nessence, managers’ legally prescribed duties are those that make their employment possible. In terms of \nthe legal organization of the corporation, the shareholders elect directors who hire managers, who have \nlegally prescribed duties toward both directors and shareholders. Those legally prescribed duties are a \nreflection of the fact that managers are managing other people’s money and have a moral duty to act as a \nresponsible agent for the owners. In law, this is called the manager’s fiduciary duty. Directors have the \nsame duties toward shareholders. Friedman emphasized the primacy of this duty in his writings about \ncorporations and social responsibility. \n \nMaximizing Profits: Milton Friedman \nEconomist Milton Friedman is often quoted as having said that the only moral duty a corporation has is to \nmake the most possible money, or to maximize profits, for its stockholders. Friedman’s beliefs are noted \nat length (see sidebar on Friedman’s article from the New York Times), but he asserted in a now-famous \n1970 article that in a free society, “there is one and only one social responsibility of business: to use its \nresources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits as long as it stays within the rules of the \ngame, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception and fraud.” What follows is \na major portion of what Friedman had to say in 1970. \n \n“The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits” \nMilton Friedman, New York Times Magazine, September 13, 1970 \n \nWhat does it mean to say that “business” has responsibilities? Only people can have \nresponsibilities. A corporation is an artificial person and in this sense may have artificial \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n67 \nresponsibilities, but “business” as a whole cannot be said to have responsibilities, even in this \nvague sense.… \n \nPresumably, the individuals who are to be responsible are businessmen, which means individual \nproprietors or corporate executives.…In a free enterprise, private-property system, a corporate \nexecutive is an employee of the owners of the business. He has direct responsibility to his \nemployers. That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which \ngenerally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the \nsociety, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.… \n \n…[T]he manager is that agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish the \neleemosynary institution, and his primary responsibility is to them… \nOf course, the corporate executive is also a person in his own right. As a person, he may have \nother responsibilities that he recognizes or assumes voluntarily—to his family, his conscience, his \nfeeling of charity, his church, his clubs, his city, his country. He may feel impelled by these \nresponsibilities to devote part of his income to causes he regards as worthy, to refuse to work for \nparticular corporations, even to leave his job…But in these respects he is acting as a principal, not \nan agent; he is spending his own money or time or energy, not the money of his employers or the \ntime or energy he has contracted to devote to their purposes. If these are “social responsibilities,” \nthey are the social responsibilities of individuals, not of business. \n \nWhat does it mean to say that the corporate executive has a “social responsibility” in his capacity \nas businessman? If this statement is not pure rhetoric, it must mean that he has to act in some \nway that is not in the interest of his employers. For example, that he is to refrain from increasing \nthe price of the product in order to contribute to the social objective of preventing inflation, even \nthough a price increase would be in the best interests of the corporation. Or that he is to make \nexpenditures on reducing pollution beyond the amount that is in the best interests of the",

But do they have explicit social responsibilities? Milton \nFriedman’s position suggests that having gone along with legal duties, the corporation can ignore any \nother social obligations. But there are others (such as advocates of stakeholder theory) who would say \nthat a corporation’s social responsibilities go beyond just staying within the law and go beyond the \ncorporation’s shareholders to include a number of other important stakeholders, those whose lives can be \naffected by corporate decisions. \n \nAccording to stakeholder theorists, corporations (and other business organizations) must pay attention \nnot only to the bottom line but also to their overall effect on the community. Public perception of a \ncompany’s unfairness, uncaring, disrespect, or lack of trustworthiness often leads to long-term failure, \nwhatever the short-term successes or profits may be. A socially responsible corporation is likely to \nconsider the impact of its decisions on a wide range of stakeholders, not just shareholders. As Table 2.1 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n70 \n\"The Stakes of Various Stakeholders\" indicates, stakeholders have very different kinds of interests \n(“stakes”) in the actions of a corporation. \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.1 The Stakes of Various Stakeholders \nOwnership \nThe value of the organization has a direct impact on the wealth of these \nstakeholders. \nManagers \nDirectors who \nown stock \nShareholders \nEconomic \nDependence \nStakeholders can be economically dependent without having ownership. \nEach of these stakeholders relies on the corporation in some way for \nfinancial well-being. \nSalaried \nmanagers \nCreditors \nSuppliers \nEmployees \nLocal \ncommunities \nSocial Interests \nThese stakeholders are not directly linked to the organization but have \nan interest in making sure the organization acts in a socially responsible \nmanner. \nCommunities \nGovernment \nMedia \n \nCorporate Culture and Codes of Ethics \nA corporation is a “person” capable of suing, being sued, and having rights and duties in our legal system. \n(It is a legal or juridical person, not a natural person, according to our Supreme Court.) Moreover, many \ncorporations have distinct cultures and beliefs that are lived and breathed by its members. Often, the \nculture of a corporation is the best defense against individuals within that firm who may be tempted to \nbreak the law or commit serious ethical misdeeds. \n \nWhat follows is a series of observations about corporations, ethics, and corporate culture. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n71 \nEthical Leadership Is Top-Down \nPeople in an organization tend to watch closely what the top managers do and say. Regardless of \nmanagers’ talk about ethics, employees quickly learn what speech or actions are in fact rewarded. If the \nCEO is firm about acting ethically, others in the organization will take their cues from him or her. People \nat the top tend to set the target, the climate, the beliefs, and the expectations that fuel behavior. \nAccountability Is Often Weak \nClever managers can learn to shift blame to others, take credit for others’ work, and move on before \n“funny numbers” or other earnings management tricks come to light. [1] Again, we see that the manager is \noften an agent for himself or herself and will often act more in his or her self-interest than for the \ncorporate interest. \n \nKilling the Messenger \nWhere organizations no longer function, inevitably some employees are unhappy. If they call attention to \nproblems that are being covered up by coworkers or supervisors, they bring bad news. Managers like to \nhear good news and discourage bad news. Intentionally or not, those who told on others, or blew the \nwhistle, have rocked the boat and become unpopular with those whose defalcations they report on and \nwith the managers who don’t really want to hear the bad news. In many organizations, “killing the \nmessenger” solves the problem. Consider James Alexander at Enron Corporation, who was deliberately \nshut out after bringing problems to CEO Ken Lay’s attention. [2]When Sherron Watkins sent Ken Lay a \nletter warning him about Enron’s accounting practices, CFO Andrew Fastow tried to fire her. [3] \n \nEthics Codes \nWithout strong leadership and a willingness to listen to bad news as well as good news, managers do not \nhave the feedback necessary to keep the organization healthy. Ethics codes have been put in place—partly \nin response to federal sentencing guidelines and partly to encourage feedback loops to top management. \nThe best ethics codes are aspirational, or having an ideal to be pursued, not legalistic or compliance \ndriven. The Johnson & Johnson ethics code predated the Tylenol scare and the company’s oft-celebrated \ncorporate response. [4] The corporate response was consistent with that code, which was lived and",

In certain cases, appellants to the highest court in a state have \nthe right to have their appeals heard, but more often the supreme court selects the cases it wishes to hear. \nFor most litigants, the ruling of the state supreme court is final. In a relatively small class of cases—those \nin which federal constitutional claims are made—appeal to the US Supreme Court to issue \na writ of certiorari remains a possibility. \n \nThe Federal Court System \nDistrict Courts \nThe federal judicial system is uniform throughout the United States and consists of three levels. At the \nfirst level are the federal district courts, which are the trial courts in the federal system. Every state has \none or more federal districts; the less populous states have one, and the more populous states (California, \nTexas, and New York) have four. The federal court with the heaviest commercial docket is the US District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). There are forty-four district judges and fifteen \nmagistrates in this district.

Each circuit oversees the work of the district courts in \nseveral states. For example, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit hears appeals from district \ncourts in New York, Connecticut, and Vermont. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hears \nappeals from district courts in California, Oregon, Nevada, Montana, Washington, Idaho, Arizona, Alaska, \nHawaii, and Guam. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears appeals from the \ndistrict court in Washington, DC, as well as from numerous federal administrative agencies (see Chapter 5 \n\"Administrative Law\"). The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, also located in Washington, hears \nappeals in patent and customs cases. Appeals are usually heard by three-judge panels, but sometimes \nthere will be a rehearing at the court of appeals level, in which case all judges sit to hear the case “en \nbanc.” \n \nThere are also several specialized courts in the federal judicial system. These include the US Tax Court, \nthe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and the Court of Claims. \n \nUnited States Supreme Court \nOverseeing all federal courts is the US Supreme Court, in Washington, DC. It consists of nine justices—the \nchief justice and eight associate justices. (This number is not constitutionally required; Congress can \nestablish any number. It has been set at nine since after the Civil War.) The Supreme Court has selective \ncontrol over most of its docket. By law, the cases it hears represent only a tiny fraction of the cases that are \nsubmitted. In 2008, the Supreme Court had numerous petitions (over 7,000, not including thousands of \npetitions from prisoners) but heard arguments in only 87 cases. The Supreme Court does not sit in panels. \nAll the justices hear and consider each case together, unless a justice has a conflict of interest and must \nwithdraw from hearing the case. \n \nFigure 3.1 The Federal Judicial Circuits \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n88 \n \nFederal judges—including Supreme Court justices—are nominated by the president and must be \nconfirmed by the Senate.

After the \npleadings, the parties may make various motions, which are requests to the judge.

If the plaintiff successfully \nappeals a summary judgment motion, the case will come back to the trial court. \n \nPrior to the trial, the judge may also convene the parties in an effort to investigate the possibilities of \nsettlement. Usually, the judge will explore the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case with the \nattorneys. The parties may decide that it is more prudent or efficient to settle than to risk going to \ntrial. \n \nPretrial Conference \nAt various times during the discovery process, depending on the nature and complexity of the case, the \ncourt may hold a pretrial conference to clarify the issues and establish a timetable. The court may also \nhold a settlement conference to see if the parties can work out their differences and avoid trial altogether. \nOnce discovery is complete, the case moves on to trial if it has not been settled. Most cases are settled \nbefore this stage; perhaps 85 percent of all civil cases end before trial, and more than 90 percent of \ncriminal prosecutions end with a guilty plea. \n \nTrial \nAt trial, the first order of business is to select a jury. (In a civil case of any consequence, either party can \nrequest one, based on the Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution.) The judge and sometimes the \nlawyers are permitted to question the jurors to be sure that they are unbiased. This questioning is known \nas the voir dire (pronounced vwahr-DEER). This is an important process, and a great deal of thought goes \ninto selecting the jury, especially in high-profile cases. A jury panel can be as few as six persons, or as \nmany as twelve, with alternates selected and sitting in court in case one of the jurors is unable to continue. \nIn a long trial, having alternates is essential; even in shorter trials, most courts will have at least two \nalternate jurors. \n \nIn both criminal and civil trials, each side has opportunities to challenge potential jurors for cause.

If not voluntarily, then the \nlosing party’s assets can be seized or its wages or other income garnished to satisfy the judgment. If the \nfinal judgment is an injunction, failure to follow its dictates can lead to a contempt citation, with a fine or \njail time imposed. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe process of conducting a civil trial has many aspects, starting with pleadings and continuing with motions, \ndiscovery, more motions, pretrial conferences, and finally the trial itself. At all stages, the rules of civil \nprocedure attempt to give both sides plenty of notice, opportunity to be heard, discovery of relevant \ninformation, cross-examination, and the preservation of procedural objections for purposes of appeal. All of \nthese rules and procedures are intended to provide each side with a fair trial. \n \nEXERCISES \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n120 \n1. Mrs. Robinson has a key witness on auto safety that the judge believes is not qualified as an expert. The \njudge examines the witness while the jury is in the jury room and disqualifies him from testifying. The jury \ndoes not get to hear this witness. Her attorney objects. She loses her case. What argument would you \nexpect Mrs. Robinson’s attorney to make in an appeal? \n2. Why don’t appellate courts need a witness box for witnesses to give testimony under oath? \n3. A trial judge in Nevada is wondering whether to enforce a surrogate motherhood contract. Penelope \nBarr, of Reno, Nevada, has contracted with Reuben and Tina Goldberg to bear the in vitro fertilized egg \nof Mrs. Goldberg. After carrying the child for nine months, Penelope gives birth, but she is reluctant to \ngive up the child, even though she was paid $20,000 at the start of the contract and will earn an \nadditional $20,000 on handing over the baby to the Goldbergs. (Barr was an especially good candidate \nfor surrogate motherhood: she had borne two perfect children and at age 28 drinks no wine, does not \nsmoke or use drugs of any kind, practices yoga, and maintains a largely vegetarian diet with just \nenough meat to meet the needs of the fetus within.) \nThe Goldbergs have asked the judge for an order compelling Penelope to give up the baby, who was \nfive days old when the lawsuit was filed. The baby is now a month old as the judge looks in vain for \nguidance from any Nevada statute, federal statute, or any prior case in Nevada that addressed the \nissue of surrogate motherhood. He does find several well-reasoned cases, one from New Jersey, one \nfrom Michigan, and one from Oregon. Are any of these “precedent” that he must follow? May he \nadopt the reasoning of any of these courts, if he should find that reasoning persuasive? \n \n \n \n \n3.6 When Can Someone Bring a Lawsuit? \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain the requirements for standing to bring a lawsuit in US courts. \n2. Describe the process by which a group or class of plaintiffs can be certified to file a class action case. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n121 \n \n \nAlmost anyone can bring a lawsuit, assuming they have the filing fee and the help of an attorney. But \nthe court may not hear it, for a number of reasons. There may be no case or controversy, there may \nbe no law to support the plaintiff’s claim, it may be in the wrong court, too much time might have \nlapsed (a statute of limitations problem), or the plaintiff may not have standing. \n \nCase or Controversy: Standing to Sue \nArticle III of the US Constitution provides limits to federal judicial power. For some cases, the Supreme \nCourt has decided that it has no power to adjudicate because there is no “case or controversy.” For \nexample, perhaps the case has settled or the “real parties in interest” are not before the court. In such a \ncase, a court might dismiss the case on the grounds that the plaintiff does not have “standing” to sue. \n \nFor example, suppose you see a sixteen-wheel moving van drive across your neighbor’s flower bed, \ndestroying her beloved roses. You have enjoyed seeing her roses every summer, for years. She is forlorn \nand tells you that she is not going to raise roses there anymore. She also tells you that she has decided not \nto sue, because she has made the decision to never deal with lawyers if at all possible. Incensed, you \ndecide to sue on her behalf.

Standing means that only the person whose interests are directly \naffected has the legal right to sue. \n \nThe standing doctrine is easy to understand in straightforward cases such as this but is often a fairly \ncomplicated matter. For example, can fifteen or more state attorneys general bring a lawsuit for a \ndeclaratory judgment that the health care legislation passed in 2010 is unconstitutional? What particular \ninjury have they (or the states) suffered? Are they the best set of plaintiffs to raise this issue? Time—and \nthe Supreme Court—will tell. \n \nClass Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n122 \nMost lawsuits concern a dispute between two people or between a person and a company or other \norganization. But it can happen that someone injures more than one person at the same time. A driver \nwho runs a red light may hit another car carrying one person or many people. If several people are injured \nin the same accident, they each have the right to sue the driver for the damage that he caused them. Could \nthey sue as a group? Usually not, because the damages would probably not be the same for each person, \nand different facts would have to be proved at the trial. Plus, the driver of the car that was struck might \nhave been partially to blame, so the defendant’s liability toward him might be different from his liability \ntoward the passengers. \n \nIf, however, the potential plaintiffs were all injured in the same way and their injuries were identical, a \nsingle lawsuit might be a far more efficient way of determining liability and deciding financial \nresponsibility than many individual lawsuits. \n \nHow could such a suit be brought? All the injured parties could hire the same lawyer, and she could \npresent a common case. But with a group numbering more than a handful of people, it could become \noverwhelmingly complicated. So how could, say, a million stockholders who believed they were cheated by \na corporation ever get together to sue? \n \nBecause of these types of situations, there is a legal procedure that permits one person or a small group of \npeople to serve as representatives for all others. This is the class action. The class action is provided for in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule 23) and in the separate codes of civil procedure in the states. \nThese rules differ among themselves and are often complex, but in general anyone can file a class action in \nan appropriate case, subject to approval of the court. Once the class is “certified,” or judged to be a legally \nadequate group with common injuries, the lawyers for the named plaintiffs become, in effect, lawyers for \nthe entire class. \n \nUsually a person who doesn’t want to be in the class can decide to leave. If she does, she will not be \nincluded in an eventual judgment or settlement. But a potential plaintiff who is included in the class \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n123 \ncannot, after a final judgment is awarded, seek to relitigate the issue if she is dissatisfied with the \noutcome, even though she did not participate at all in the legal proceeding. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAnyone can file a lawsuit, with or without the help of an attorney, but only those lawsuits where a plaintiff has \nstanding will be heard by the courts. Standing has become a complicated question and is used by the courts to \nensure that civil cases heard are being pursued by those with tangible and particular injuries. Class actions are \na way of aggregating claims that are substantially similar and arise out of the same facts and circumstances. \n \nEXERCISE \n \n1. Fuchs Funeral Home is carrying the body of Charles Emmenthaler to its resting place at Forest Lawn \nCemetery. Charles’s wife, Chloe, and their two children, Chucky and Clarice, are following the hearse \nwhen the coffin falls on the street, opens, and the body of Charles Emmenthaler falls out. The wife and \nchildren are shocked and aggrieved and later sue in civil court for damages.

For example, they may name the specific person or delegate the responsibility \nof choosing to some neutral person, or they may each designate a person and the two designees may \njointly pick a third arbitrator. \n \nMany arbitrations take place under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association, a private \norganization headquartered in New York, with regional offices in many other cities. The association uses \npublished sets of rules for various types of arbitration (e.g., labor arbitration or commercial arbitration); \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n128 \nparties who provide in contracts for arbitration through the association are agreeing to be bound by the \nassociation’s rules. Similarly, the National Association of Securities Dealers provides arbitration services \nfor disputes between clients and brokerage firms. International commercial arbitration often takes place \nthrough the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce. A multilateral agreement known as the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards provides that agreements to \narbitrate—and arbitral awards—will be enforced across national boundaries. \n \nArbitration has two advantages over litigation. First, it is usually much quicker, because the arbitrator \ndoes not have a backlog of cases and because the procedures are simpler. Second, in complex cases, the \nquality of the decision may be higher, because the parties can select an arbitrator with specialized \nknowledge. \n \nUnder both federal and state law, arbitration is favored, and a decision rendered by an arbitrator is \nbinding by law and may be enforced by the courts. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, with very \nfew exceptions (such as fraud or manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrator or panel of arbitrators). \nSaying that arbitration is favored means that if you have agreed to arbitration, you can’t go to court if the \nother party wants you to arbitrate. Under the Federal Arbitration Act, the other party can go to court and \nget a stay against your litigation and also get an order compelling you to go to arbitration. \n \nMediation \nUnlike adjudication, mediation gives the neutral party no power to impose a decision. The mediator is a \ngo-between who attempts to help the parties negotiate a solution. The mediator will communicate the \nparties’ positions to each other, will facilitate the finding of common ground, and will suggest outcomes. \nBut the parties have complete control: they may ignore the recommendations of the mediator entirely, \nsettle in their own way, find another mediator, agree to binding arbitration, go to court, or forget the \nwhole thing! \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n129 \nLitigation is not the only way to resolve disputes. Informal negotiation between the disputants usually comes \nfirst, but both mediation and arbitration are available. Arbitration, though, is final and binding. Once you \nagree to arbitrate, you will have a final, binding arbitral award that is enforceable through the courts, and \ncourts will almost never allow you to litigate after you have agreed to arbitrate. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no \ntestimony during the trial that either plaintiff Susan Ferlito or her husband, plaintiff Frank J. Ferlito, \nwould have acted any different if there had been a flammability warning on the product’s package. The \nabsence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs’ case; for without it, plaintiffs have failed to prove \nproximate cause, one of the essential elements of their negligence claim. \nIn addition, both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame. \nSusan Ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if \nexposed to an open flame. Frank Ferlito testified that he knew at the time he appeared at the Halloween \nparty that cotton batting would burn if exposed to an open flame. His additional testimony that he would \nnot have intentionally put a flame to the cotton batting shows that he recognized the risk of injury of \nwhich he claims JJP should have warned. Because both plaintiffs were already aware of the danger, a \nwarning by JJP would have been superfluous. Therefore, a reasonable jury could not have found that \nJJP’s failure to provide a warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs’ injuries. \n \nThe evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that neither the use to which plaintiffs put JJP’s product \nnor the injuries arising from that use were foreseeable. Susan Ferlito testified that the idea for the \ncostume was hers alone. As described on the product’s package, its intended uses are for cleansing, \napplying medications, and infant care.

Business and commerce are directly affected \nby the words, meanings, and interpretations of the Constitution. Because it speaks in general terms, \nits provisions raise all kinds of issues for scholars, lawyers, judges, politicians, and commentators. \nFor example, arguments still rage over the nature and meaning of “federalism,” the concept that \nthere is shared governance between the states and the federal government. The US Supreme Court is \nthe ultimate arbiter of those disputes, and as such it has a unique role in the legal system. It has \nassumed the power of judicial review, unique among federal systems globally, through which it can \nstrike down federal or state statutes that it believes violate the Constitution and can even void the \npresident’s executive orders if they are contrary to the Constitution’s language. No knowledgeable \ncitizen or businessperson can afford to be ignorant of its basic provisions. \n \n \n4.1 Basic Aspects of the US Constitution \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Describe the American values that are reflected in the US Constitution. \n2. Know what federalism means, along with separation of powers. \n3. Explain the process of amending the Constitution and why judicial review is particularly significant. \n \n \nThe Constitution as Reflecting American Values \nIn the US, the one document to which all public officials and military personnel pledge their unswerving \nallegiance is the Constitution. If you serve, you are asked to “support and defend” the Constitution \n“against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” The oath usually includes a statement that you swear that this \noath is taken freely, honestly, and without “any purpose of evasion.” This loyalty oath may be related to a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n141 \ntime—fifty years ago—when “un-American” activities were under investigation in Congress and the press; \nthe fear of communism (as antithetical to American values and principles) was paramount. As you look at \nthe Constitution and how it affects the legal environment of business, please consider what basic values it \nmay impart to us and what makes it uniquely American and worth defending “against all enemies, foreign \nand domestic.” \n \nIn Article I, the Constitution places the legislature first and prescribes the ways in which representatives \nare elected to public office. Article I balances influence in the federal legislature between large states and \nsmall states by creating a Senate in which the smaller states (by population) as well as the larger states \nhave two votes. In Article II, the Constitution sets forth the powers and responsibilities of the branch—the \npresidency—and makes it clear that the president should be the commander in chief of the armed forces. \nArticle II also gives states rather than individuals (through the Electoral College) a clear role in the \nelection process. Article III creates the federal judiciary, and the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, makes \nclear that individual rights must be preserved against activities of the federal government. In general, the \nidea of rights is particularly strong. \n \nThe Constitution itself speaks of rights in fairly general terms, and the judicial interpretation of various \nrights has been in flux. The “right” of a person to own another person was notably affirmed by the \nSupreme Court in the Dred Scott decision in 1857. [1] The “right” of a child to freely contract for long, \ntedious hours of work was upheld by the court in Hammer v. Dagenhart in 1918. Both decisions were \nlater repudiated, just as the decision that a woman has a “right” to an abortion in the first trimester of \npregnancy could later be repudiated ifRoe v. Wade is overturned by the Supreme Court. [2] \n \nGeneral Structure of the Constitution \nLook at the Constitution. Notice that there are seven articles, starting with Article I (legislative powers), \nArticle II (executive branch), and Article III (judiciary). Notice that there is no separate article for \nadministrative agencies. The Constitution also declares that it is “the supreme Law of the Land” (Article \nVI). Following Article VII are the ten amendments adopted in 1791 that are referred to as the Bill of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n142 \nRights. Notice also that in 1868, a new amendment, the Fourteenth, was adopted, requiring states to \nprovide “due process” and “equal protection of the laws” to citizens of the United States. \n \nFederalism \nThe partnership created in the Constitution between the states and the federal government is",

United States, the Supreme Court had \nsustained the power of Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drug Act, which prohibited the introduction \ninto the states by means of interstate commerce impure foods and drugs. [1] In Hoke v. United States, the \nSupreme Court had sustained the constitutionality of the so-called White Slave Traffic Act of 1910, \nwhereby the transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution was \nforbidden. In that case, the court said that Congress had the power to protect the channels of interstate \ncommerce: “If the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of \nlotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n148 \nfood and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to, and the enslavement \nin prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.” [2] \n \nIn each of those instances, the Supreme Court said, “[T]he use of interstate transportation was necessary \nto the accomplishment of harmful results.” In other words, although the power over interstate \ntransportation was to regulate, that could only be accomplished by prohibiting the use of the facilities of \ninterstate commerce to effect the evil intended. But in Hammer v. Dagenhart, that essential element was \nlacking. The law passed by Congress aimed to standardize among all the states the ages at which children \ncould be employed in mining and manufacturing, while the goods themselves are harmless. Once the \nlabor is done and the articles have left the factory, the “labor of their production is over, and the mere fact \nthat they were intended for interstate commerce transportation does not make their production subject to \nfederal control under the commerce power.” \n \nIn short, the early use of the commerce clause was limited to the movement of physical goods between \nstates. Just because something might enter the channels of interstate commerce later on does not make it \na fit subject for national regulation. The production of articles intended for interstate commerce is a \nmatter of local regulation. The court therefore upheld the result from the district and circuit court of \nappeals; the application of the federal law was enjoined. Goods produced by children under the age of \nfourteen could be shipped anywhere in the United States without violating the federal law. \n \nFrom the New Deal to the New Frontier and the Great  \nSociety: 1930s–1970 \nDuring the global depression of the 1930s, the US economy saw jobless rates of a third of all workers, and \nPresident Roosevelt’s New Deal program required more active federal legislation. Included in the New \nDeal program was the recognition of a “right” to form labor unions without undue interference from \nemployers. Congress created the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 to investigate and to \nenjoin employer practices that violated this right. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n149 \nIn NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, a union dispute with management at a large steel-\nproducing facility near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became a court case. In this case, the NLRB had charged \nthe Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation with discriminating against employees who were union members. \nThe company’s position was that the law authorizing the NLRB was unconstitutional, exceeding \nCongress’s powers. The court held that the act was narrowly constructed so as to regulate industrial \nactivities that had the potential to restrict interstate commerce. The earlier decisions under the commerce \nclause to the effect that labor relations had only an indirect effect on commerce were effectively reversed. \nSince the ability of employees to engage in collective bargaining (one activity protected by the act) is “an \nessential condition of industrial peace,” the national government was justified in penalizing corporations \nengaging in interstate commerce that “refuse to confer and negotiate” with their workers. This was, \nhowever, a close decision, and the switch of one justice made this ruling possible. Without this switch, the \nNew Deal agenda would have been effectively derailed. \n \nThe Substantial Effects Doctrine: World War II to the 1990s \nSubsequent to NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress and the courts generally accepted \nthat even modest impacts on interstate commerce were “reachable” by federal legislation. For example, \nthe case of Wickard v. Filburn, from 1942, represents a fairly long reach for Congress in regulating what \nappear to be very local economic decisions (Section 4.6.2). \n \nWickard established that “substantial effects” in interstate commerce could be very local indeed! But \ncommerce clause challenges to federal legislation continued. In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was",

Brzonkala then sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in federal district court, alleging \nthat Morrison’s and Crawford’s attack violated 42 USC Section 13981, part of the VAWA), which provides \na federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-motivated violence. Morrison and Crawford moved to \ndismiss Brzonkala’s suit on the ground that Section 13981’s civil remedy was unconstitutional. In \ndismissing the complaint, the district court found that that Congress lacked authority to enact Section \n13981 under either the commerce clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, which Congress had explicitly \nidentified as the sources of federal authority for the VAWA. Ultimately, the court of appeals affirmed, as \ndid the Supreme Court. \n \nThe Supreme Court held that Congress lacked the authority to enact a statute under the commerce clause \nor the Fourteenth Amendment because the statute did not regulate an activity that substantially affected \ninterstate commerce nor did it redress harm caused by the state. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist \nwrote for the court that “under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and not by the United States.” Dissenting, Justice Stephen G. Breyer argued that the majority \nopinion “illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstone.” Justice \nDavid H. Souter, dissenting, noted that VAWA contained a “mountain of data assembled by \nCongress…showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.” \n \nThe absence of a workable judicial commerce clause touchstone remains. In 1996, California voters \npassed the Compassionate Use Act, legalizing marijuana for medical use. California’s law conflicted with \nthe federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which banned possession of marijuana. After the Drug \nEnforcement Administration (DEA) seized doctor-prescribed marijuana from a patient’s home, a group of \nmedical marijuana users sued the DEA and US Attorney General John Ashcroft in federal district court. \n \nThe medical marijuana users argued that the CSA—which Congress passed using its constitutional power \nto regulate interstate commerce—exceeded Congress’s commerce clause power. The district court ruled \nagainst the group, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and ruled the CSA unconstitutional \nbecause it applied to medical marijuana use solely within one state. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit relied \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n152 \non U.S. v. Lopez (1995) and U.S. v. Morrison (2000) to say that using medical marijuana did not \n“substantially affect” interstate commerce and therefore could not be regulated by Congress. \n \nBut by a 6–3 majority, the Supreme Court held that the commerce clause gave Congress authority to \nprohibit the local cultivation and use of marijuana, despite state law to the contrary. Justice John Paul \nStevens argued that the court’s precedents established Congress’s commerce clause power to regulate \npurely local activities that are part of a “class of activities” with a substantial effect on interstate \ncommerce. The majority argued that Congress could ban local marijuana use because it was part of such a \nclass of activities: the national marijuana market. Local use affected supply and demand in the national \nmarijuana market, making the regulation of intrastate use “essential” to regulating the drug’s national \nmarket. \nNotice how similar this reasoning is to the court’s earlier reasoning in Wickard v. Filburn (Section 4.6.2). \nIn contrast, the court’s conservative wing was adamant that federal power had been exceeded. Justice \nClarence Thomas’s dissent in Gonzalez v. Raich stated that Raich’s local cultivation and consumption of \nmarijuana was not “Commerce…among the several States.” Representing the “originalist” view that the \nConstitution should mostly mean what the Founders meant it to mean, he also said that in the early days \nof the republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, \npossession, and consumption of marijuana. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe commerce clause is the basis on which the federal government regulates interstate economic activity. The \nphrase “interstate commerce” has been subject to differing interpretations by the Supreme Court over the \npast one hundred years.

Understand the role of the supremacy clause in the balance between state and federal power. \n2. Give examples of cases where state legislation is preempted by federal law and cases where state \nlegislation is not preempted by federal law. \n \n \nWhen Congress does use its power under the commerce clause, it can expressly state that it wishes to have \nexclusive regulatory authority. For example, when Congress determined in the 1950s to promote nuclear \npower (“atoms for peace”), it set up the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and provided a limitation of \nliability for nuclear power plants in case of a nuclear accident. The states were expressly told to stay out of \nthe business of regulating nuclear power or the movement of nuclear materials. Thus Rochester, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n159 \nMinnesota, or Berkeley, California, could declare itself a nuclear-free zone, but the federal government \nwould have preempted such legislation. If Michigan wished to set safety standards at Detroit Edison’s \nFermi II nuclear reactor that were more stringent than the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s \nstandards, Michigan’s standards would be preempted and thus be void. \n \nEven where Congress does not expressly preempt state action, such action may be impliedly pre-empted. \nStates cannot constitutionally pass laws that interfere with the accomplishment of the purposes of the \nfederal law. Suppose, for example, that Congress passes a comprehensive law that sets standards for \nforeign vessels to enter the navigable waters and ports of the United States. If a state creates a law that \nsets standards that conflict with the federal law or sets standards so burdensome that they interfere with \nfederal law, the doctrine of preemption will (in accordance with the supremacy clause) void the state \nlaw or whatever parts of it are inconsistent with federal law.",

It is for this reason that the National Enquirer writes exclusively about public figures, public \nofficials, and celebrities; it is possible to say many things that aren’t completely true and still have the \nprotection of the First Amendment. \n \nPolitical speech is so highly protected that the court has recognized the right of people to support political \ncandidates through campaign contributions and thus promote the particular viewpoints and speech of \nthose candidates. Fearing the influence of money on politics, Congress has from time to time placed \nlimitations on corporate contributions to political campaigns. But the Supreme Court has had mixed \nreactions over time. Initially, the court recognized the First Amendment right of a corporation to donate \nmoney, subject to certain limits. [2] In another case, Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), the \nMichigan Campaign Finance Act prohibited corporations from using treasury money for independent \nexpenditures to support or oppose candidates in elections for state offices. But a corporation could make \nsuch expenditures if it set up an independent fund designated solely for political purposes. The law was \npassed on the assumption that “the unique legal and economic characteristics of corporations necessitate \nsome regulation of their political expenditures to avoid corruption or the appearance of corruption.” \n \nThe Michigan Chamber of Commerce wanted to support a candidate for Michigan’s House of \nRepresentatives by using general funds to sponsor a newspaper advertisement and argued that as a \nnonprofit organization, it was not really like a business firm. The court disagreed and upheld the Michigan \nlaw. Justice Marshall found that the chamber was akin to a business group, given its activities, linkages \nwith community business leaders, and high percentage of members (over 75 percent) that were business \ncorporations. Furthermore, Justice Marshall found that the statute was narrowly crafted and \nimplemented to achieve the important goal of maintaining integrity in the political process. But as you \nwill see in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (Section 4.6 \"Cases\"), Austin was overruled; \ncorporations are recognized as “persons” with First Amendment political speech rights that cannot be \nimpaired by Congress or the states without some compelling governmental interest with restrictions on \nthose rights that are “narrowly tailored.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n166 \n \nFourth Amendment \nThe Fourth Amendment says, “all persons shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects \nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, before a \nmagistrate and upon Oath, specifically describing the persons to be searched and places to be seized.” \n \nThe court has read the Fourth Amendment to prohibit only those government searches or seizures that \nare “unreasonable.” Because of this, businesses that are in an industry that is “closely regulated” can be \nsearched more frequently and can be searched without a warrant. In one case, an auto parts dealer at a \njunkyard was charged with receiving stolen auto parts. Part of his defense was to claim that the search \nthat found incriminating evidence was unconstitutional. But the court found the search reasonable, \nbecause the dealer was in a “closely regulated industry.” \n \nIn the 1980s, Dow Chemical objected to an overflight by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \nThe EPA had rented an airplane to fly over the Midland, Michigan, Dow plant, using an aerial mapping \ncamera to photograph various pipes, ponds, and machinery that were not covered by a roof. Because the \ncourt’s precedents allowed governmental intrusions into “open fields,” the EPA search was ruled \nconstitutional. Because the literal language of the Fourth Amendment protected “persons, houses, papers, \nand effects,” anything searched by the government in “open fields” was reasonable. (The court’s opinion \nsuggested that if Dow had really wanted privacy from governmental intrusion, it could have covered the \npipes and machinery that were otherwise outside and in open fields.) \n \nNote again that constitutional guarantees like the Fourth Amendment apply to governmental action.

In terms of procedural due process, the amendment prevents \ngovernment from arbitrarily taking the life of a criminal defendant. In civil lawsuits, it is also \nconstitutionally essential that the proceedings be fair. This is why, for example, the defendant in Burger \nKing v. Rudzewicz had a serious constitutional argument, even though he lost. \n \nThe takings clause of the Fifth Amendment ensures that the government does not take private property \nwithout just compensation. In the international setting, governments that take private property engage in \nwhat is called expropriation. The standard under customary international law is that when governments \ndo that, they must provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. This does not always happen, \nespecially where foreign owners’ property is being expropriated. The guarantees of the Fifth Amendment \n(incorporated against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment) are available to property owners where \nstate, county, or municipal government uses the power of eminent domain to take private property for \npublic purposes. Just what is a public purpose is a matter of some debate. For example, if a city were to \ncondemn economically viable businesses or neighborhoods to construct a baseball stadium with public \nmoney to entice a private enterprise (the baseball team) to stay, is a public purpose being served? \n \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, Mrs. Kelo and other residents fought the city of New London, in its \nattempt to use powers of eminent domain to create an industrial park and recreation area that would have \nPfizer & Co. as a principal tenant. [3] The city argued that increasing its tax base was a sufficient public \npurpose. In a very close decision, the Supreme Court determined that New London’s actions did not \nviolate the takings clause. However, political reactions in various states resulted in a great deal of new \nstate legislation that would limit the scope of public purpose in eminent domain takings and provide \nadditional compensation to property owners in many cases. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n168 \nIn addition to the takings clause and aspects of procedural due process, the Fifth Amendment is also the \nsource of what is called substantive due process. During the first third of the twentieth century, the \nSupreme Court often nullified state and federal laws using substantive due process. In 1905, for example, \nin Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court voided a New York statute that limited the number of hours \nthat bakers could work in a single week. New York had passed the law to protect the health of employees, \nbut the court found that this law interfered with the basic constitutional right of private parties to freely \ncontract with one another. Over the next thirty years, dozens of state and federal laws were struck down \nthat aimed to improve working conditions, secure social welfare, or establish the rights of unions. \nHowever, in 1934, during the Great Depression, the court reversed itself and began upholding the kinds of \nlaws it had struck down earlier. \n \nSince then, the court has employed a two-tiered analysis of substantive due process claims. Under the first \ntier, legislation on economic matters, employment relations, and other business affairs is subject to \nminimal judicial scrutiny. This means that a law will be overturned only if it serves no rational \ngovernment purpose. Under the second tier, legislation concerning fundamental liberties is subject to \n“heightened judicial scrutiny,” meaning that a law will be invalidated unless it is “narrowly tailored to \nserve a significant government purpose.” \n \nThe Supreme Court has identified two distinct categories of fundamental liberties.

And that I cannot do. \n \nIn the course of its opinion the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution: the First, \nthe Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth. But the Court does not say which of these \nAmendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law. \n \n… \n \nAs to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this \nConnecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States. It has \nnot even been argued that this is a law “respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.” And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the \nlevel of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of “the freedom of speech, or of the \npress; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of \ngrievances.” No soldier has been quartered in any house. There has been no search, and no seizure. \nNobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself. \n \nThe Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother Goldberg’s concurring opinion relies \nheavily upon it. But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn \nsomersaults with history. The Ninth Amendment, like its companion the Tenth, which this Court held \n“states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,” United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. \n100, 124, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption \nof the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that the Federal Government was to be a government of express \nand limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the \nindividual States. Until today no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment \nmeant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n177 \npassed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James \nMadison no little wonder. \n \nWhat provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid? The Court says it is the right of \nprivacy “created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.” With all deference, I can find no such \ngeneral right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever \nbefore decided by this Court. \n \nAt the oral argument in this case we were told that the Connecticut law does not “conform to current \ncommunity standards.” But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community \nstandards. We are here to decide cases “agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States.” It is \nthe essence of judicial duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is \nwise and what is not. If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect the standards of the \npeople of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth \nAmendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it. That is the constitutional way to \ntake this law off the books. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Which opinion is the strict constructionist opinion here—Justice Douglas’s or that of Justices Stewart and \nBlack? \n2. What would have happened if the Supreme Court had allowed the Connecticut Supreme Court decision to \nstand and followed Justice Black’s reasoning? Is it likely that the citizens of Connecticut would have \npersuaded their elected representatives to repeal the law challenged here? \n \n \nWickard v. Filburn \nWickard v.

Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 \n(1945). \n \nThe extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure. It may be said with confidence, \nhowever, that a State’s power to regulate commerce is never greater than in matters traditionally of local \nconcern. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, supra at 432 U.S. 350. For example, regulations that \ntouch upon safety—especially highway safety—are those that “the Court has been most reluctant to \ninvalidate.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. 443 (and other cases cited). Indeed, “if safety justifications are \nnot illusory, the Court will not second-guess legislative judgment about their importance in comparison \nwith related burdens on interstate commerce.” Raymond, supra at 434 U.S. at 449. Those who would \nchallenge such bona fide safety regulations must overcome a “strong presumption of validity.” Bibb v. \nNavajo Freight Lines, Inc., 359 U.S. 520 at (1959). \nBut the incantation of a purpose to promote the public health or safety does not insulate a state law from \nCommerce Clause attack. Regulations designed for that salutary purpose nevertheless may further the \npurpose so marginally, and interfere with commerce so substantially, as to be invalid under the \nCommerce Clause. In the Court’s recent unanimous decision in Raymond we declined to “accept the \nState’s contention that the inquiry under the Commerce Clause is ended without a weighing of the \nasserted safety purpose against the degree of interference with interstate commerce.” This “weighing” by a \ncourt requires—and indeed the constitutionality of the state regulation depends on—“a sensitive \nconsideration of the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern in light of the extent of the burden \nimposed on the course of interstate commerce.” Id. at 434 U.S. at 441; accord, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., \n397 U.S. 137 at 142 (1970);Bibb, supra, at 359 U.S. at 525-530. \n \nIII \nApplying these general principles, we conclude that the Iowa truck length limitations unconstitutionally \nburden interstate commerce. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n183 \nIn Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, the Court held that a Wisconsin statute that precluded \nthe use of 65-foot doubles violated the Commerce Clause. This case is Raymond revisited. Here, as \nin Raymond, the State failed to present any persuasive evidence that 65-foot doubles are less safe than 55-\nfoot singles. Moreover, Iowa’s law is now out of step with the laws of all other Midwestern and Western \nStates. Iowa thus substantially burdens the interstate flow of goods by truck. In the absence of \ncongressional action to set uniform standards, some burdens associated with state safety regulations must \nbe tolerated. But where, as here, the State’s safety interest has been found to be illusory, and its \nregulations impair significantly the federal interest in efficient and safe interstate transportation, the state \nlaw cannot be harmonized with the Commerce Clause. \n \n \n \nA \nIowa made a more serious effort to support the safety rationale of its law than did Wisconsin in Raymond, \nbut its effort was no more persuasive. As noted above, the District Court found that the “evidence clearly \nestablishes that the twin is as safe as the semi.” The record supports this finding. The trial focused on a \ncomparison of the performance of the two kinds of trucks in various safety categories. The evidence \nshowed, and the District Court found, that the 65-foot double was at least the equal of the 55-foot single in \nthe ability to brake, turn, and maneuver. The double, because of its axle placement, produces less splash \nand spray in wet weather. And, because of its articulation in the middle, the double is less susceptible to \ndangerous “off-tracking,” and to wind. \n \nNone of these findings is seriously disputed by Iowa. Indeed, the State points to only three ways in which \nthe 55-foot single is even arguably superior: singles take less time to be passed and to clear intersections; \nthey may back up for longer distances; and they are somewhat less likely to jackknife. \n \nThe first two of these characteristics are of limited relevance on modern interstate highways. As the \nDistrict Court found, the negligible difference in the time required to pass, and to cross intersections, is \ninsignificant on 4-lane divided highways, because passing does not require crossing into oncoming traffic \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n184 \nlanes, Raymond, 434 U.S. at 444, and interstates have few, if any, intersections.

Washington Apple Advertising Commission \nHunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Commission \n432 U.S. 33 (U.S. Supreme Court 1977) \n \nMR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court. \n \nIn 1973, North Carolina enacted a statute which required, inter alia, all closed containers of apples sold, \noffered for sale, or shipped into the State to bear “no grade other than the applicable U.S. grade or \nstandard.”…Washington State is the Nation’s largest producer of apples, its crops accounting for \napproximately 30% of all apples grown domestically and nearly half of all apples shipped in closed \ncontainers in interstate commerce. [Because] of the importance of the apple industry to the State, its \nlegislature has undertaken to protect and enhance the reputation of Washington apples by establishing a \nstringent, mandatory inspection program [that] requires all apples shipped in interstate commerce to be \ntested under strict quality standards and graded accordingly. In all cases, the Washington State grades \n[are] the equivalent of, or superior to, the comparable grades and standards adopted by the [U.S. Dept. of] \nAgriculture (USDA). \n \n[In] 1972, the North Carolina Board of Agriculture adopted an administrative regulation, unique in the 50 \nStates, which in effect required all closed containers of apples shipped into or sold in the State to display \neither the applicable USDA grade or a notice indicating no classification. State grades were expressly \nprohibited. In addition to its obvious consequence—prohibiting the display of Washington State apple \ngrades on containers of apples shipped into North Carolina—the regulation presented the Washington \napple industry with a marketing problem of potentially nationwide significance. Washington apple \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n187 \ngrowers annually ship in commerce approximately 40 million closed containers of apples, nearly 500,000 \nof which eventually find their way into North Carolina, stamped with the applicable Washington State \nvariety and grade. [Compliance] with North Carolina’s unique regulation would have required \nWashington growers to obliterate the printed labels on containers shipped to North Carolina, thus giving \ntheir product a damaged appearance. Alternatively, they could have changed their marketing practices to \naccommodate the needs of the North Carolina market, i.e., repack apples to be shipped to North Carolina \nin containers bearing only the USDA grade, and/or store the estimated portion of the harvest destined for \nthat market in such special containers. As a last resort, they could discontinue the use of the preprinted \ncontainers entirely. None of these costly and less efficient options was very attractive to the industry. \nMoreover, in the event a number of other States followed North Carolina’s lead, the resultant inability to \ndisplay the Washington grades could force the Washington growers to abandon the State’s expensive \ninspection and grading system which their customers had come to know and rely on over the 60-odd \nyears of its existence.… \n \nUnsuccessful in its attempts to secure administrative relief [with North Carolina], the Commission \ninstituted this action challenging the constitutionality of the statute. [The] District Court found that the \nNorth Carolina statute, while neutral on its face, actually discriminated against Washington State growers \nand dealers in favor of their local counterparts [and] concluded that this discrimination [was] not justified \nby the asserted local interest—the elimination of deception and confusion from the marketplace—arguably \nfurthered by the [statute]. \n \n… \n \n[North Carolina] maintains that [the] burdens on the interstate sale of Washington apples were far \noutweighed by the local benefits flowing from what they contend was a valid exercise of North Carolina’s \n[police powers]. Prior to the statute’s enactment,…apples from 13 different States were shipped into North \nCarolina for sale. Seven of those States, including [Washington], had their own grading systems which, \nwhile differing in their standards, used similar descriptive labels (e.g., fancy, extra fancy, etc.). This",

Such \n“downgrading” offers the North Carolina apple industry the very sort of protection against competing out-\nof-state products that the Commerce Clause was designed to prohibit. At worst, it will have the effect of an \nembargo against those Washington apples in the superior grades as Washington dealers withhold them \nfrom the North Carolina market. At best, it will deprive Washington sellers of the market premium that \nsuch apples would otherwise command. \n \nDespite the statute’s facial neutrality, the Commission suggests that its discriminatory impact on \ninterstate commerce was not an unintended by-product, and there are some indications in the record to \nthat effect. The most glaring is the response of the North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner to the \nCommission’s request for an exemption following the statute’s passage in which he indicated that before \nhe could support such an exemption, he would “want to have the sentiment from our apple \nproducers since they were mainly responsible for this legislation being passed.” [Moreover], we find it \nsomewhat suspect that North Carolina singled out only closed containers of apples, the very means by \nwhich apples are transported in commerce, to effectuate the statute’s ostensible consumer protection \npurpose when apples are not generally sold at retail in their shipping containers. However, we need not \nascribe an economic protection motive to the North Carolina Legislature to resolve this case; we conclude \nthat the challenged statute cannot stand insofar as it prohibits the display of Washington State grades \neven if enacted for the declared purpose of protecting consumers from deception and fraud in the \nmarketplace. \n… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n190 \n \nFinally, we note that any potential for confusion and deception created by the Washington grades was not \nof the type that led to the statute’s enactment. Since Washington grades are in all cases equal or superior \nto their USDA counterparts, they could only “deceive” or “confuse” a consumer to his benefit, hardly a \nharmful result. \n \nIn addition, it appears that nondiscriminatory alternatives to the outright ban of Washington State grades \nare readily available. For example, North Carolina could effectuate its goal by permitting out-of-state \ngrowers to utilize state grades only if they also marked their shipments with the applicable USDA label. In \nthat case, the USDA grade would serve as a benchmark against which the consumer could evaluate the \nquality of the various state grades.… \n \n[The court affirmed the lower court’s holding that the North Carolina statute was unconstitutional.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

An electioneering communication is \ndefined as “any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication” that “refers to a clearly identified candidate \nfor Federal office” and is made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. §434(f)(3)(A). \nThe Federal Election Commission’s (FEC) regulations further define an electioneering communication as \na communication that is “publicly distributed.” 11 CFR §100.29(a)(2) (2009). “In the case of a candidate \nfor nomination for President…publicly distributed means” that the communication “[c]an be received by \n50,000 or more persons in a State where a primary election…is being held within 30 days.” 11 CFR \n§100.29(b)(3)(ii). Corporations and unions are barred from using their general treasury funds for express \nadvocacy or electioneering communications. They may establish, however, a “separate segregated fund” \n(known as a political action committee, or PAC) for these purposes. 2 U.S.C. §441b(b)(2).

Section 441b makes it a felony for all \ncorporations—including nonprofit advocacy corporations—either to expressly advocate the election or \ndefeat of candidates or to broadcast electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election \nand 60 days of a general election. Thus, the following acts would all be felonies under §441b: The Sierra \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n194 \nClub runs an ad, within the crucial phase of 60 days before the general election, that exhorts the public to \ndisapprove of a Congressman who favors logging in national forests; the National Rifle Association \npublishes a book urging the public to vote for the challenger because the incumbent U.S. Senator supports \na handgun ban; and the American Civil Liberties Union creates a Web site telling the public to vote for a \nPresidential candidate in light of that candidate’s defense of free speech. These prohibitions are classic \nexamples of censorship. \n \nSection 441b is a ban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation \ncan still speak. PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to administer and subject to \nextensive regulations. For example, every PAC must appoint a treasurer, forward donations to the \ntreasurer promptly, keep detailed records of the identities of the persons making donations, preserve \nreceipts for three years, and file an organization statement and report changes to this information within \n10 days. \n \nAnd that is just the beginning. PACs must file detailed monthly reports with the FEC, which are due at \ndifferent times depending on the type of election that is about to occur.… \n \nPACs have to comply with these regulations just to speak. This might explain why fewer than 2,000 of the \nmillions of corporations in this country have PACs. PACs, furthermore, must exist before they can speak. \nGiven the onerous restrictions, a corporation may not be able to establish a PAC in time to make its views \nknown regarding candidates and issues in a current campaign. \nSection 441b’s prohibition on corporate independent expenditures is thus a ban on speech. As a \n“restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a \ncampaign,” that statute “necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues \ndiscussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. \n1 at 19 (1976).… \n \nSpeech is an essential mechanism of democracy, for it is the means to hold officials accountable to the \npeople. See Buckley, supra, at 14–15 (“In a republic where the people are sovereign, the ability of the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n195 \ncitizenry to make informed choices among candidates for office is essential.”) The right of citizens to \ninquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach consensus is a precondition to enlightened self-\ngovernment and a necessary means to protect it. The First Amendment “‘has its fullest and most urgent \napplication’ to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.” \n \nFor these reasons, political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by design or \ninadvertence. Laws that burden political speech are “subject to strict scrutiny,” which requires the \nGovernment to prove that the restriction “furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to \nachieve that interest.” \n \n… \n \nThe Court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. This protection has \nbeen extended by explicit holdings to the context of political speech. Under the rationale of these \nprecedents, political speech does not lose First Amendment protection “simply because its source is a \ncorporation.” Bellotti, supra, at 784. The Court has thus rejected the argument that political speech of \ncorporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply \nbecause such associations are not “natural persons.” \n \nThe purpose and effect of this law is to prevent corporations, including small and nonprofit corporations,",

This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves. \n \nWhat we have said also shows the invalidity of other arguments made by the Government. For the most \npart relinquishing the anti-distortion rationale, the Government falls back on the argument that corporate \npolitical speech can be banned in order to prevent corruption or its appearance.… \n \nWhen Congress finds that a problem exists, we must give that finding due deference; but Congress may \nnot choose an unconstitutional remedy. If elected officials succumb to improper influences from \nindependent expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put expediency before \nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern. We must give weight to attempts by Congress to seek to \ndispel either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law, however, \nmust comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is \nthe governing rule. An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical preelection period is \nnot a permissible remedy. Here Congress has created categorical bans on speech that are asymmetrical to \npreventing quid pro quo corruption. \n \nOur precedent is to be respected unless the most convincing of reasons demonstrates that adherence to it \nputs us on a course that is sure error. “Beyond workability, the relevant factors in deciding whether to \nadhere to the principle of stare decisis include the antiquity of the precedent, the reliance interests at \nstake, and of course whether the decision was well reasoned.” [citing prior cases] \n \nThese considerations counsel in favor of rejecting Austin, which itself contravened this Court’s earlier \nprecedents in Buckley and Bellotti. “This Court has not hesitated to overrule decisions offensive to the \nFirst Amendment.” WRTL, 551 U.S., at 500 (opinion of Scalia, J.). “[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n197 \nand not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.” Helvering v.

See Smoodin, \n“Compulsory” Viewing for Every Citizen: Mr. Smith and the Rhetoric of Reception, 35 Cinema Journal 3, \n19, and n. 52 (Winter 1996) (citing Mr. Smith Riles Washington, Time, Oct. 30, 1939, p. 49); Nugent, \nCapra’s Capitol Offense, N. Y. Times, Oct. 29, 1939, p. X5. Under Austin, though, officials could have done \nmore than discourage its distribution—they could have banned the film.

Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington may be fiction and caricature; but fiction and caricature can be a powerful force. \n \nModern day movies, television comedies, or skits on YouTube.com might portray public officials or public \npolicies in unflattering ways.

Constitution sets the framework for all other laws of the United States, at both the federal and the \nstate level. It creates a shared balance of power between states and the federal government (federalism) \nand shared power among the branches of government (separation of powers), establishes individual rights \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n200 \nagainst governmental action (Bill of Rights), and provides for federal oversight of matters affecting \ninterstate commerce and commerce with foreign nations. Knowing the contours of the US legal system is \nnot possible without understanding the role of the US Constitution. \n \nThe Constitution is difficult to amend. Thus when the Supreme Court uses its power of judicial review to \ndetermine that a law is unconstitutional, it actually shapes what the Constitution means. New meanings \nthat emerge must do so by the process of amendment or by the passage of time and new appointments to \nthe court. Because justices serve for life, the court changes its philosophical outlook slowly. \n \nThe Bill of Rights is an especially important piece of the Constitutional framework. It provides legal \ncauses of action for infringements of individual rights by government, state or federal. Through the due \nprocess clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, both procedural and (to some \nextent) substantive due process rights are given to individuals. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. For many years, the Supreme Court believed that “commercial speech” was entitled to less protection \nthan other forms of speech. One defining element of commercial speech is that its dominant theme is \nto propose a commercial transaction. This kind of speech is protected by the First Amendment, but the \ngovernment is permitted to regulate it more closely than other forms of speech. However, the \ngovernment must make reasonable distinctions, must narrowly tailor the rules restricting commercial \nspeech, and must show that government has a legitimate goal that the law furthers. \nEdward Salib owned a Winchell’s Donut House in Mesa, Arizona. To attract customers, he displayed \nlarge signs in store windows. The city ordered him to remove the signs because they violated the city’s \nsign code, which prohibited covering more than 30 percent of a store’s windows with signs. Salib sued, \nclaiming that the sign code violated his First Amendment rights. What was the result, and why? \n2. Jennifer is a freshman at her local public high school.

Every day, business must deal with rules and decisions of state \nand federal administrative agencies. Informally, such rules are often called regulations, and they \ndiffer (only in their source) from laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. The \nrules created by agencies are voluminous: thousands of new regulations pour forth each year. The \noverarching question of whether there is too much regulation—or the wrong kind of regulation—of \nour economic activities is an important one but well beyond the scope of this chapter, in which we \noffer an overview of the purpose of administrative agencies, their structure, and their impact on \nbusiness. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n205 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5.1 Administrative Agencies: Their Structure and Powers \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain the reasons why we have federal administrative agencies. \n2. Explain the difference between executive branch agencies and independent agencies. \n3. Describe the constitutional issue that questions whether administrative agencies could have authority to \nmake enforceable rules that affect business. \n \n \nWhy Have Administrative Agencies? \nThe US Constitution mentions only three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial \n(Articles I, II, and III). There is no mention of agencies in the Constitution, even though federal agencies \nare sometimes referred to as “the fourth branch of government.” The Supreme Court has recognized the \nlegitimacy of federal administrative agencies to make rules that have the same binding effect as \nstatutes by Congress. \n \nMost commentators note that having agencies with rule-making power is a practical necessity: (1) \nCongress does not have the expertise or continuity to develop specialized knowledge in various areas (e.g., \ncommunications, the environment, aviation). (2) Because of this, it makes sense for Congress to set forth \nbroad statutory guidance to an agency and delegate authority to the agency to propose rules that further \nthe statutory purposes. (3) As long as Congress makes this delegating guidance sufficiently clear, it is not \ndelegating improperly. If Congress’s guidelines are too vague or undefined, it is (in essence) giving away \nits constitutional power to some other group, and this it cannot do. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n206 \nWhy Regulate the Economy at All? \nThe market often does not work properly, as economists often note.

Monopolies, for example, happen in \nthe natural course of human events but are not always desirable. To fix this, well-conceived and \nobjectively enforced competition law (what is called antitrust law in the United States) is needed. \n \nNegative externalities must be “fixed,” as well. For example, as we see in tort law (Chapter 7 \"Introduction \nto Tort Law\"), people and business organizations often do things that impose costs (damages) on others, \nand the legal system will try—through the award of compensatory damages—to make fair adjustments. In \nterms of the ideal conditions for a free market, think of tort law as the legal system’s attempt to \ncompensate for negative externalities: those costs imposed on people who have not voluntarily consented \nto bear those costs. \n \nIn terms of freedoms to enter or leave the market, the US constitutional guarantees of equal protection \ncan prevent local, state, and federal governments from imposing discriminatory rules for commerce that \nwould keep minorities, women, and gay people from full participation in business. For example, if the \nsmall town of Xenophobia, Colorado, passed a law that required all business owners and their employees \nto be Christian, heterosexual, and married, the equal protection clause (as well as numerous state and \nfederal equal opportunity employment laws) would empower plaintiffs to go to court and have the law \nstruck down as unconstitutional. \n \nKnowing that information is power, we will see many laws administered by regulatory agencies that seek \nto level the playing field of economic competition by requiring disclosure of the most pertinent \ninformation for consumers (consumer protection laws), investors (securities laws), and citizens (e.g., the \ntoxics release inventory laws in environmental law). \n \nIdeal Conditions for a Free Market \n1. There are many buyers and many sellers, and none of them has a substantial share of the market. \n2. All buyers and sellers in the market are free to enter the market or leave it. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n207 \n3. All buyers and all sellers have full and perfect knowledge of what other buyers and sellers are up to, \nincluding knowledge of prices, quantity, and quality of all goods being bought or sold. \n4. The goods being sold in the market are similar enough to each other that participants do not have \nstrong preferences as to which seller or buyer they deal with. \n5. The costs and benefits of making or using the goods that are exchanged in the market are borne only by \nthose who buy or sell those goods and not by third parties or people “external” to the market \ntransaction. (That is, there are no “externalities.”) \n6. All buyers and sellers are utility maximizers; each participant in the market tries to get as much as \npossible for as little as possible. \n7. There are no parties, institutions, or governmental units regulating the price, quantity, or quality of any \nof the goods being bought and sold in the market. \n \n \nIn short, some forms of legislation and regulation are needed to counter a tendency toward consolidation \nof economic power and discriminatory attitudes toward certain individuals and groups and to insist that \npeople and companies clean up their own messes and not hide information that would empower voluntary \nchoices in the free market. \n \nBut there are additional reasons to regulate. For example, in economic systems, it is likely for natural \nmonopolies to occur. These are where one firm can most efficiently supply all of the good or service. \nHaving duplicate (or triplicate) systems for supplying electricity, for example, would be inefficient, so \nmost states have a public utilities commission to determine both price and quality of service. This is direct \nregulation. \n \nSometimes destructive competition can result if there is no regulation. Banking and insurance are good \nexamples of this. Without government regulation of banks (setting standards and methods), open and \nfierce competition would result in widespread bank failures. That would erode public confidence in banks \nand business generally. The current situation (circa 2011) of six major banks that are “too big to fail” is, \nhowever, an example of destructive noncompetition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n208 \n \nOther market imperfections can yield a demand for regulation. For example, there is a need to regulate \nfrequencies for public broadcast on radio, television, and other wireless transmissions (for police, fire, \nnational defense, etc.). Many economists would also list an adequate supply of public goods as something \nthat must be created by government. On its own, for example, the market would not provide public goods",

These would include making enforceable \ncontracts for the sale and purchase of persons (slavery), sexual services, “street drugs” such as heroin or \ncrack cocaine, votes for public office, grades for this course in business law, and even marriage \npartnership. \n \nThus the free market in actual terms—and not in theory—consists of commerce legally constrained by \nwhat is economically desirable and by what is socially desirable as well. Public policy objectives in the \nsocial arena include ensuring equal opportunity in employment, protecting employees from unhealthy or \nunsafe work environments, preserving environmental quality and resources, and protecting consumers \nfrom unsafe products. Sometimes these objectives are met by giving individuals statutory rights that can \nbe used in bringing a complaint (e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for employment \ndiscrimination), and sometimes they are met by creating agencies with the right to investigate and \nmonitor and enforce statutory law and regulations created to enforce such law (e.g., the Environmental \nProtection Agency, for bringing a lawsuit against a polluting company). \n \nHistory of Federal Agencies \nThrough the commerce clause in the US Constitution, Congress has the power to regulate trade between \nthe states and with foreign nations. The earliest federal agency therefore dealt with trucking and railroads, \nto literally set the rules of the road for interstate commerce. The first federal agency, the Interstate \nCommerce Commission (ICC), was created in 1887. Congress delegated to the ICC the power to enforce \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n209 \nfederal laws against railroad rate discrimination and other unfair pricing practices. By the early part of \nthis century, the ICC gained the power to fix rates. From the 1970s through 1995, however, Congress \npassed deregulatory measures, and the ICC was formally abolished in 1995, with its powers transferred to \nthe Surface Transportation Board. \n \nBeginning with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914, Congress has created numerous other \nagencies, many of them familiar actors in American government. Today more than eighty-five federal \nagencies have jurisdiction to regulate some form of private activity. Most were created since 1930, and \nmore than a third since 1960. A similar growth has occurred at the state level. Most states now have \ndozens of regulatory agencies, many of them overlapping in function with the federal bodies. \n \nClassification of Agencies \nIndependent agencies are different from federal executive departments and other executive agencies by \ntheir structural and functional characteristics. Most executive departments have a single director, \nadministrator, or secretary appointed by the president of the United States. Independent agencies almost \nalways have a commission or board consisting of five to seven members who share power over the agency. \nThe president appoints the commissioners or board subject to Senate confirmation, but they often serve \nwith staggered terms and often for longer terms than a usual four-year presidential term. They cannot be \nremoved except for “good cause.” This means that most presidents will not get to appoint all the \ncommissioners of a given independent agency. Most independent agencies have a statutory requirement \nof bipartisan membership on the commission, so the president cannot simply fill vacancies with members \nof his own political party. \n \nIn addition to the ICC and the FTC, the major independent agencies are the Federal Communications \nCommission (1934), Securities and Exchange Commission (1934), National Labor Relations Board (1935), \nand Environmental Protection Agency (1970).

One consequence of this distinction is that the rules that \nindependent agencies promulgate may not be reviewed by the president or his staff—only Congress may \ndirectly overrule them—whereas the White House or officials in the various cabinet departments may \noversee the work of the agencies contained within them (unless specifically denied the power by \nCongress). \n \nPowers of Agencies \nAgencies have a variety of powers. Many of the original statutes that created them, like the Federal \nCommunications Act, gave them licensing power. No party can enter into the productive activity covered \nby the act without prior license from the agency—for example, no utility can start up a nuclear power \nplant unless first approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In recent years, the move toward \nderegulation of the economy has led to diminution of some licensing power. Many agencies also have the \nauthority to set the rates charged by companies subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. Finally, the agencies \ncan regulate business practices. The FTC has general jurisdiction over all business in interstate commerce \nto monitor and root out “unfair acts” and “deceptive practices.” The Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC) oversees the issuance of corporate securities and other investments and monitors the practices of \nthe stock exchanges. \n \nUnlike courts, administrative agencies are charged with the responsibility of carrying out a specific \nassignment or reaching a goal or set of goals. They are not to remain neutral on the various issues of the \nday; they must act. They have been given legislative powers because in a society growing ever more \ncomplex, Congress does not know how to legislate with the kind of detail that is necessary, nor would it \nhave the time to approach all the sectors of society even if it tried. Precisely because they are to do what \ngeneral legislative bodies cannot do, agencies are specialized bodies. Through years of experience in \ndealing with similar problems they accumulate a body of knowledge that they can apply to accomplish \ntheir statutory duties. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n211 \nAll administrative agencies have two different sorts of personnel. The heads, whether a single \nadministrator or a collegial body of commissioners, are political appointees and serve for relatively \nlimited terms. Below them is a more or less permanent staff—the bureaucracy. Much policy making \noccurs at the staff level, because these employees are in essential control of gathering facts and presenting \ndata and argument to the commissioners, who wield the ultimate power of the agencies. \n \nThe Constitution and Agencies \nCongress can establish an agency through legislation. When Congress gives powers to an agency, the \nlegislation is known as an enabling act. The concept that Congress can delegate power to an agency is \nknown as the delegation doctrine. Usually, the agency will have all three kinds of power: executive, \nlegislative, and judicial. (That is, the agency can set the rules that business must comply with, can \ninvestigate and prosecute those businesses, and can hold administrative hearings for violations of those \nrules. They are, in effect, rule maker, prosecutor, and judge.) Because agencies have all three types of \ngovernmental powers, important constitutional questions were asked when Congress first created them. \nThe most important question was whether Congress was giving away its legislative power. Was the \nseparation of powers violated if agencies had power to make rules that were equivalent to legislative \nstatutes? \n \nIn 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court overturned the National \nIndustrial Recovery Act on the ground that the congressional delegation of power was too broad. [1] Under \nthe law, industry trade groups were granted the authority to devise a code of fair competition for the \nentire industry, and these codes became law if approved by the president. No administrative body was \ncreated to scrutinize the arguments for a particular code, to develop evidence, or to test one version of a \ncode against another. Thus it was unconstitutional for the Congress to transfer all of its legislative powers",

Because this is a time-\nconsuming process that runs counter to the reason for creating administrative bodies, it happens rarely. \nAnother approach to controlling agencies is to reduce or threaten to reduce their appropriations. By \nretaining ultimate control of the purse strings, Congress can exercise considerable informal control over \nregulatory policy. \n \nExecutive Control \nThe president (or a governor, for state agencies) can exercise considerable control over agencies that are \npart of his cabinet departments and that are not statutorily defined as independent. Federal agencies, \nmoreover, are subject to the fiscal scrutiny of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), subject to the \ndirect control of the president. Agencies are not permitted to go directly to Congress for increases in \nbudget; these requests must be submitted through the OMB, giving the president indirect leverage over \nthe continuation of administrators’ programs and policies. \n \nJudicial Review of Agency Actions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n215 \nAdministrative agencies are creatures of law and like everyone else must obey the law. The courts have \njurisdiction to hear claims that the agencies have overstepped their legal authority or have acted in some \nunlawful manner. \n \nCourts are unlikely to overturn administrative actions, believing in general that the agencies are better \nsituated to judge their own jurisdiction and are experts in rulemaking for those matters delegated to them \nby Congress. Some agency activities are not reviewable, for a number of reasons. However, after a \nbusiness (or some other interested party) has exhausted all administrative remedies, it may seek judicial \nreview of a final agency decision. The reviewing court is often asked to strike down or modify agency \nactions on several possible bases (see Section 5.5.2 \"Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review\" on \n“Strategies for Obtaining Judicial Review”). \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nAdministrative agencies are given unusual powers: to legislate, investigate, and adjudicate. But these powers \nare limited by executive and legislative controls and by judicial review. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Find the website of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

Understand how the act affects rulemaking by agencies. \n \n \nIn 1946, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). This fundamental statute \ndetailed for all federal administrative agencies how they must function when they are deciding cases \nor issuing regulations, the two basic tasks of administration. At the state level, the Model State \nAdministrative Procedure Act, issued in 1946 and revised in 1961, has been adopted in twenty-eight \nstates and the District of Columbia; three states have adopted the 1981 revision. The other states \nhave statutes that resemble the model state act to some degree. \n \nTrial-Type Hearings \nDeciding cases is a major task of many agencies. For example, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is \nempowered to charge a company with having violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. Perhaps a seller \nis accused of making deceptive claims in its advertising. Proceeding in a manner similar to a court, staff \ncounsel will prepare a case against the company, which can defend itself through its lawyers. The case is \ntried before an administrative law judge (ALJ), formerly known as an administrative hearing \nexaminer. The change in nomenclature was made in 1972 to enhance the prestige of ALJs and more \naccurately reflect their duties. Although not appointed for life as federal judges are, the ALJ must be free \nof assignments inconsistent with the judicial function and is not subject to supervision by anyone in the \nagency who carries on an investigative or prosecutorial function. \nThe accused parties are entitled to receive notice of the issues to be raised, to present evidence, to argue, \nto cross-examine, and to appear with their lawyers.

Describe the paperwork burden imposed by administrative agencies. \n2. Explain why agencies have the power of investigation, and what limits there are to that power. \n3. Explain the need for the Freedom of Information Act and how it works in the US legal system. \n \n \nThe Paperwork Burden \nThe administrative process is not frictionless. The interplay between government agency and private \nenterprise can burden business operations in a number of ways. Several of these are noted in this section. \n \nDeciding whether and how to act are not decisions that government agencies reach out of the blue. They \nrely heavily on information garnered from business itself. Dozens of federal agencies require corporations \nto keep hundreds of types of records and to file numerous periodic reports. The Commission on Federal \nPaperwork, established during the Ford administration to consider ways of reducing the paperwork \nburden, estimated in its final report in 1977 that the total annual cost of federal paperwork amounted to \n$50 billion and that the 10,000 largest business enterprises spent $10 billion annually on paperwork \nalone. The paperwork involved in licensing a single nuclear power plant, the commission said, costs \nupward of $15 million. \n \nNot surprisingly, therefore, businesses have sought ways of avoiding requests for data. Since the 1940s, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has collected economic data on corporate performance from \nindividual companies for statistical purposes. As long as each company engages in a single line of \nbusiness, data are comparable. When the era of conglomerates began in the 1970s, with widely divergent \ntypes of businesses brought together under the roof of a single corporate parent, the data became useless \nfor purposes of examining the competitive behavior of different industries. So the FTC ordered dozens of \nlarge companies to break out their economic information according to each line of business that they \ncarried on. The companies resisted, but the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nwhere much of the litigation over federal administrative action is decided, directed the companies to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n220 \ncomply with the commission’s order, holding that the Federal Trade Commission Act clearly permits the \nagency to collect information for investigatory purposes. [1] \n \nIn 1980, responding to cries that businesses, individuals, and state and local governments were being \nswamped by federal demands for paperwork, Congress enacted the Paperwork Reduction Act. It gives \npower to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop uniform policies for \ncoordinating the gathering, storage, and transmission of all the millions of reports flowing in each year to \nthe scores of federal departments and agencies requesting information. These reports include tax and \nMedicare forms, financial loan and job applications, questionnaires of all sorts, compliance reports, and \ntax and business records. The OMB was given the power also to determine whether new kinds of \ninformation are needed. In effect, any agency that wants to collect new information from outside must \nobtain the OMB’s approval. \n \nInspections \nNo one likes surprise inspections. A section of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 empowers \nagents of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to search work areas for safety \nhazards and for violations of OSHA regulations. The act does not specify whether inspectors are required \nto obtain search warrants, required under the Fourth Amendment in criminal cases. For many years, the \ngovernment insisted that surprise inspections are not unreasonable and that the time required to obtain a \nwarrant would defeat the surprise element. The Supreme Court finally ruled squarely on the issue in 1978. \nIn Marshall v. Barlow’s, Inc., the court held that no less than private individuals, businesses are entitled \nto refuse police demands to search the premises unless a court has issued a search warrant. [2] \n \nBut where a certain type of business is closely regulated, surprise inspections are the norm, and no \nwarrant is required. For example, businesses with liquor licenses that might sell to minors are subject to \nboth overt and covert inspections (e.g., an undercover officer may “search” a liquor store by sending an",

            "chunk": "general manager, Ferrol G. “Bill” Barlow, was on hand; and the OSHA inspector, after showing his \ncredentials, informed Mr. Barlow that he wished to conduct a search of the working areas of the business. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n229 \nMr. Barlow inquired whether any complaint had been received about his company. The inspector \nanswered no, but that Barlow’s, Inc., had simply turned up in the agency’s selection process. The inspector \nagain asked to enter the nonpublic area of the business; Mr. Barlow’s response was to inquire whether the \ninspector had a search warrant. \nThe inspector had none. Thereupon, Mr. Barlow refused the inspector admission to the employee area of \nhis business. He said he was relying on his rights as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment of the United \nStates Constitution. \n \nThree months later, the Secretary petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Idaho to \nissue an order compelling Mr. Barlow to admit the inspector. The requested order was issued on \nDecember 30, 1975, and was presented to Mr. Barlow on January 5, 1976. Mr. Barlow again refused \nadmission, and he sought his own injunctive relief against the warrantless searches assertedly permitted \nby OSHA.…The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as \nprivate homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the American colonial \nexperience. \n \nAn important forerunner of the first 10 Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Virginia Bill of \nRights, specifically opposed “general warrants, whereby an officer or messenger may be commanded to \nsearch suspected places without evidence of a fact committed.” The general warrant was a recurring point \nof contention in the Colonies immediately preceding the Revolution. The particular offensiveness it \nengendered was acutely felt by the merchants and businessmen whose premises and products were \ninspected for compliance with the several parliamentary revenue measures that most irritated the \ncolonists.… \n \n* * * \n \nThis Court has already held that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable, and that this rule \napplies to commercial premises as well as homes. In Camara v. Municipal Court, we held: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n230 \n[E]xcept in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper \nconsent is ‘unreasonable’ unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. \n \nOn the same day, we also ruled: As we explained in Camara, a search of private houses is \npresumptively unreasonable if conducted without a warrant. The businessman, like the occupant \nof a residence, has a constitutional right to go about his business free from unreasonable official \nentries upon his private commercial property. The businessman, too, has that right placed in \njeopardy if the decision to enter and inspect for violation of regulatory laws can be made and \nenforced by the inspector in the field without official authority evidenced by a warrant. These \nsame cases also held that the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches \nprotects against warrantless intrusions during civil as well as criminal investigations. The \nreason is found in the “basic purpose of this Amendment…[which] is to safeguard the privacy and \nsecurity of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” If the government \nintrudes on a person’s property, the privacy interest suffers whether the government’s motivation \nis to investigate violations of criminal laws or breaches of other statutory or regulatory \nstandards.… \n \n[A]n exception from the search warrant requirement has been recognized for “pervasively regulated \nbusiness[es],” United States v. Biswell, 406 U.S. 311, 316 (1972), and for “closely regulated” industries \n“long subject to close supervision and inspection,” Colonnade Catering Corp. v. United States, 397 U.S. \n72, 74, 77 (1970). These cases are indeed exceptions, but they represent responses to relatively unique \ncircumstances. Certain industries have such a history of government oversight that no reasonable \nexpectation of privacy could exist for a proprietor over the stock of such an enterprise. Liquor \n(Colonnade) and firearms (Biswell) are industries of this type when an entrepreneur embarks upon such a \nbusiness, he has voluntarily chosen to subject himself to a full arsenal of governmental regulation. \n \n* * * \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n231 \nThe clear import of our cases is that the closely regulated industry of the type involved \nin Colonnade and Biswell is the exception.

In 1978, the Secretary, acting through the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated a standard limiting occupational \nexposure to cotton dust, an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton \nproducts, exposure to which produces a “constellation of respiratory effects” known as “byssinosis.” This \ndisease was one of the expressly recognized health hazards that led to passage of the Act. \n \nPetitioners in these consolidated cases representing the interests of the cotton industry, challenged the \nvalidity of the “Cotton Dust Standard” in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit \npursuant to § 6 (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. § 655 (f).

Respondents, the Secretary of Labor and two labor \norganizations, counter that Congress balanced the costs and benefits in the Act itself, and that the Act \nshould therefore be construed not to require OSHA to do so. They interpret the Act as mandating that \nOSHA enact the most protective standard possible to eliminate a significant risk of material health \nimpairment, subject to the constraints of economic and technological feasibility. \n \nThe Court of Appeals held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits. \n \nWe granted certiorari, 449 U.S. 817 (1980), to resolve this important question, which was presented but",

Explain how criminal law differs from civil law. \n2. Categorize the various types of crimes and define the most serious felonies. \n3. Discuss and question the criminal “intent” of a corporation. \n4. Explain basic criminal procedure and the rights of criminal defendants. \n \n \nAt times, unethical behavior by businesspeople can be extreme enough that society will respond by \ncriminalizing certain kinds of activities. Ponzi schemes, arson, various kinds of fraud, embezzlement, \nracketeering, foreign corrupt practices, tax evasion, and insider trading are just a few. A corporation \ncan face large fines, and corporate managers can face both fines and jail sentences for violating \ncriminal laws. This chapter aims to explain how criminal law differs from civil law, to discuss various \ntypes of crimes, and to relate the basic principles of criminal procedure. \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n241 \n6.1 The Nature of Criminal Law \n \nCriminal law is the most ancient branch of the law. Many wise observers have tried to define and \nexplain it, but the explanations often include many complex and subtle distinctions. A traditional \ncriminal law course would include a lot of discussions on criminal intent, the nature of criminal \nversus civil responsibility, and the constitutional rights accorded the accused. But in this chapter, we \nwill consider only the most basic aspects of intent, responsibility, and constitutional rights. \nUnlike civil actions, where plaintiffs seek compensation or other remedies for themselves, crimes \ninvolve “the state” (the federal government, a state government, or some subunit of state \ngovernment). This is because crimes involve some “harm to society” and not just harm to certain \nindividuals. But “harm to society” is not always evident in the act itself. For example, two friends of \nyours at a party argue, take the argument outside, and blows are struck; one has a bloody nose and \nimmediately goes home. The crimes of assault and battery have been committed, even though no one \nelse knows about the fight and the friends later make up. By contrast, suppose a major corporation \npublicly announces that it is closing operations in your community and moving operations to \nSoutheast Asia. There is plenty of harm to society as the plant closes down and no new jobs take the \nplace of the company’s jobs. Although the effects on society are greater in the second example, only \nthe first example is a crime. \n \nCrimes are generally defined by legislatures, in statutes; the statutes describe in general terms the \nnature of the conduct they wish to criminalize. For government punishment to be fair, citizens must \nhave clear notice of what is criminally prohibited. Ex post facto laws—laws created “after the fact” to \npunish an act that was legal at the time—are expressly prohibited by the US Constitution. Overly \nvague statutes can also be struck down by courts under a constitutional doctrine known as “void for \nvagueness.” \n \nWhat is considered a crime will also vary from society to society and from time to time. For example, \nwhile cocaine use was legal in the United States at one time, it is now a controlled substance, and \nunauthorized use is now a crime. Medical marijuana was not legal fifty years ago when its use began \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n242 \nto become widespread, and in some states its use or possession was a felony. Now, some states make \nit legal to use or possess it under some circumstances. In the United States, you can criticize and \nmake jokes about the president of the United States without committing a crime, but in many \ncountries it is a serious criminal act to criticize a public official. \nAttitudes about appropriate punishment for crimes will also vary considerably from nation to nation. \nUganda has decreed long prison sentences for homosexuals and death to repeat offenders. In Saudi \nArabia, the government has proposed to deliberately paralyze a criminal defendant who criminally \nassaulted someone and unintentionally caused the victim’s paralysis. Limits on punishment are set",

Other than deterring certain kinds of conduct, what purpose does the criminal law serve? \n2. Why is ignorance of the law no excuse? Why shouldn’t it be an excuse, when criminal laws can be \ncomplicated and sometimes ambiguous? \n \n \n \n \n6.2 Types of Crimes \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Categorize various types of crimes. \n2. Name and define the major felonies in criminal law. \n3. Explain how white-collar crime differs from other crimes. \n4. Define a variety of white-collar crimes. \n \n \nMost classifications of crime turn on the seriousness of the act. In general, seriousness is defined by the \nnature or duration of the punishment set out in the statute. A felony is a crime punishable (usually) by \nimprisonment of more than one year or by death. (Crimes punishable by death are sometimes known as \ncapital crimes; they are increasingly rare in the United States.) The major felonies include murder, rape, \nkidnapping, armed robbery, embezzlement, insider trading, fraud, and racketeering. All other crimes are \nusually known as misdemeanors, petty offenses, or infractions. Another way of viewing crimes is by the \ntype of social harm the statute is intended to prevent or deter, such as offenses against the person, \noffenses against property, and white-collar crime. \n \n \nOffenses against the Person \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n245 \nHomicide \nHomicide is the killing of one person by another. Not every killing is criminal. When the law permits one \nperson to kill another—for example, a soldier killing an enemy on the battlefield during war, or a killing in \nself-defense—the death is considered the result of justifiable homicide. An excusable homicide, by \ncontrast, is one in which death results from an accident in which the killer is not at fault. \n \nAll other homicides are criminal. The most severely punished form is murder, defined as homicide \ncommitted with “malice aforethought.” This is a term with a very long history. Boiled down to its \nessentials, it means that the defendant had the intent to kill. A killing need not be premeditated for any \nlong period of time; the premeditation might be quite sudden, as in a bar fight that escalates in that \nmoment when one of the fighters reaches for a knife with the intent to kill. \n \nSometimes a homicide can be murder even if there is no intent to kill; an intent to inflict great bodily \nharm can be murder if the result is the death of another person. A killing that takes place while a felony \n(such as armed robbery) is being committed is also murder, whether or not the killer intended any harm. \nThis is the so-called felony murder rule. Examples are the accidental discharge of a gun that kills an \ninnocent bystander or the asphyxiation death of a fireman from smoke resulting from a fire set by an \narsonist. The felony murder rule is more significant than it sounds, because it also applies to the \naccomplices of one who does the killing. Thus the driver of a getaway car stationed a block away from the \nscene of the robbery can be convicted of murder if a gun accidentally fires during the robbery and \nsomeone is killed. Manslaughter is an act of killing that does not amount to murder. Voluntary \nmanslaughter is an intentional killing, but one carried out in the “sudden heat of passion” as the result of \nsome provocation. An example is a fight that gets out of hand. Involuntary manslaughter entails a lesser \ndegree of willfulness; it usually occurs when someone has taken a reckless action that results in death \n(e.g., a death resulting from a traffic accident in which one driver recklessly runs a red light). \nAssault and Battery \nOrdinarily, we would say that a person who has struck another has “assaulted” him. Technically, that is \na battery—the unlawful application of force to another person. The force need not be violent. Indeed, a \nman who kisses a woman is guilty of a battery if he does it against her will. The other person may consent \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n246 \nto the force. That is one reason why surgeons require patients to sign consent forms, giving the doctor \npermission to operate. In the absence of such a consent, an operation is a battery. That is also why football \nplayers are not constantly being charged with battery. Those who agree to play football agree to submit to \nthe rules of the game, which of course include the right to tackle. But the consent does not apply to all acts \nof physical force: a hockey player who hits an opponent over the head with his stick can be prosecuted for \nthe crime of battery. \n \nCriminal assault is an attempt to commit a battery or the deliberate placing of another in fear of",

If you throw a rock at a friend, but he manages to dodge it, you have \ncommitted an assault. Some states limit an assault to an attempt to commit a battery by one who has a \n“present ability” to do so. Pointing an unloaded gun and threatening to shoot would not be an assault, nor, \nof course, could it be a battery. The modem tendency, however, is to define an assault as an attempt to \ncommit a battery by one with an apparent ability to do so. \n \nAssault and battery may be excused. For example, a bar owner (or her agent, the bouncer) may use \nreasonable force to remove an unruly patron. If the use of force is excessive, the bouncer can be found \nguilty of assault and battery, and a civil action could arise against the bar owner as well. \n \nOffenses against Property \nTheft: Larceny, Robbery, Embezzlement, False Pretenses \nThe concept of theft is familiar enough. Less familiar is the way the law has treated various aspects of the \nact of stealing. Criminal law distinguishes among many different crimes that are popularly known as theft. \nMany technical words have entered the language—burglary, larceny, robbery—but are often used \ninaccurately. Brief definitions of the more common terms are discussed here. \n \nThe basic crime of stealing personal property is larceny. By its old common-law definition, still in use \ntoday, larceny is the wrongful “taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to \nsteal the same.” \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n247 \nThe separate elements of this offense have given rise to all kinds of difficult cases. Take the theft of fruit, \nfor example, with regard to the essential element of “personal property.” If a man walking through an \norchard plucks a peach from a tree and eats it, he is not guilty of larceny because he has not taken away \npersonal property (the peach is part of the land, being connected to the tree). But if he picks up a peach \nlying on the ground, he is guilty of larceny. Or consider the element of “taking” or “carrying away.” \nSneaking into a movie theater without paying is not an act of larceny (though in most states it is a criminal \nact). Taking electricity by tapping into the power lines of an electric utility was something that baffled \njudges late in the nineteenth century because it was not clear whether electricity is a “something” that can \nbe taken. Modern statutes have tended to make clear that electricity can be the object of larceny. Or \nconsider the element of an “intent to steal the same.” If you borrow your friend’s BMW without his \npermission in order to go to the grocery store, intending to return it within a few minutes and then do \nreturn it, you have not committed larceny. But if you meet another friend at the store who convinces you \nto take a long joyride with the car and you return hours later, you may have committed larceny. \n \nA particular form of larceny is robbery, which is defined as larceny from a person by means of violence \nor intimidation. \n \nLarceny involves the taking of property from the possession of another. Suppose that a person legitimately \ncomes to possess the property of another and wrongfully appropriates it—for example, an automobile \nmechanic entrusted with your car refuses to return it, or a bank teller who is entitled to temporary \npossession of cash in his drawer takes it home with him. The common law had trouble with such cases \nbecause the thief in these cases already had possession; his crime was in assuming ownership. Today, \nsuch wrongful conversion, known as embezzlement, has been made a statutory offense in all states. \n \nStatutes against larceny and embezzlement did not cover all the gaps in the law. A conceptual problem \narises in the case of one who is tricked into giving up his title to property. In larceny and embezzlement, \nthe thief gains possession or ownership without any consent of the owner or custodian of the property. \nSuppose, however, that an automobile dealer agrees to take his customer’s present car as a trade-in. The \ncustomer says that he has full title to the car. In fact, the customer is still paying off an installment loan \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n248 \nand the finance company has an interest in the old car.

A common example is a salaried building inspector who \nrefuses to issue a permit unless the permittee pays him. Under modern statutes, the crime of extortion has \nbeen broadened to include the wrongful collection of money or something else of value by anyone by \nmeans of a threat (short of a threat of immediate physical violence, for such a threat would make the \ndemand an act of robbery). This kind of extortion is usually called blackmail. The blackmail threat \ncommonly is to expose some fact of the victim’s private life or to make a false accusation about him. \n \nOffenses against Habitation and Other Offenses \nBurglary \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n250 \nBurglary is not a crime against property. It is defined as “the breaking and entering of the dwelling of \nanother in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony.” The intent to steal is not an issue: a man who \nsneaks into a woman’s home intent on raping her has committed a burglary, even if he does not carry out \nthe act. The student doing critical thinking will no doubt notice that the definition provides plenty of room \nfor argument. What is “breaking”? (The courts do not require actual destruction; the mere opening of a \nclosed door, even if unlocked, is enough.) What is entry? When does night begin? What kind of intent? \nWhose dwelling? Can a landlord burglarize the dwelling of his tenant? (Yes.) Can a person burglarize his \nown home? (No.) \n \nArson \nUnder common law, arson was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Burning one’s own \nhouse for purposes of collecting insurance was not an act of arson under common law. The statutes today \nmake it a felony intentionally to set fire to any building, whether or not it is a dwelling and whether or not \nthe purpose is to collect insurance. \nBribery \nBribery is a corrupt payment (or receipt of such a payment) for official action. The payment can be in \ncash or in the form of any goods, intangibles, or services that the recipient would find valuable. Under \ncommon law, only a public official could be bribed. In most states, bribery charges can result from the \nbribe of anyone performing a public function. \n \nBribing a public official in government procurement (contracting) can result in serious criminal charges. \nBribing a public official in a foreign country to win a contract can result in charges under the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. \n \nPerjury \nPerjury is the crime of giving a false oath, either orally or in writing, in a judicial or other official \nproceeding (lies made in proceedings other than courts are sometimes termed “false swearing”). To be \nperjurious, the oath must have been made corruptly—that is, with knowledge that it was false or without \nsincere belief that it was true. An innocent mistake is not perjury. A statement, though true, is perjury if \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n251 \nthe maker of it believes it to be false. Statements such as “I don’t remember” or “to the best of my \nknowledge” are not sufficient to protect a person who is lying from conviction for perjury. To support a \ncharge of perjury, however, the false statement must be “material,” meaning that the statement is relevant \nto whatever the court is trying to find out. \n \nWhite-Collar Crime \nWhite-collar crime, as distinguished from “street crime,” refers generally to fraud-related acts carried \nout in a nonviolent way, usually connected with business. Armed bank robbery is not a white-collar crime, \nbut embezzlement by a teller or bank officer is. Many white-collar crimes are included within the statutory \ndefinitions of embezzlement and false pretenses. Most are violations of state law. Depending on how they \nare carried out, many of these same crimes are also violations of federal law. \n \nAny act of fraud in which the United States postal system is used or which involves interstate phone calls \nor Internet connections is a violation of federal law. Likewise, many different acts around the buying and \nselling of securities can run afoul of federal securities laws. Other white-collar crimes include tax fraud; \nprice fixing; violations of food, drug, and environmental laws; corporate bribery of foreign companies; \nand—the newest form—computer fraud. Some of these are discussed here; others are covered in later \nchapters. \n \nMail and Wire Fraud \nFederal law prohibits the use of the mails or any interstate electronic communications medium for the \npurpose of furthering a “scheme or artifice to defraud.” The statute is broad, and it is relatively easy for \nprosecutors to prove a violation. The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who",

The law also bans attempts to defraud, so the prosecutor need not show \nthat the scheme worked or that anyone suffered any losses. “Fraud” is broadly construed: anyone who \nuses the mails or telephone to defraud anyone else of virtually anything, not just of money, can be \nconvicted under the law.

For example, \nin a 2010 case, Allergen had to pay a criminal fine for marketing Botox as a headache or pain reliever, a \nuse that had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Unlike most criminal statutes, \nwillfulness or deliberate misconduct is not an element of the act. As the United States v. Park case \n(Section 6.7 \"Cases\") shows, an executive can be held criminally liable even though he may have had no \npersonal knowledge of the violation. \n \n \n \nEnvironmental Crimes \nMany federal environmental statutes have criminal provisions. These include the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Act (commonly called the Clean Water Act); the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (the Refuse Act); \nthe Clean Air Act; the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA); and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the Clean Water \nAct, for example, wrongful discharge of pollutants into navigable waters carries a fine ranging from \n$2,500 to $25,000 per day and imprisonment for up to one year. “Responsible corporate officers” are \nspecifically included as potential defendants in criminal prosecutions under the act. They can include \nofficers who have responsibility over a project where subcontractors and their employees actually caused \nthe discharge. [2] \n \nViolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nAs a byproduct of Watergate, federal officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal \nRevenue Service uncovered many instances of bribes paid by major corporations to officials of foreign \ngovernments to win contracts with those governments. Congress responded in 1977 with the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act, which imposed a stringent requirement that the disposition of assets be accurately \nand fairly accounted for in a company’s books and records. The act also made illegal the payment of bribes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n253 \nto foreign officials or to anyone who will transmit the money to a foreign official to assist the payor (the \none offering and delivering the money) in getting business. \n \nViolations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act \nIn 1970 Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), aimed at \nending organized crime’s infiltration into legitimate business. The act tells courts to construe its language \nbroadly “to effectuate its remedial purpose,” and many who are not part of organized crime have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted under the act. It bans a “pattern of racketeering,” defined as the commission of at \nleast two acts within ten years of any of a variety of already-existing crimes, including mail, wire, and \nsecurities fraud. The act thus makes many types of fraud subject to severe penalties. \nComputer Crime \nComputer crime generally falls into four categories: (1) theft of money, financial instruments, or \nproperty; (2) misappropriation of computer time; (3) theft of programs; and (4) illegal acquisition of \ninformation. The main federal statutory framework for many computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act (CFAA; see Table 6.1 \"Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\"). \nCongress only prohibited computer fraud and abuse where there was a federal interest, as where \ncomputers of the government were involved or where the crime was interstate in nature. \n \nTable 6.1 Summary of Provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act \nObtaining national security information \nSec.

How long a delay is too \nlong depends on the circumstances in each case. In 1975, Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give \npriority to criminal cases in federal courts. It requires all criminal prosecutions to go to trial within \nseventy-five days (though the law lists many permissible reasons for delay). \n \nCross-Examination \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n267 \nThe Sixth Amendment also says that the defendant shall have the right to confront witnesses against him. \nNo testimony is permitted to be shown to the jury unless the person making it is present and subject to \ncross-examination by the defendant’s counsel. \n \nAssistance of Counsel \nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to have the assistance of defense counsel. \nDuring the eighteenth century and before, the British courts frequently refused to permit defendants to \nhave lawyers in the courtroom during trial. The right to counsel is much broader in this country, as the \nresult of Supreme Court decisions that require the state to pay for a lawyer for indigent defendants in \nmost criminal cases. \n \nCruel and Unusual Punishment \nPunishment under the common law was frequently horrifying. Death was a common punishment for \nrelatively minor crimes. In many places throughout the world, punishments still persist that seem cruel \nand unusual, such as the practice of stoning someone to death. The guillotine, famously in use during and \nafter the French Revolution, is no longer used, nor are defendants put in stocks for public display and \nhumiliation. In pre-Revolutionary America, an unlucky defendant who found himself convicted could face \nbrutal torture before death. \n \nThe Eighth Amendment banned these actions with the words that “cruel and unusual punishments [shall \nnot be] inflicted.” Virtually all such punishments either never were enacted or have been eliminated from \nthe statute books in the United States. Nevertheless, the Eighth Amendment has become a source of \ncontroversy, first with the Supreme Court’s ruling in 1976 that the death penalty, as haphazardly applied \nin the various states, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Later Supreme Court opinions have \nmade it easier for states to administer the death penalty. As of 2010, there were 3,300 defendants on \ndeath row in the United States. Of course, no corporation is on death row, and no corporation’s charter \nhas ever been revoked by a US state, even though some corporations have repeatedly been indicted and \nconvicted of criminal offenses. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n268 \nPresumption of Innocence \nThe most important constitutional right in the US criminal justice system is the presumption of \ninnocence. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned lower courts in the United States that juries must \nbe properly instructed that the defendant is innocent until proven guilty. This is the origin of the “beyond \nall reasonable doubt” standard of proof and is an instruction given to juries in each criminal case. The \nFifth Amendment notes the right of “due process” in federal proceedings, and the Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires that each state provide “due process” to defendants. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe US Constitution provides several important protections for criminal defendants, including a prohibition on \nthe use of evidence that has been obtained by unconstitutional means. This would include evidence seized in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment and confessions obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Do you think it is useful to have a presumption of innocence in criminal cases? What if there were not a \npresumption of innocence in criminal cases? \n2. Do you think public humiliation, public execution, and unusual punishments would reduce the amount of \ncrime? Why do you think so? \n3. “Due process” is another phrase for “fairness.” Why should the public show fairness toward criminal \ndefendants? \n \n  \n \n[1] Miranda v.

He testified that, although all of Acme’s employees were in a \nsense under his general direction, the company had an “organizational structure for responsibilities for \ncertain functions” according to which different phases of its operation were “assigned to individuals who, \nin turn, have staff and departments under them.” He identified those individuals responsible for \nsanitation, and related that upon receipt of the January 1972 FDA letter, he had conferred with the vice \npresident for legal affairs, who informed him that the Baltimore division vice president “was investigating \nthe situation immediately and would be taking corrective action and would be preparing a summary of the \ncorrective action to reply to the letter.” Respondent stated that he did not “believe there was anything [he] \ncould have done more constructively than what [he] found was being done.” \n \nOn cross-examination, respondent conceded that providing sanitary conditions for food offered for sale to \nthe public was something that he was “responsible for in the entire operation of the company” and he \nstated that it was one of many phases of the company that he assigned to “dependable subordinates.” \nRespondent was asked about and, over the objections of his counsel, admitted receiving, the April 1970 \nletter addressed to him from the FDA regarding insanitary conditions at Acme’s Philadelphia warehouse. \nHe acknowledged that, with the exception of the division vice president, the same individuals had \nresponsibility for sanitation in both Baltimore and Philadelphia. Finally, in response to questions \nconcerning the Philadelphia and Baltimore incidents, respondent admitted that the Baltimore problem \nindicated the system for handling sanitation “wasn’t working perfectly” and that as Acme’s chief executive \nofficer he was “responsible for any result which occurs in our company.” \n \nAt the close of the evidence, respondent’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal was denied. The \nrelevant portion of the trial judge’s instructions to the jury challenged by respondent is set out in the \nmargin. Respondent’s counsel objected to the instructions on the ground that they failed fairly to reflect \nour decision in United States v. Dotterweich supra, and to define “‘responsible relationship.’” The trial \njudge overruled the objection. The jury found respondent guilty on all counts of the information, and he \nwas subsequently sentenced to pay a fine of $50 on each count. The Court of Appeals reversed the \nconviction and remanded for a new trial. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n274 \n \n* * * \n \nThe question presented by the Government’s petition for certiorari in United States v. Dotterweich, and \nthe focus of this Court’s opinion, was whether the manager of a corporation, as well as the corporation \nitself, may be prosecuted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 for the introduction of \nmisbranded and adulterated articles into interstate commerce. In Dotterweich, a jury had disagreed as to \nthe corporation, a jobber purchasing drugs from manufacturers and shipping them in interstate \ncommerce under its own label, but had convicted Dotterweich, the corporation’s president and general \nmanager. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that only the drug dealer, whether \ncorporation or individual, was subject to the criminal provisions of the Act, and that where the dealer was \na corporation, an individual connected therewith might be held personally only if he was operating the \ncorporation as his ‘alter ego.’ \n \nIn reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstating Dotterweich’s conviction, this Court \nlooked to the purposes of the Act and noted that they “touch phases of the lives and health of people \nwhich, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. It observed that \nthe Act is of “a now familiar type” which “dispenses with the conventional requirement for criminal \nconduct-awareness of some wrongdoing: In the interest of the larger good it puts the burden of acting at \nhazard upon a person otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to a public danger.

Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 258 (1952). Cases under \nthe Federal Food and Drugs Act of 1906 reflected the view both that knowledge or intent were not \nrequired to be proved in prosecutions under its criminal provisions, and that responsible corporate agents \ncould be subjected to the liability thereby imposed. \n* * * \n \nThe rationale of the interpretation given the Act in Dotterweich…has been confirmed in our subsequent \ncases. Thus, the Court has reaffirmed the proposition that the public interest in the purity of its food is so \ngreat as to warrant the imposition of the highest standard of care on distributors. \n \nThus Dotterweich and the cases which have followed reveal that in providing sanctions which reach and \ntouch the individuals who execute the corporate mission—and this is by no means necessarily confined to \na single corporate agent or employee—the Act imposes not only a positive duty to seek out and remedy \nviolations when they occur but also, and primarily, a duty to implement measures that will insure that \nviolations will not occur.

We are satisfied \nthat the Act imposes the highest standard of care and permits conviction of responsible corporate officials \nwho, in light of this standard of care, have the power to prevent or correct violations of its provisions. \n \n* * * \n \nReversed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

Most criminal law requires a specific \nintent to commit the prohibited act (although a very few economic acts, made criminal by modern \nlegislation, dispense with the requirement of intent). In this way, criminal law differs from much of civil \nlaw—for example, from the tort of negligence, in which carelessness, rather than intent, can result in \nliability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n277 \nMajor crimes are known as felonies. Minor crimes are known as misdemeanors. Most people have a \ngeneral notion about familiar crimes, such as murder and theft. But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act.

But conventional knowledge does not \nsuffice for understanding technical distinctions among related crimes, such as larceny, robbery, and false \npretenses. These distinctions can be important because an individual can be found guilty not merely for \ncommitting one of the acts defined in the criminal law but also for attempting or conspiring to commit \nsuch an act. It is usually easier to convict someone of attempt or conspiracy than to convict for the main \ncrime, and a person involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony may find that very little is required to put \nhim into serious trouble. \n \nOf major concern to the business executive is white-collar crime, which encompasses a host of offenses, \nincluding bribery, embezzlement, fraud, restraints of trade, and computer crime. Anyone accused of crime \nshould know that they always have the right to consult with a lawyer and should always do so. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Bill is the chief executive of a small computer manufacturing company that desperately needs funds to \ncontinue operating. One day a stranger comes to Bill to induce him to take part in a cocaine smuggling deal \nthat would net Bill millions of dollars. Unbeknownst to Bill, the stranger is an undercover policeman. Bill \ntells the stranger to go away. The stranger persists, and after five months of arguing and cajoling, the \nstranger wears down Bill’s will to resist. Bill agrees to take delivery of the cocaine and hands over a down \npayment of $10,000 to the undercover agent, who promptly arrests him for conspiracy to violate the \nnarcotics laws. What defenses does Bill have? \n2. You are the manager of a bookstore. A customer becomes irritated at having to stand in line and begins to \nshout at the salesclerk for refusing to wait on him. You come out of your office and ask the customer to \ncalm down. He shouts at you. You tell him to leave. He refuses. So you and the salesclerk pick him up and \nshove him bodily out the door. He calls the police to have you arrested for assault. Should the police arrest \nyou? Assuming that they do, how would you defend yourself in court? \n3. Marilyn is arrested for arson against a nuclear utility, a crime under both state and federal law. She is \nconvicted in state court and sentenced to five years in jail. Then the federal government decides to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n278 \nprosecute her for the same offense. Does she have a double-jeopardy defense against the federal \nprosecution? \n4. Tectonics, a US corporation, is bidding on a project in Nigeria, and its employee wins the bid by secretly \ngiving $100,000 to the Nigerian public official that has the most say about which company will be awarded \nthe contract. The contract is worth $80 million, and Tectonics expects to make at least $50 million on the \nproject. Has a crime under US law been committed? \n5. Suppose that the CEO of Tectonics, Ted Nelson, is not actually involved in bribery of the Nigerian public \nofficial Adetutu Adeleke. Instead, suppose that the CFO, Jamie Skillset, is very accomplished at insulating \nboth top management and the board of directors from some of the “operational realities” within the \ncompany. Skillset knows that Whoopi Goldmine, a Nigerian employee of Tectonics, has made the deal with \nAdeleke and secured the contract for Tectonics. Is it possible that Nelson, as well as Skillset, can be found \nguilty of a crime? \n6. You have graduated from college and, after working hard for ten years, have scraped enough money \ntogether to make a down payment on a forty-acre farm within driving distance to the small city where you \nwork in Colorado. In town at lunch one day, you run into an old friend from high school, Hayley Mills, who \ntells you that she is saving her money to start a high-end consignment shop in town. You allow her to have \na room in your house for a few months until she has enough money to go into business. Over the following \nweeks, however, you realize that old acquaintances from high school are stopping by almost daily for short \nvisits. When you bring this up to Hayley, she admits that many old friends are now relying on her for \nmarijuana. She is not a licensed caregiver in Colorado and is clearly violating the law. Out of loyalty, you tell \nher that she has three weeks to move out, but you do not prevent her from continuing sales while she is \nthere. What crime have you committed? \n7.

Know why most legal systems have tort law. \n2. Identify the three kinds of torts. \n3. Show how tort law relates to criminal law and contract law. \n4. Understand negligent torts and defenses to claims of negligence. \n5. Understand strict liability torts and the reasons for them in the US legal system. \n \n \nIn civil litigation, contract and tort claims are by far the most numerous. The law attempts to adjust \nfor harms done by awarding damages to a successful plaintiff who demonstrates that the defendant \nwas the cause of the plaintiff’s losses. Torts can be intentional torts, negligent torts, or strict liability \ntorts. Employers must be aware that in many circumstances, their employees may create liability in \ntort. This chapter explains the different kind of torts, as well as available defenses to tort claims. \n \n \n \n7.1 Purpose of Tort Laws \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Explain why a sound market system requires tort law. \n2. Define a tort and give two examples. \n3. Explain the moral basis of tort liability. \n4. Understand the purposes of damage awards in tort. \nDefinition of Tort \nThe term tort is the French equivalent of the English word wrong. The word tortis also derived from the \nLatin word tortum, which means twisted or crooked or wrong, in contrast to the word rectum, which \nmeans straight (rectitude uses that Latin root). Thus conduct that is twisted or crooked and not straight is \na tort. The term was introduced into the English law by the Norman jurists. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n282 \n \nLong ago, tort was used in everyday speech; today it is left to the legal system. A judge will instruct a jury \nthat a tort is usually defined as a wrong for which the law will provide a remedy, most often in the form of \nmoney damages. The law does not remedy all “wrongs.” The preceding definition of tort does not reveal \nthe underlying principles that divide wrongs in the legal sphere from those in the moral sphere. Hurting",

            "chunk": "example, the plaintiff was injured by a spring gun while trespassing on the defendant’s property. [2] The \ndefendant had set up No Trespassing signs after ten years of trespassing and housebreaking events, with \nthe loss of some household items. Windows had been broken, and there was “messing up of the property \nin general.” The defendants had boarded up the windows and doors in order to stop the intrusions and \nfinally had set up a shotgun trap in the north bedroom of the house. One defendant had cleaned and oiled \nhis 20-gauge shotgun and taken it to the old house where it was secured to an iron bed with the barrel \npointed at the bedroom door. “It was rigged with wire from the doorknob to the gun’s trigger so would fire \nwhen the door was opened.” The angle of the shotgun was adjusted to hit an intruder in the legs. The \nspring could not be seen from the outside, and no warning of its presence was posted. \n \nThe plaintiff, Katko, had been hunting in the area for several years and considered the property \nabandoned. He knew it had long been uninhabited. He and a friend had been to the house and found \nseveral old bottles and fruit jars that they took and added to their collection of antiques. When they made \na second trip to the property, they entered by removing a board from a porch window. When the plaintiff \nopened the north bedroom door, the shotgun went off and struck him in the right leg above the ankle \nbone. Much of his leg was blown away. While Katko knew he had no right to break and enter the house \nwith intent to steal bottles and fruit jars, the court held that a property owner could not protect an \nunoccupied boarded-up farmhouse by using a spring gun capable of inflicting death or serious injury. \n \nIn Katko, there is an intentional tort. But what if someone trespassing is injured by the negligence of the \nlandowner? States have differing rules about trespass and negligence. In some states, a trespasser is only \nprotected against the gross negligence of the landowner. In other states, trespassers may be owed the duty \nof due care on the part of the landowner. The burglar who falls into a drained swimming pool, for \nexample, may have a case against the homeowner unless the courts or legislature of that state have made \nit clear that trespassers are owed the limited duty to avoid gross negligence. Or a very small child may \nwander off his own property and fall into a gravel pit on a nearby property and suffer death or serious \ninjury; if the pit should (in the exercise of due care) have been filled in or some barrier erected around it, \nthen there was negligence. But if the state law holds that the duty to trespassers is only to avoid gross \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n291 \nnegligence, the child’s family would lose, unless the state law makes an exception for very young \ntrespassers. In general, guests, licensees, and invitees are owed a duty of due care; a trespasser may not be \nowed such a duty, but states have different rules on this. \n \nIntentional Interference with Contractual Relations \nTortious interference with a contract can be established by proving four elements: \n \n1. There was a contract between the plaintiff and a third party. \n2. The defendant knew of the contract. \n3. The defendant improperly induced the third party to breach the contract or made performance of the \ncontract impossible. \n4. There was injury to the plaintiff. \n \nIn a famous case of contract interference, Texaco was sued by Pennzoil for interfering with an agreement \nthat Pennzoil had with Getty Oil. After complicated negotiations between Pennzoil and Getty, a takeover \nshare price was struck, a memorandum of understanding was signed, and a press release announced the \nagreement in principle between Pennzoil and Getty. Texaco’s lawyers, however, believed that Getty oil was \n“still in play,” and before the lawyers for Pennzoil and Getty could complete the paperwork for their \nagreement, Texaco announced it was offering Getty shareholders an additional $12.50 per share over \nwhat Pennzoil had offered. \n \nTexaco later increased its offer to $228 per share, and the Getty board of directors soon began dealing \nwith Texaco instead of Pennzoil. Pennzoil decided to sue in Texas state court for tortious interference with \na contract. After a long trial, the jury returned an enormous verdict against Texaco: $7.53 billion in actual \ndamages and $3 billion in punitive damages. The verdict was so large that it would have bankrupted \nTexaco. Appeals from the verdict centered on an obscure rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), Rule 10(b)-13, and Texaco’s argument was based on that rule and the fact that the contract had not \nbeen completed. If there was no contract, Texaco could not have legally interfered with one. After the SEC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n292 \nfiled a brief that supported Texaco’s interpretation of the law, Texaco agreed to pay $3 billion to Pennzoil \nto dismiss its claim of tortious interference with a contract. \n \nMalicious Prosecution",

The plaintiff must show that \nthe defendant acted with malice or with some purpose other than bringing the guilty to justice. A mere \ncomplaint to the authorities is insufficient to establish the tort, but any official proceeding will support the \nclaim—for example, a warrant for the plaintiff’s arrest. The criminal proceeding must terminate in the \nplaintiff’s favor in order for his suit to be sustained. \n \nA majority of US courts, though by no means all, permit a suit for wrongful civil proceedings. Civil \nlitigation is usually costly and burdensome, and one who forces another to defend himself against baseless \naccusations should not be permitted to saddle the one he sues with the costs of defense. However, \nbecause, as a matter of public policy, litigation is favored as the means by which legal rights can be \nvindicated—indeed, the Supreme Court has even ruled that individuals have a constitutional right to \nlitigate—the plaintiff must meet a heavy burden in proving his case. The mere dismissal of the original \nlawsuit against the plaintiff is not sufficient proof that the suit was unwarranted. The plaintiff in a suit for \nwrongful civil proceedings must show that the defendant (who was the plaintiff in the original suit) filed \nthe action for an improper purpose and had no reasonable belief that his cause was legally or factually \nwell grounded. \n \nDefamation \nDefamation is injury to a person’s good name or reputation. In general, if the harm is done through the \nspoken word—one person to another, by telephone, by radio, or on television—it is called slander. If the \ndefamatory statement is published in written form, it is called libel. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n293 \nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts defines a defamatory communication as one that “so tends to harm the \nreputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from \nassociating or dealing with him.” [3] \n \nA statement is not defamatory unless it is false. Truth is an absolute defense to a charge of libel or slander. \nMoreover, the statement must be “published”—that is, communicated to a third person. You cannot be \nlibeled by one who sends you a letter full of false accusations and scurrilous statements about you unless a \nthird person opens it first (your roommate, perhaps). Any living person is capable of being defamed, but \nthe dead are not. Corporations, partnerships, and other forms of associations can also be defamed, if the \nstatements tend to injure their ability to do business or to garner contributions. \n \nThe statement must have reference to a particular person, but he or she need not be identified by name. A \nstatement that “the company president is a crook” is defamatory, as is a statement that “the major \nnetwork weathermen are imposters.” The company president and the network weathermen could show \nthat the words were aimed at them. But statements about large groups will not support an action for \ndefamation (e.g., “all doctors are butchers” is not defamatory of any particular doctor). \nThe law of defamation is largely built on strict liability. That a person did not intend to defame is \nordinarily no excuse; a typographical error that converts a true statement into a false one in a newspaper, \nmagazine, or corporate brochure can be sufficient to make out a case of libel. Even the exercise of due care \nis usually no excuse if the statement is in fact communicated. Repeating a libel is itself a libel; a libel \ncannot be justified by showing that you were quoting someone else. Though a plaintiff may be able to \nprove that a statement was defamatory, he is not necessarily entitled to an award of damages. That is \nbecause the law contains a number of privileges that excuse the defamation. \n \nPublishing false information about another business’s product constitutes the tort of slander of quality, or \ntrade libel. In some states, this is known as the tort of product disparagement. It may be difficult to \nestablish damages, however. A plaintiff must prove that actual damages proximately resulted from the \nslander of quality and must show the extent of the economic harm as well. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books",

The law also permits the aggrieved person to sue and to recover damages for \nunauthorized profits and also to have the court enjoin (judicially block) any further unauthorized use of \nthe plaintiff’s name, likeness, or image. This is particularly useful to celebrities. \n \nBecause the publishing and advertising industries are concentrated heavily in New York, the statute plays \nan important part in advertising decisions made throughout the country. Deciding what “commercial” or \n“trade” purposes are is not always easy. Thus a newsmagazine may use a baseball player’s picture on its \ncover without first obtaining written permission, but a chocolate manufacturer could not put the player’s \npicture on a candy wrapper without consent. \n \nPersonal Space \nOne form of intrusion upon a person’s solitude—trespass—has long been actionable under common law. \nPhysical invasion of home or other property is not a new tort. But in recent years, the notion of intrusion \nhas been broadened considerably. Now, taking photos of someone else with your cell phone in a locker \nroom could constitute invasion of the right to privacy. Reading someone else’s mail or e-mail could also \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n296 \nconstitute an invasion of the right to privacy. Photographing someone on a city street is not tortious, but \nsubsequent use of the photograph could be. Whether the invasion is in a public or private space, the \namount of damages will depend on how the image or information is disclosed to others. \n \nPublic Disclosure of Embarassing Facts \nCirculation of false statements that do injury to a person are actionable under the laws of defamation. \nWhat about true statements that might be every bit as damaging—for example, disclosure of someone’s \nincome tax return, revealing how much he earned? The general rule is that if the facts are truly private \nand of no “legitimate” concern to the public, then their disclosure is a violation of the right to privacy. But \na person who is in the public eye cannot claim the same protection. \n \nFalse Light \nA final type of privacy invasion is that which paints a false picture in a publication. Though false, it might \nnot be libelous, since the publication need contain nothing injurious to reputation. Indeed, the publication \nmight even glorify the plaintiff, making him seem more heroic than he actually is. Subject to the First \nAmendment requirement that the plaintiff must show intent or extreme recklessness, statements that put \na person in a false light, like a fictionalized biography, are actionable. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are many kinds of intentional torts. Some of them involve harm to the physical person or to his or her \nproperty, reputation or feelings, or economic interests. In each case of intentional tort, the plaintiff must \nshow that the defendant intended harm, but the intent to harm does not need to be directed at a particular \nperson and need not be malicious, as long as the resulting harm is a direct consequence of the defendant’s \nactions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

It is common, for example, for \nthe owner of an automobile to be liable for the negligence of one to whom the owner lends the car. So-\ncalled dram shop statutes place liability on bar and tavern owners and others who serve too much alcohol \nto one who, in an intoxicated state, later causes injury to others. In these situations, although the injurious \nact of the drinker stemmed from negligence, the one whom the law holds vicariously liable (the bartender) \nis not himself necessarily negligent—the law is holding him strictly liable, and to this concept we now \nturn. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe most common tort claim is based on the negligence of the defendant. In each negligence claim, the \nplaintiff must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the defendant had a duty of due care, (2) \nthe defendant breached that duty, (3) that the breach of duty both actually and approximately has caused \nharm to the plaintiff, and (4) that the harm is measurable in money damages. \nIt is also possible for the negligence of one person to be imputed to another, as in the case of respondeat \nsuperior, or in the case of someone who loans his automobile to another driver who is negligent and causes \ninjury. There are many excuses (defenses) to claims of negligence, including assumption of risk and \ncomparative negligence. In those few jurisdictions where contributory negligence has not been modified to \ncomparative negligence, plaintiffs whose negligence contributes to their own injuries will be barred from any \nrecovery. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understand the historical origins of strict liability under common law. \n3. Be able to apply strict liability concepts to liability for defective products. \n4. Distinguish strict liability from absolute liability, and understand the major defenses to a lawsuit in \nproducts-liability cases. \n \n \n \nHistorical Basis of Strict Liability: Animals and Ultrahazardous Activities \nTo this point, we have considered principles of liability that in some sense depend upon the “fault” of the \ntortfeasor. This fault is not synonymous with moral blame. \n \nAside from acts intended to harm, the fault lies in a failure to live up to a standard of reasonableness or \ndue care. But this is not the only basis for tort liability. Innocent mistakes can be a sufficient basis. As we \nhave already seen, someone who unknowingly trespasses on another’s property is liable for the damage \nthat he does, even if he has a reasonable belief that the land is his. And it has long been held that someone \nwho engages in ultrahazardous (or sometimes, abnormally dangerous) activities is liable for damage that \nhe causes, even though he has taken every possible precaution to avoid harm to someone else. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n307 \n \nLikewise, the owner of animals that escape from their pastures or homes and damage neighboring \nproperty may be liable, even if the reason for their escape was beyond the power of the owner to stop (e.g., \na fire started by lightning that burns open a barn door). In such cases, the courts invoke the principle of \nstrict liability, or, as it is sometimes called, liability without fault. The reason for the rule is explained \nin Klein v. Pyrodyne Corporation (Section 7.5 \"Cases\"). \n \nStrict Liability for Products \nProducts liability is extremely important. Strict liability may also apply as a legal standard for products, \neven those that are not ultrahazardous. In some national legal systems, strict liability is not available as a \ncause of action to plaintiffs seeking to recover a judgment of products liability against a manufacturer, \nwholesaler, distributor, or retailer. (Some states limit liability to the manufacturer.) But it is available in \nthe United States and initially was created by a California Supreme Court decision in the 1962 case \nof Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc. \n \nIn Greenman, the plaintiff had used a home power saw and bench, the Shopsmith, designed and \nmanufactured by the defendant. He was experienced in using power tools and was injured while using the \napproved lathe attachment to the Shopsmith to fashion a wooden chalice. The case was decided on the",

University of Denver \n744 P.2d 54 (Supreme Court of Colorado1987) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n313 \nOn June 19, 1978, at approximately 10:00 p.m., plaintiff Oscar Whitlock suffered a paralyzing injury while \nattempting to complete a one-and-three-quarters front flip on a trampoline. The injury rendered him a \nquadriplegic. The trampoline was owned by the Beta Theta Pi fraternity (the Beta house) and was situated \non the front yard of the fraternity premises, located on the University campus. At the time of his injury, \nWhitlock was twenty years old, attended the University of Denver, and was a member of the Beta house, \nwhere he held the office of acting house manager. The property on which the Beta house was located was \nleased to the local chapter house association of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity by the defendant University of \nDenver. \n \nWhitlock had extensive experience jumping on trampolines. He began using trampolines in junior high \nschool and continued to do so during his brief tenure as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at \nWest Point, where he learned to execute the one-and-three-quarters front flip. Whitlock testified that he \nutilized the trampoline at West Point every other day for a period of two months. He began jumping on \nthe trampoline owned by the Beta house in September of 1977. Whitlock recounted that in the fall and \nspring prior to the date of his injury, he jumped on the trampoline almost daily. He testified further that \nprior to the date of his injury, he had successfully executed the one-and-three-quarters front flip between \nseventy-five and one hundred times. \n \nDuring the evening of June 18 and early morning of June 19, 1978, Whitlock attended a party at the Beta \nhouse, where he drank beer, vodka and scotch until 2:00 a.m. Whitlock then retired and did not awaken \nuntil 2:00 p.m. on June 19. He testified that he jumped on the trampoline between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 \np.m., and again at 7:00 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the time of the injury, there again was a party in progress at \nthe Beta house, and Whitlock was using the trampoline with only the illumination from the windows of \nthe fraternity house, the outside light above the front door of the house, and two street lights in the area. \nAs Whitlock attempted to perform the one-and-three-quarters front flip, he landed on the back of his \nhead, causing his neck to break. \n \nWhitlock brought suit against the manufacturer and seller of the trampoline, the University, the Beta \nTheta Pi fraternity and its local chapter, and certain individuals in their capacities as representatives of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n314 \nthe Beta Theta Pi organizations. Whitlock reached settlements with all of the named defendants except \nthe University, so only the negligence action against the University proceeded to trial. The jury returned a \nverdict in favor of Whitlock, assessing his total damages at $ 7,300,000. The jury attributed twenty-eight \npercent of causal negligence to the conduct of Whitlock and seventy-two percent of causal negligence to \nthe conduct of the University. The trial court accordingly reduced the amount of the award against the \nUniversity to $ 5,256,000.",

[Citations] \n“The court determines, as a matter of law, the existence and scope of the duty—that is, whether the \nplaintiff’s interest that has been infringed by the conduct of the defendant is entitled to legal protection.” \n[Citations] In Smith v. City & County of Denver, 726 P.2d 1125 (Colo. 1986), we set forth several factors to \nbe considered in determining the existence of duty in a particular case: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n315 \nWhether the law should impose a duty requires consideration of many factors including, for \nexample, the risk involved, the foreseeability and likelihood of injury as weighed against the \nsocial utility of the actor’s conduct, the magnitude of the burden of guarding against injury or \nharm, and the consequences of placing the burden upon the actor. \n \n…A court’s conclusion that a duty does or does not exist is “an expression of the sum total of those \nconsiderations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is [or is not] entitled to protection.” \n… \nWe believe that the fact that the University is charged with negligent failure to act rather than negligent \naffirmative action is a critical factor that strongly militates against imposition of a duty on the University \nunder the facts of this case. In determining whether a defendant owes a duty to a particular plaintiff, the \nlaw has long recognized a distinction between action and a failure to act—“that is to say, between active \nmisconduct working positive injury to others [misfeasance] and passive inaction or a failure to take steps \nto protect them from harm [nonfeasance].” W. Keeton, § 56, at 373. Liability for nonfeasance was slow to \nreceive recognition in the law. “The reason for the distinction may be said to lie in the fact that by \n‘misfeasance’ the defendant has created a new risk of harm to the plaintiff, while by ‘nonfeasance’ he has \nat least made his situation no worse, and has merely failed to benefit him by interfering in his \naffairs.” Id. The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 314 (1965) summarizes the law on this point as follows: \n \nThe fact that an actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s \naid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action. \n \nImposition of a duty in all such cases would simply not meet the test of fairness under contemporary \nstandards. \n \nIn nonfeasance cases the existence of a duty has been recognized only during the last century in situations \ninvolving a limited group of special relationships between parties. Such special relationships are \npredicated on “some definite relation between the parties, of such a character that social policy justifies \nthe imposition of a duty to act.” W.

Klein sued Pyrodyne for strict \nliability to recover for his injuries. Pyrodyne asserted that the Chinese manufacturer of the fireworks was \nnegligent in producing the rocket and therefore Pyrodyne should not be held liable. The trial court applied \nthe doctrine of strict liability and held in favor of Klein. Pyrodyne appealed. \n \nSection 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that any party carrying on an “abnormally \ndangerous activity” is strictly liable for ensuing damages. The public display of fireworks fits this \ndefinition. The court stated: “Any time a person ignites rockets with the intention of sending them aloft to \nexplode in the presence of large crowds of people, a high risk of serious personal injury or property \ndamage is created. That risk arises because of the possibility that a rocket will malfunction or be \nmisdirected.” Pyrodyne argued that its liability was cut off by the Chinese manufacturer’s negligence. The \ncourt rejected this argument, stating, “Even if negligence may properly be regarded as an intervening \ncause, it cannot function to relieve Pyrodyne from strict liability.” \n \nThe Washington Supreme Court held that the public display of fireworks is an abnormally dangerous \nactivity that warrants the imposition of strict liability. \n \nAffirmed. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why would certain activities be deemed ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous so that strict liability is \nimposed? \n2. If the activities are known to be abnormally dangerous, did Klein assume the risk? \n3. Assume that the fireworks were negligently manufactured in China. Should Klein’s only remedy be against \nthe Chinese company, as Pyrodyne argues? Why or why not? \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n324 \n \n \n \n7.6 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary",

Although both involve the concept of duty, creation of the duty differs in a manner \nthat is important to business. The parties create contract duties through a bargaining process. The \nkey element in the process is control; individuals are in control of a situation because they have the \nfreedom to decide whether to enter into a contractual relationship. Tort duties, in contrast, are \nobligations the law imposes. Despite the obvious difficulty in controlling tort liability, an \nunderstanding of tort theory is important because it is a critical factor in strategic planning and risk \nmanagement. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8.1 General Perspectives on Contracts \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1.

In “primitive” societies and in the medieval Europe from which our \ninstitutions sprang, the relationships among people were largely fixed; traditions spelled out duties that \neach person owed to family, tribe, or manor. Though he may have oversimplified, Sir Henry Maine, a \nnineteenth-century historian, sketched the development of society in his classic book Ancient Law. As he \nput it: \n \n(F)rom a condition of society in which all the relations of Persons are summed up in the relations \nof Family, we seem to have steadily moved towards a phase of social order in which all these \nrelations arise from the free agreement of Individuals. . . . Thus the status of the Slave has \ndisappeared—it has been superseded by the contractual relation of the servant to his master. . . . \nThe status of the Female under Tutelage . . . has also ceased to exist. . . . So too the status of the \nSon under Power has no true place in the law of modern European societies. If any civil \nobligation binds together the Parent and the child of full age, it is one to which only contract gives \nits legal validity.... If then we employ Status, agreeably with the usage of the best writers, to \nsignify these personal conditions [arising from ancient legal privileges of the Family] only, we \nmay say that the movement of the progressive societies has hitherto been a movement from \nStatus to Contract. [1] \n \nThis movement was not accidental. It went hand-in-glove with the emerging industrial order; from the \nfifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, as England, especially, evolved into a booming mercantile economy \nwith all that that implies—flourishing trade, growing cities, an expanding monetary system, \ncommercialization of agriculture, mushrooming manufacturing—contract law was created of necessity. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n330 \nContract law did not develop, however, according to a conscious, far-seeing plan. It was a response to \nchanging conditions, and the judges who created it frequently resisted, preferring the quieter, imagined \npastoral life of their forefathers. Not until the nineteenth century, in both the United States and England, \ndid a full-fledged law of contracts arise together with modem capitalism. \n \nContract Defined \nAs usual in the law, the legal definition of “contract” is formalistic. The Restatement says: “A contract is \na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which \nthe law in some way recognizes as a duty.” (Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 1) Similarly, the \nUniform Commercial Code says: “‘Contract’ means the total legal obligation which results from the \nparties’ agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law.” (Section 1-201(11)) A \nshort-hand definition is: “A contract is a legally enforceable promise.” \n \nEconomic View of Contract Law \nIn An Economic Analysis of Law (1973), Judge Richard A. Posner (a former University of Chicago law \nprofessor) suggests that contract law performs three significant economic functions. First, it helps \nmaintain incentives to individuals to exchange goods and services efficiently. Second, it reduces the costs \nof economic transactions because its very existence means that the parties need not go to the trouble of \nnegotiating a variety of rules and terms already spelled out. Third, the law of contracts alerts the parties to \ntrouble spots that have arisen in the past, thus making it easier to plan the transactions more intelligently \nand avoid potential pitfalls. \n \nSources of Contract Law \nThere are four basic sources of contract law: the Constitution, federal and state statutes, federal and state \ncase law, and administrative law. For our purposes, the most important of these, and the ones that we will \nexamine at some length, are case law and statutes. \n \nCase (Common) Law and the Restatement of Contracts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n331 \nBecause contract law was forged in the common-law courtroom, hammered out case by case on the anvil \nof individual judges, it grew in the course of time to formidable proportions. By the early twentieth \ncentury, tens of thousands of contract disputes had been submitted to the courts for resolution, and the \npublished opinions, if collected in one place, would have filled dozens of bookshelves. Clearly this mass of \ncase law was too unwieldy for efficient use. A similar problem had developed in the other leading",

In 1958, the Conference and the \nInstitute amended the Code further and again reissued it, this time as the 1958 Official Text. Sixteen \nstates, including Pennsylvania, adopted this version. \n \nBut in so doing, many of these states changed particular provisions. As a consequence, the Uniform \nCommercial Code was no longer so uniform. Responding to this development the American Law Institute \nestablished a permanent editorial board to oversee future revisions of the code. Various subcommittees \nwent to work redrafting, and a 1962 Official Text was eventually published. Twelve more states adopted \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n333 \nthe code, eleven of them the 1962 text. By 1966, only three states and two territories had failed to enact \nany version: Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Guam, and Puerto Rico. \n \nMeanwhile, non-uniform provisions continued to be enacted in various states, particularly in Article 9, to \nwhich 337 such amendments had been made. In 1971, a redraft of that article was readied and the 1972 \nOfficial Text was published. By that time, Louisiana was the only holdout. Two years later, in 1974, \nLouisiana made the UCC a truly national law when it enacted some but not all of the 1972 text \n(significantly, Louisiana has not adopted Article 2). One more major change was made, a revision of \nArticle 8, necessitated by the electronics revolution that led to new ways of transferring investment \nsecurities from seller to purchaser. This change was incorporated in the 1978 Official Text, the version \nthat remains current. \n \nFrom this brief history, it is clear that the UCC is now a basic law of relevance to every business and \nbusiness lawyer in the United States, even though it is not entirely uniform because different states have \nadopted it at various stages of its evolution—an evolution that continues still. \n \nThe Basic Framework of the UCC \nThe UCC embraces the Jaw of “commercial transactions,” a term of some ambiguity. A commercial \ntransaction may seem to be a series of separate transactions; it may include, for example, the making of a \ncontract for the sale of goods, the signing of a check, the endorsement of the check, the shipment of goods \nunder a bill of Lading, and so on. However, the UCC presupposes that each of these transactions is a facet \nof one single transaction: the sale of and payment for goods. The Code deals with phases of this \ntransaction from start to finish. These phases are organized according to the following “articles”: \n \n• \nSales (Article 2) \n• \nCommercial Paper (Article 3) \n• \nBank Deposits and Collections (Article 4) \n• \nLetters of Credit (Article 5) \n• \nBulk Transfers (Article 6) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n334 \n• \nWarehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading, and Other Documents of Title (Article 7) \n• \nInvestment Securities (Article 8) \n• \nSecured Transactions; Sales of Accounts and Chattel Paper (Article 9) \n \nWe now turn our attention to the sale—the first facet, and the cornerstone, of the commercial transaction. \nSales law is a special type of contract law in that Article 2 applies only to the sale of goods, defined \n(Section 2-105) in part as “all things . . . which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for \nsale other than the money in which the price is to be paid. . . .” The only contracts and agreements covered \nby Article 2 are those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \n \nIn certain cases, the courts have difficulty in determining the nature of the object of a sales contract. The \nproblem: How can goods and services be separated in contracts calling for the seller to deliver a \ncombination of goods and services? This difficulty frequently arises in product liability cases in which the \nbuyer sues the seller for breach of one of the UCC warranties. For example, you go to the hairdresser for a \npermanent and the shampoo gives you a severe scalp rash. May you recover damages on the grounds that \neither the hairdresser or the manufacturer breached an implied warranty in the sale of goods? \n \nWhen the goods used are incidental to the service, the courts are split on whether the plaintiff should win. \nCompare Epstein v. Giannattasio, 197 A.2d 342 (Conn. 1963), in which the court held that no sale of \ngoods had been made because the plaintiff received a treatment in which the cosmetics were only \nincidentally used, with Newmark v. Gimbel’s Inc., 258 A.2d 697 (N.J. 1969), in which the court said “[i]f \nthe permanent wave lotion were sold … for home consumption . . . unquestionably an implied warranty of \nfitness for that purpose would have been an integral incident of the sale.” The New Jersey court rejected \nthe defendant’s argument that by actually applying the lotion to the patron’s head the salon lessened the \nliability it otherwise would have had if it had simply sold her the lotion. \n \nIn two areas, state legislatures have taken the goods vs. services issue out of the courts’ hands and",

Some are written, some oral; some are explicit, some not. \nBecause contracts can be formed, expressed, and enforced in a variety of ways, a taxonomy of contracts \nhas developed that is useful in lumping together like legal consequences. In general, contracts are \nclassified along these dimensions: explicitness, mutuality, enforceability, and degree of \ncompletion. Explicitness is concerned with the degree to which the agreement is manifest to those not \nparty to it. Mutuality takes into account whether promises are exchanged by two parties or only \none. Enforceability is the degree to which a given contract is binding. Completion considers whether \nthe contract is yet to be performed or the obligations have been fully discharged by one or both parties. \nWe will examine each of these concepts in turn. \n \nExplicitness \nExpress Contract \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n337 \nAn express contract is one in which the terms are spelled out directly; the parties to an express \ncontract, whether written or oral, are conscious that they are making an enforceable agreement. For \nexample, an agreement to purchase your neighbor’s car for $500 and to take title next Monday is an \nexpress contract. \n \nImplied Contract \nAn implied contract is one that is inferred from the actions of the parties. Although no discussion of \nterms took place, an implied contract exists if it is clear from the conduct of both parties that they \nintended there be one. A delicatessen patron who asks for a “turkey sandwich to go” has made a contract \nand is obligated to pay when the sandwich is made. By ordering the food, the patron is implicitly agreeing \nto the price, whether posted or not. \n \nContract Implied in Law: Quasi-contract \nBoth express and implied contracts embody an actual agreement of the parties. A quasi-contract, by \ncontrast, is an obligation said to be ‘‘imposed by law” in order to avoid unjust enrichment of one person at \nthe expense of another. In fact, a quasi-contract is not a contract at all; it is a fiction that the courts \ncreated to prevent injustice. Suppose, for example, that a carpenter mistakenly believes you have hired \nhim to repair your porch; in fact, it is your neighbor who has hired him. One Saturday morning he arrives \nat your doorstep and begins to work. Rather than stop him, you let him proceed, pleased at the prospect of \nhaving your porch fixed for free (since you have never talked to the carpenter, you figure you need not pay \nhis bill). Although it is true there is no contract, the law implies a contract for the value of the work. \n \n \nMutuality \nThe garden-variety contract is one in which the parties make mutual promises. Each is both promisor and \npromisee; that is, each pledges to do something and each is the recipient of such a pledge. This type of \ncontract is called a bilateral contract. But mutual promises are not necessary to constitute a \ncontract. Unilateral contracts, in which only one party makes a promise, are equally valid but depend \nupon performance of the promise to be binding. If Charles says to Fran, “I will pay you five dollars if you \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n338 \nwash my car,” Charles is contractually bound to pay once Fran washes the car. Fran never makes a \npromise, but by actually performing she makes Charles liable to pay. A common example of a unilateral \ncontract is the offer “$50 for the return of my lost dog.” Frances never makes a promise to the offeror, but \nif she looks for the dog and finds it, she is entitled to the $50. \n \nEnforceability \nNot every agreement between two people is a binding contract. An agreement that is lacking one of the \nlegal elements of a contract is said to be void—that is, not a contract at all. An agreement that is illegal—\nfor example, a promise to commit a crime in return for a money payment—is void. Neither party to a void \n“contract” may enforce it. \n \nBy contrast, a voidable contract is one that is unenforceable by one party but enforceable by the other. \nFor example, a minor (any person under eighteen, in most states) may “avoid” a contract with an adult; \nthe adult may not enforce the contract against the minor, if the minor refuses to carry out the bargain. But \nthe adult has no choice if the minor wishes the contract to be performed. (A contract may be voidable by \nboth parties if both are minors.) Ordinarily, the parties to a voidable contract are entitled to be restored to \ntheir original condition. Suppose you agree to buy your seventeen-year-old neighbor’s car. He delivers it \nto you in exchange for your agreement to pay him next week. He has the legal right to terminate the deal \nand recover the car, in which case you will of course have no obligation to pay him. If you have already \npaid him, he still may legally demand a return to the status quo ante (previous state of affairs). You must \nreturn the car to him; he must return the cash to you.",

Since people in business frequently conduct contract negotiations \nwithout the assistance of a lawyer, it is important to attend to the nuances to avoid legal trouble at the \noutset. Whether a valid enforceable contract has been formed depends in turn on whether: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n341 \n \n1. The parties reached an agreement (offer and acceptance); \n2. Consideration was present (some “price was paid for what was received in return); \n3. The agreement was legal; \n4. The parties entered into the contract with capacity to make a contract; and \n5. The agreement is in the proper form (something in writing, if required). \n \nThe Agreement: Offer and Acceptance \nThe core of a legal contract is the agreement between the parties. That is not merely a matter of \nconvenience; it is at the heart of our received philosophical and psychological beliefs. As the great student \nof contract law, Samuel Williston, put it: \n \nIt was a consequence of the emphasis laid on the ego and the individual will that the formation of \na contract should seem impossible unless the wills of the parties concurred. Accordingly we find \nat the end of the eighteenth century, and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the prevalent \nidea that there must be a “meeting of the minds” (a new phrase) in order to form a contract. \n(1921, p. 365) \n \nAlthough agreements may take any form, including unspoken conduct between the parties (UCC Section \n2-204(1)), they are usually structured in terms of an offer and an acceptance. Note, however, that not \nevery agreement, in the broadest sense of the word, need consist of an offer and acceptance, and it is \nentirely possible, therefore, for two persons to reach agreement without forming a contract. For example, \npeople may agree that the weather is pleasant or that it would be preferable to go out for Chinese food \nrather than seeing a foreign film; in neither case has a contract been formed. One of the major functions \nof the law of contracts is to sort out those agreements that are legally binding—those that are contracts—\nfrom those that are not. \n \nIn interpreting agreements, courts generally apply an objective standard. The Restatement (Second) of \nContracts defines agreement as a “manifestation of mutual assent by two or more persons to one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n342 \nanother.” (Section 3) The UCC defines agreement as “the bargain of the parties in fact as found in their \nlanguage or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or \ncourse of performance.” (Section 1-201(3)) The critical question is what the parties said or did, not what \nthey thought they said or did. \n \nThe distinction between objective and subjective standards crops up occasionally when one person claims \nhe spoke in jest. The vice president of a manufacturer of punchboards, used in gambling, testified to the \nWashington State Game Commission that he would pay $100,000 to anyone who found a “crooked \nboard.” Barnes, a bartender, who had purchased two that were crooked some time before, brought one to \nthe company office, and demanded payment. The company refused, claiming that the statement was made \nin jest (the audience before the commission had laughed when the offer was made). The court disagreed, \nholding that it was reasonable to interpret the pledge of $100,000 as a means of promoting punchboards: \n \n(I)f the jest is not apparent and a reasonable hearer would believe that an offer was being made, \nthen the speaker risks the formation of a contract which was not intended. It is the objective \nmanifestations of the offeror that count and not secret, unexpressed intentions. If a party’s words \nor acts, judged by a reasonable standard, manifest an intention to agree in regard to the matter \nin question, that agreement is established, and it is immaterial what may be the real but \nunexpressed state of the party’s mind on the subject. [1] \n \nAn offer is a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain such that it would be reasonable for \nanother individual to conclude that assent to the offer would complete the bargain. Offers must be \ncommunicated and must be definite; that is, they must spell out terms to which the offeree can assent. \n \nTo constitute an agreement, there must be an acceptance of the offer. The offeree must manifest his \nassent to the terms of the offer in a manner invited or required by the offer. Complications arise when an \noffer is accepted indirectly through correspondence. Although offers and revocations of offers are not \neffective until received, an acceptance is deemed accepted when sent if the offeree accepts in the manner \nspecified by the offeror. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n343 \n \nIf the offeror specifies no particular mode, then acceptance is effective when transmitted as long as the",

(In \nsome states, a court may ratify the contract before the child becomes an adult. In California, for example, \na state statute permits a movie producer to seek court approval of a contract with a child actor in order to \nprevent the child from disaffirming it upon reaching majority and suing for additional wages. As quid pro \nquo, the court can order the producer to pay a percentage of the wages into a trust fund that the child’s \nparents or guardians cannot invade.) If the child has not disaffirmed the contract while still a minor, she \nmay do so within a reasonable time after reaching majority. \n \nIn most cases of disavowal, the only obligation is to return the goods (if he still has them) or repay the \nconsideration (unless it has been dissipated). However, in two situations, a minor might incur greater \nliability: contracts for necessities and misrepresentation of age. \n \nContract for Necessities \nAt common law, a “necessity” was defined as an essential need of a human being: food, medicine, \nclothing, and shelter. In recent years, however, the courts have expanded the concept, so that in many \nstates today necessities include property and services that will enable the minor to earn a living and to \nprovide for those dependent on him. If the contract is executory, the minor can simply disaffirm. If the \ncontract has been executed, however, the minor must face more onerous consequences. Although he will \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n347 \nnot be required to perform under the contract, he will be liable under a theory of “quasi-contract” for the \nreasonable value of the necessity. \n \nMisrepresentation of Age \nIn most states, a minor may misrepresent his age and disaffirm in accordance with the general rule, \nbecause that’s what kids do, misrepresent their age. That the adult reasonably believed the minor was also \nan adult is of no consequence in a contract suit. But some states have enacted statutes that make the \nminor liable in certain situations. A Michigan statute, for instance, prohibits a minor from disaffirming if \nhe has signed a “separate instrument containing only the statement of age, date of signing and the \nsignature:” And some states “estop” him from claiming to be a minor if he falsely represented himself as \nan adult in making the ·contract. “Estoppel” is a refusal by the courts on equitable grounds to listen to an \notherwise valid defense; unless the minor can return the consideration, the contract will be enforced. \n \nContracts made by an insane or intoxicated person are also said to have been made by a person lacking \ncapacity. In general, such contracts are voidable by the person when capacity is regained (or by the \nperson’s legal representative if capacity is not regained). \n \nForm \nAs a general rule, a contract need not be in writing to be enforceable. An oral agreement to pay a high-\nfashion model $1 million to pose for a photograph is as binding as if the language of the deal were printed \non vellum and signed in the presence of twenty bishops. For centuries, however, a large exception has \ngrown up around the Statute of Frauds, first enacted in England in 1677 under the formal name “An \nAct for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries.” The purpose of the Statute of Frauds is to prevent the \nfraud that occurs when one party attempts to impose upon another a contract that did not in fact exist. \nThe two sections dealing with contracts read as follows: \n[Sect. 4] ...no action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator upon any \nspecial promise, to answer damages out of his own estate; (2) or whereby to charge the \ndefendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriages of another \nperson; (3) or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage; \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n348 \n(4) or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or \nconcerning them; (5) or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one \nyear from the making thereof; (6) unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought, \nor some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged \ntherewith, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. \n \n[Sect. 17] ...no contract for the sale of any goods, wares and merchandizes, for the price of ten \npounds sterling or upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the \ngoods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the bargain, or \nin part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said bargain be made \nand signed by the parties to be charged by such contract, or their agents thereunto lawfully \nauthorized. \n \nAgain, as may be evident from the title of the act and its language, the general purpose of the law is to",

Recognize the interplay between contract and tort as a cause of action. \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n350 \nMonetary awards (called “damages”), specific performance, and restitution are the three principle \nremedies. \n \nIn view of the importance given to the intention of the parties in forming and interpreting contracts, it \nmay seem surprising that the remedy for every breach is not a judicial order that the obligor carry out his \nundertakings. But it is not. Of course, some duties cannot be performed after a breach: time and \ncircumstances will have altered their purpose and rendered many worthless. Still, although there are \nnumerous occasions on which it would be theoretically possible for courts to order the parties to carry out \ntheir contracts, the courts will not do it. In 1897, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., declared in a famous \nline that “the duty to keep a contract at common law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it.” By that he meant simply that the common law looks more toward compensating the \npromisee for his loss than toward compelling the promisor to perform—a person always has the power, \nthough not the right, to breach a contract. Indeed, the law of remedies often provides the parties with an \nincentive to break the contract. In short, the promisor has a choice: to perform or pay. The purpose of \ncontract remedies is, for the most part, to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered—to \nput the non-breaching party in the position he, she, or it would have been in had there been no breach. \n \nCompensatory Damages \nOne party has the right to damages (money ) when the other party has breached the contract unless, of \ncourse, the contract itself or other circumstances suspend or discharge that \nright. Compensatory damages is the general category of damages awarded to make the non-breaching \nparty whole. \n \n \nConsequential Damages \nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to \ncompensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the \nloss as a probable result of the breach.

The leading case, perhaps the most studied case in all the common \nlaw, is Hadley v. Baxendale, decided in England in 1854. Joseph and Jonah Hadley were proprietors of a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n351 \nflour mill in Gloucester. In May 1853, the shaft of the milling engine broke, stopping all milling. An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly \nand reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of \nthings, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been \nin the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of \nthe breach of it. [1] \n \nThis rule, it has been argued, was a subtle change from the earlier rule that permitted damages \nfor any consequences as long as the breach caused the injury and the plaintiff did not exacerbate \nit. But the change was evidently rationalized, at least in part, by the observation that in the “usual \ncourse of things,” a mill would have on hand a spare shaft, so that its operations would not \ncease. [2] \n \nThis sub-set of compensatory damages is called consequential damages—damages that flow as a \nforeseeable consequence of the breach. For example, if you hire a roofer to fix a leak in your roof, and he \ndoes a bad job so that the interior of your house suffers water damage, the roofer is liable not only for the \npoor roofing job, but also for the ruined drapes, damaged flooring and walls, and so on. \n \nNominal Damages \nIf the breach caused no loss, the plaintiff is nevertheless entitled to a minor sum, perhaps one dollar, \ncalled nominal damages. When, for example, a buyer could purchase the same commodity at the same \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n352 \nprice as that contracted for, without spending any extra time or money, there can be no real damages in \nthe event of breach. \n \nIncidental Damages \nSuppose City College hires Prof. Blake on a two-year contract, after an extensive search. After one year the \nprofessor quits to take a job elsewhere, in breach of her contract. If City College has to pay $5000 more to \nfind a replacement for year, Blake is liable for that amount—that’s compensatory damages. But what if it \ncosts City College $1200 to search for, bring to campus and interview a replacement? City College can \nclaim that, too, as incidental damages which include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching \nparty after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if the attempt is unsuccessful. \n \nPunitive Damages \nPunitive damages are those awarded for the purpose of punishing a defendant in a civil action, in \nwhich criminal sanctions may be unavailable. They are not part of the compensation for the loss suffered; \nthey are proper in cases in which the defendant has acted willfully and maliciously and are thought to \ndeter others from acting similarly. Since the purpose of contract law is compensation, not punishment, \npunitive damages have not traditionally been awarded, with one exception: when the breach of contract is \nalso a tort for which punitive damages may be recovered. Punitive damages are permitted in the law of \ntorts (in most states) when the behavior is malicious or willful (reckless conduct causing physical harm, \ndeliberate defamation of one’s character, a knowingly unlawful taking of someone’s property), and some \nkinds of contract breach are also tortuous—for example, when a creditor holding collateral as security \nunder a contract for a loan sells the collateral to a good-faith purchaser for value even though the debtor \nwas not in default, he has breached the contract and committed the tort of conversion. Punitive \ndamages may be awarded, assuming the behavior was willful and not merely mistaken. \n \nPunitive damages are not fixed by law.

Article 2 governs the sale of \ngoods only, defined as things movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale. When the goods \nare “sold” incidental to a service, the courts do not agree on whether Article 2 applies. For two categories \nof goods, legislation specifically answers the question: foodstuffs served by a restaurant are goods; blood \nsupplied for transfusions is not. \n \nTypes of contracts can be distinguished along these axes: (1) express and implied, including quasi-\ncontracts implied by law; (2) bilateral and unilateral; (3) enforceable and unenforceable; and (4) \ncompleted (executed) and uncompleted (executory). To understand contract law, it is necessary to master \nthese distinctions and their nuances. \n \nIn order to determine whether a valid, enforceable contract exists, the following questions must be \nanswered: (1) Did the parties reach an agreement? (2) Was consideration present? (3) Was the agreement \nlegal? (4) Did the parties have capacity to make a contract? (5) Was the agreement in the proper form? \n \nRemedies available against someone who breaches a contract include damages, specific performance, and \nrestitution.

Hohe’s father signed a form entitled “Mission Bay High School PTSA Presents Dr. Karl \nSanto.” Hohe and her father both signed a form titled “Karl Santo Hypnotist,” releasing Santo and the \nschool district from all liability. During the course of the show, while apparently hypnotized, Hohe slid from \nher chair and also fell to the floor about six times and was injured. She, through her father, then sued the \nschool district. The Hohes claimed the release was contrary to public policy; the trial court dismissed the \nsuit on summary judgment. Was the release contrary to public policy? Decide. \n8.

She had provided \nthe necessary household services and emotional support to permit him to successfully pursue his business \ncareer; she had performed housekeeping, cleaning, and shopping services and had run the household and \nraised the children, her own as well as his.

Understand how the agency relationship is created. \n \n \nIntroduction to Agency Law \nWhy Is Agency Law Important, and What Is an Agent? \nAn agent is a person who acts in the name of and on behalf of another, having been given and assumed \nsome degree of authority to do so. Most organized human activity—and virtually all commercial activity—\nis carried on through agency. No corporation would be possible, even in theory, without such a concept. \nWe might say “General Motors is building cars in China,” for example, but we can’t shake hands with \nGeneral Motors. “The General,” as people say, exists and works through agents. Likewise, partnerships \nand other business organizations rely extensively on agents to conduct their business. Indeed, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that agency is the cornerstone of enterprise organization. In a partnership each \npartner is a general agent, while under corporation law the officers and all employees are agents of the \ncorporation. \n \nThe existence of agents does not, however, require a whole new law of torts or contracts. A tort is no less \nharmful when committed by an agent; a contract is no less binding when negotiated by an agent. What \ndoes need to be taken into account, though, is the manner in which an agent acts on behalf of his principal \nand toward a third party. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency Law \nSeveral problematic fact scenarios recur in agency, and law has developed in response. \nJohn Alden \nConsider John Alden (1599–1687), one of the most famous agents in American literature. He is said to \nhave been the first person from the Mayflower to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620; he was a carpenter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n372 \na cooper (barrel maker), and a diplomat. His agency task—of interest here—was celebrated in Henry \nWadsworth Longfellow’s “The Courtship of Miles Standish.” He was to woo Priscilla Mullins (d. 1680), \n“the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,” on behalf of Captain Miles Standish, a valiant soldier who was too shy \nto propose marriage. Standish turned to John Alden, his young and eloquent protégé, and beseeched \nAlden to speak on his behalf, unaware that Alden himself was in love with Priscilla. Alden accepted his \ncaptain’s assignment, despite the knowledge that he would thus lose Priscilla for himself, and sought out \nthe lady. But Alden was so tongue-tied that his vaunted eloquence fell short, turned Priscilla cold toward \nthe object of Alden’s mission, and eventually led her to turn the tables in one of the most famous lines in \nAmerican literature and poetry: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?” John eventually did: the two \nwere married in 1623 in Plymouth. \n \nRecurring Issues in Agency \nLet’s analyze this sequence of events in legal terms—recognizing, of course, that this example is an \nanalogy and that the law, even today, would not impose consequences on Alden for his failure to carry out \nCaptain Standish’s wishes. Alden was the captain’s agent: he was specifically authorized to speak in his \nname in a manner agreed on, toward a specified end, and he accepted the assignment in consideration of \nthe captain’s friendship. He had, however, a conflict of interest. He attempted to carry out the assignment, \nbut he did not perform according to expectations. Eventually, he wound up with the prize himself. Here \nare some questions to consider, the same questions that will recur throughout the discussion of agency: \n \n• \nHow extensive was John’s authority? Could he have made promises to Priscilla on the captain’s \nbehalf—for example, that Standish would have built her a fine house? \n• \nCould he, if he committed a tort, have imposed liability on his principal? Suppose, for example, \nthat he had ridden at breakneck speed to reach Priscilla’s side and while en route ran into and \ninjured a pedestrian on the road. Could the pedestrian have sued Standish? \n• \nSuppose Alden had injured himself on the journey. Would Standish be liable to Alden? \n• \nIs Alden liable to Standish for stealing the heart of Priscilla—that is, for taking the “profits” of the \nenterprise for himself?",

But there are some jobs on which the personal habits \nof the agent may have an effect. The agent is not at liberty to act with impropriety or notoriety, so as to \nbring disrepute on the business in which the principal is engaged. A lecturer at an antialcohol clinic may \nbe directed to refrain from frequenting bars. A bank cashier who becomes known as a gambler may be \nfired. \n \nDuty to Keep and Render Accounts \nThe agent must keep accurate financial records, take receipts, and otherwise act in conformity to standard \nbusiness practices. \n \nDuty to Act Only as Authorized \nThis duty states a truism but is one for which there are limits. A principal’s wishes may have been stated \nambiguously or may be broad enough to confer discretion on the agent. As long as the agent acts \nreasonably under the circumstances, he will not be liable for damages later if the principal ultimately \nrepudiates what the agent has done: “Only conduct which is contrary to the principal’s manifestations to \nhim, interpreted in light of what he has reason to know at the time when he acts,…subjects the agent to \nliability to the principal.”[3] \n \nDuty Not to Attempt the Impossible or Impracticable \nThe principal says to the agent, “Keep working until the job is done.” The agent is not obligated to go \nwithout food or sleep because the principal misapprehended how long it would take to complete the job. \nNor should the agent continue to expend the principal’s funds in a quixotic attempt to gain business, sign \nup customers, or produce inventory when it is reasonably clear that such efforts would be in vain. \n \nDuty to Obey \nAs a general rule, the agent must obey reasonable directions concerning the manner of performance. \nWhat is reasonable depends on the customs of the industry or trade, prior dealings between agent and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n385 \nprincipal, and the nature of the agreement creating the agency. A principal may prescribe uniforms for \nvarious classes of employees, for instance, and a manufacturing company may tell its sales force what \nsales pitch to use on customers. On the other hand, certain tasks entrusted to agents are not subject to the \nprincipal’s control; for example, a lawyer may refuse to permit a client to dictate courtroom tactics. \n \nDuty to Give Information \nBecause the principal cannot be every place at once—that is why agents are hired, after all—much that is \nvital to the principal’s business first comes to the attention of agents. If the agent has actual notice or \nreason to know of information that is relevant to matters entrusted to him, he has a duty to inform the \nprincipal. This duty is especially critical because information in the hands of an agent is, under most \ncircumstances, imputed to the principal, whose legal liabilities to third persons may hinge on receiving \ninformation in timely fashion. Service of process, for example, requires a defendant to answer within a \ncertain number of days; an agent’s failure to communicate to the principal that a summons has been \nserved may bar the principal’s right to defend a lawsuit. The imputation to the principal of knowledge \npossessed by the agent is strict: even where the agent is acting adversely to the principal’s interests—for \nexample, by trying to defraud his employer—a third party may still rely on notification to the agent, unless \nthe third party knows the agent is acting adversely. \n \n“Shop Rights” Doctrine \nIn Grip Nut Co. v. Sharp, Sharp made a deal with Grip Nut Company that in return for a salary and \nbonuses as company president, he would assign to the company any inventions he made. [4] When the five-\nyear employment contract expired, Sharp continued to serve as chief executive officer, but no new \ncontract was negotiated concerning either pay or rights to inventions. During the next ten years, Sharp \ninvented a number of new products and developed new machinery to manufacture them; patent rights \nwent to the company. However, he made one invention with two other employees and they assigned the \npatent to him. A third employee invented a safety device and also assigned the patent to Sharp. At one \ntime, Sharp’s son invented a leakproof bolt and a process to manufacture it; these, too, were assigned to \nSharp. These inventions were developed in the company’s plants at its expense. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n386 \nWhen Sharp died, his family claimed the rights to the inventions on which Sharp held assignments and \nsued the company, which used the inventions, for patent infringement. The family reasoned that after the \nexpiration of the employment contract, Sharp was employed only in a managerial capacity, not as an \ninventor. The court disagreed and invoked the shop rights doctrine, under which an invention \n“developed and perfected in [a company’s] plant with its time, materials, and appliances, and wholly at its",

Nevertheless, the principal has a number of contractually related obligations toward his \nagent. \n \nGeneral Contract Duties \nThese duties are analogues of many of the agent’s duties that we have just examined. In brief, a principal \nhas a duty “to refrain from unreasonably interfering with [an agent’s] work.” [5] The principal is allowed, \nhowever, to compete with the agent unless the agreement specifically prohibits it. The principal has a duty \nto inform his agent of risks of physical harm or pecuniary loss that inhere in the agent’s performance of \nassigned tasks. Failure to warn an agent that travel in a particular neighborhood required by the job may \nbe dangerous (a fact unknown to the agent but known to the principal) could under common law subject \nthe principal to a suit for damages if the agent is injured while in the neighborhood performing her job. A \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n387 \nprincipal is obliged to render accounts of monies due to agents; a principal’s obligation to do so depends \non a variety of factors, including the degree of independence of the agent, the method of compensation, \nand the customs of the particular business. An agent’s reputation is no less valuable than a principal’s, \nand so an agent is under no obligation to continue working for one who sullies it. \n \nEmployment at Will \nUnder the traditional “employment-at-will” doctrine, an employee who is not hired for a specific period \ncan be fired at any time, for any reason (except bad reasons: an employee cannot be fired, for example, for \nreporting that his employer’s paper mill is illegally polluting groundwater). This doctrine has been much \ncriticized. \n \nDuty to Indemnify \nAgents commonly spend money pursuing the principal’s business. Unless the agreement explicitly \nprovides otherwise, the principal has a duty to indemnify or reimburse the agent. A familiar form of \nindemnity is the employee expense account. \n \nTort and Workers’ Compensation Duties \nThe employer owes the employee—any employee, not just agents—certain statutorily imposed tort and \nworkers’ compensation duties. \n \nBackground to Workers’ Compensation \nAndy, who works in a dynamite factory, negligently stores dynamite in the wrong shed. Andy warns his \nfellow employee Bill that he has done so. Bill lights up a cigarette near the shed anyway, a spark lands on \nthe ground, the dynamite explodes, and Bill is injured. May Bill sue his employer to recover damages? At \ncommon law, the answer would be no—three times no. First, the “fellow-servant” rule would bar recovery \nbecause the employer was held not to be responsible for torts committed by one employee against \nanother. Second, Bill’s failure to heed Andy’s warning and his decision to smoke near the dynamite \namounted to contributory negligence. Hence even if the dynamite had been negligently stored by the \nemployer rather than by a fellow employee, the claim would have been dismissed. Third, the courts might \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n388 \nhave held that Bill had “assumed the risk”: since he was aware of the dangers, it would not be fair to \nsaddle the employer with the burden of Bill’s actions. \n \nThe three common-law rules just mentioned ignited intense public fury by the turn of the twentieth \ncentury.

The \nemployer therefore has reason to assert the injured employee is not eligible for compensation. Recurring \nlegal issues include the following: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n392 \n• \nIs the injury work related? As a general rule, on-the-job injuries are covered no matter what their \nrelationship to the employee’s specific duties. Although injuries resulting from drunkenness or \nfighting are not generally covered, there are circumstances under which they will be, as Section \n9.3.2 \"Employee versus Independent Contractor\" shows. \n• \nIs the injured person an employee? Courts are apt to be liberal in construing statutes to include \nthose who might not seem to be employed. InBetts v. Ann Arbor Public Schools, a University of \nMichigan student majoring in physical education was a student teacher in a junior high \nschool. [7] During a four-month period, he taught two physical education courses. On the last day \nof his student teaching, he walked into the locker room and thirty of his students grabbed him \nand tossed him into the swimming pool. This was traditional, but he “didn’t feel like going in that \nmorning” and put up a struggle that ended with a whistle on an elastic band hitting him in the \neye, which he subsequently lost as a result of the injury. He filed a workers’ compensation claim. \nThe school board argued that he could not be classified as an employee because he received no \npay. Since he was injured by students—not considered agents of the school—he would probably \nhave been unsuccessful in filing a tort suit; hence the workers’ compensation claim was his only \nchance of recompense. The state workers’ compensation appeal board ruled against the school on \nthe ground that payment in money was not required: “Plaintiff was paid in the form of training, \ncollege credits towards graduation, and meeting of the prerequisites of a state provisional \ncertificate.” The state supreme court affirmed the award. \n• \nHow palpable must the “injury” be? A difficult issue is whether a worker is entitled to \ncompensation for psychological injury, including cumulative trauma. Until the 1970s, insurance \ncompanies and compensation boards required physical injury before making an award. Claims \nthat job stresses led to nervous breakdowns or other mental disorders were rejected. But most \ncourts have liberalized the definition of injury and now recognize that psychological trauma can \nbe real and that job stress can bring it on, as shown by the discussion of Wolfe v. Sibley, Lindsay \n& Curr Co. in Section 9.3.4 \"Workers’ Compensation: What “Injuries” Are Compensable?\". \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n393 \nThe agent owes the principal two categories of duties: fiduciary and general. The fiduciary duty is the duty to \nact always in the interest of the principal; the duty here includes that to avoid self-dealing and to preserve \nconfidential information. The general duty owed by the agent encompasses the sorts of obligations any \nemployee might have: the duty of skill and care, of good conduct, to keep and render accounts, to not \nattempt the impossible or impracticable, to obey, and to give information. The shop rights doctrine provides \nthat inventions made by an employee using the employer’s resources and on the employer’s time belong to \nthe employer. \nThe principal owes the agent duties too. These may be categorized as contract and tort duties. The contract \nduties are to warn the agent of hazards associated with the job, to avoid interfering with the agent’s \nperformance of his job, to render accounts of money due the agent, and to indemnify the agent for business \nexpenses according to their agreement. The tort duty owed by the principal to the agent—employee—is \nprimarily the statutorily imposed duty to provide workers’ compensation for injuries sustained on the job. In \nreaction to common-law defenses that often exonerated the employer from liability for workers’ injuries, the \nearly twentieth century saw the rise of workers’ compensation statutes. These require the employer to \nprovide no-fault insurance coverage for any injury sustained by the employee on the job. Because the \nemployer’s insurance costs are claims rated (i.e., the cost of insurance depends on how many claims are \nmade), the employer scrutinizes claims. A number of recurring legal issues arise: Is the injury work related? Is \nthe injured person an employee? What constitutes an “injury”? \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Judge Learned Hand, a famous early-twentieth-century jurist (1872–1961), said, “The fiduciary duty is not \nthe ordinary morals of the marketplace.” How does the fiduciary duty differ from “the ordinary morals of \nthe marketplace”? Why does the law impose a fiduciary duty on the agent? \n2. What are the nonfiduciary duties owed by the agent to the principal? \n3. What contract duties are owed by the principal to the agent?",

The fact \nthat Microsoft did not intend to provide benefits to persons who it thought were freelancers or \nindependent contractors sheds little or no light on that question.… \n \nMicrosoft’s argument, drawing a distinction between common-law employees on the basis of the manner \nin which they were paid, is subject to the same vice as its more general argument. Microsoft regarded the \nplaintiffs as independent contractors during the relevant period and learned of their common-law-\nemployee status only after the IRS examination. They were paid through the accounts receivable \ndepartment rather than the payroll department because of Microsoft’s mistaken view as to their legal \nstatus. Accordingly, Microsoft cannot now contend that the fact that they were paid through the accounts \nreceivable department demonstrates that the company intended to deny them the benefits received by all \ncommon-law employees regardless of their actual employment status. Indeed, Microsoft has pointed to no \nevidence suggesting that it ever denied eligibility to any employees, whom it understood to be common-\nlaw employees, by paying them through the accounts receivable department or otherwise. \n \nWe therefore construe the ambiguity in the plan against Microsoft and hold that the plaintiffs are eligible \nto participate under the terms of the SPP. \n \n[Next, regarding the ESPP] we hold that the plaintiffs…are covered by the specific provisions of the ESPP. \nWe apply the “objective manifestation theory of contracts,” which requires us to “impute an intention \ncorresponding to the reasonable meaning of a person’s words and acts.” [Citation] Through its \nincorporation of the tax code provision into the plan, Microsoft manifested an objective intent to make all \ncommon-law employees, and hence the plaintiffs, eligible for participation.

The only testimony on this matter was \ngiven by Dr. Grinols who stated unequivocally that the discovery of her superior’s body was the competent \nproducing cause of her condition.

Know that the principal may also be liable—even if the agent had no authority—if the principal ratifies the \nagent’s contract after the fact. \n \n \nPrincipal’s Contract Liability Requires That Agent Had Authority \nThe key to determining whether a principal is liable for contracts made by his agent is authority: was the \nagent authorized to negotiate the agreement and close the deal? Obviously, it would not be sensible to \nhold a contractor liable to pay for a whole load of lumber merely because a stranger wandered into the \nlumberyard saying, “I’m an agent for ABC Contractors; charge this to their account.” To be liable, the \nprincipal must have authorized the agent in some manner to act in his behalf, and that authorization must \nbe communicated to the third party by the principal. \n \nTypes of Authority \nThere are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent (see Figure 10.1 \"Types of Authority\"). \nWe will consider each in turn. \n \nExpress Authority \nThe strongest form of authority is that which is expressly granted, often in written form. The principal \nconsents to the agent’s actions, and the third party may then rely on the document attesting to the agent’s \nauthority to deal on behalf of the principal. One common form of express authority is the standard \nsignature card on file with banks allowing corporate agents to write checks on the company’s credit. The \nprincipal bears the risk of any wrongful action of his agent, as demonstrated in Allen A. Funt Productions, \nInc. v. Chemical Bank. [1] Allen A. Funt submitted to his bank through his production company various \ncertificates permitting his accountant to use the company’s checking accounts. [2] In fact, for several years \nthe accountant embezzled money from the company by writing checks to himself and depositing them in \nhis own account. The company sued its bank, charging it with negligence, apparently for failing to monitor \nthe amount of money taken by the accountant. But the court dismissed the negligence complaint, citing a \nstate statute based on the common-law agency principle that a third party is entitled to rely on the express \nauthorization given to an agent; in this case, the accountant drew checks on the account within the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n418 \nmonetary limits contained in the signature cards on file with the bank. Letters of introduction and work \norders are other types of express authority. \n \nFigure 10.1 Types of Authority \n \n \nImplied Authority \nNot every detail of an agent’s work can be spelled out. It is impossible to delineate step-by-step the duties \nof a general agent; at best, a principal can set forth only the general nature of the duties that the agent is \nto perform. Even a special agent’s duties are difficult to describe in such detail as to leave him without \ndiscretion. If express authority were the only valid kind, there would be no efficient way to use an agent, \nboth because the effort to describe the duties would be too great and because the third party would be \nreluctant to deal with him. \nBut the law permits authority to be “implied” by the relationship of the parties, the nature and customs of \nthe business, the circumstances surrounding the act in question, the wording of the agency contract, and \nthe knowledge that the agent has of facts relevant to the assignment. The general rule is that the agent has \nimplied or “incidental” authority to perform acts incidental to or reasonably necessary to carrying out the \ntransaction. Thus if a principal instructs her agent to “deposit a check in the bank today,” the agent has \nauthority to drive to the bank unless the principal specifically prohibits the agent from doing so. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n419 \nThe theory of implied authority is especially important to business in the realm of the business \nmanager, who may be charged with running the entire business operation or only a small part of it. In \neither event, the business manager has a relatively large domain of implied authority. He can buy goods \nand services; hire, supervise, and fire employees; sell or junk inventory; take in receipts and pay debts; \nand in general, direct the ordinary operations of the business. The full extent of the manager’s authority \ndepends on the circumstances—what is customary in the particular industry, in the particular business, \nand among the individuals directly concerned. \n \nOn the other hand, a manager does not have implicit authority to undertake unusual or extraordinary \nactions on behalf of his principal. In the absence of express permission, an agent may not sell part of the \nbusiness, start a new business, change the nature of the business, incur debt (unless borrowing is integral \nto the business, as in banking, for example), or move the business premises. For example, the owner of a \nhotel appoints Andy manager; Andy decides to rename the hotel and commissions an artist to prepare a",

However, they can be held liable for \nfailing to control children known to be dangerous. \n \nMost states have statutorily changed the common-law rule, making parents responsible for willful or \nmalicious tortious acts of their children whether or not they are known to be mischief-makers. Thus the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n429 \nIllinois Parental Responsibility Law provides the following: “The parent or legal guardian of an \nunemancipated minor who resides with such parent or legal guardian is liable for actual damages for the \nwillful or malicious acts of such minor which cause injury to a person or property.” [5] Several other states \nimpose a monetary limit on such liability. \n \nOther Torts Governed by Statute or Regulation \nThere are certain types of conduct that statutes or regulation attempt to control by placing the burden of \nliability on those presumably in a position to prevent the unwanted conduct. An example is the \n“Dramshop Act,” which in many states subjects the owner of a bar to liability if the bar continues to serve \nan intoxicated patron who later is involved in an accident while intoxicated. Another example involves the \nsale of adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs: the employer of one who sells such may be liable, even if \nthe employer did not know of the sales. \n \nPrincipal’s Criminal Liability \nAs a general proposition, a principal will not be held liable for an agent’s unauthorized criminal acts if the \ncrimes are those requiring specific intent. Thus a department store proprietor who tells his chief buyer to \nget the “best deal possible” on next fall’s fashions is not liable if the buyer steals clothes from the \nmanufacturer. A principal will, however, be liable if the principal directed, approved, or participated in \nthe crime. Cases here involve, for example, a corporate principal’s liability for agents’ activity in antitrust \nviolations—price-fixing is one such violation. \n \nThere is a narrow exception to the broad policy of immunity. Courts have ruled that under certain \nregulatory statutes and regulations, an agent’s criminality may be imputed to the principal, just as civil \nliability is imputed under Dramshop Acts. These include pure food and drug acts, speeding ordinances, \nbuilding regulations, child labor rules, and minimum wage and maximum hour legislation. Misdemeanor \ncriminal liability may be imposed upon corporations and individual employees for the sale or shipment of \nadulterated food in interstate commerce, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant may have had no \nactual knowledge that the food was adulterated at the time the sale or shipment was made. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n430 \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe principal will be liable for the employee’s torts in two circumstances: first, if the principal was directly \nresponsible, as in hiring a person the principal knew or should have known was incompetent or dangerous; \nsecond, if the employee committed the tort in the scope of business for the principal. This is the master-\nservant doctrine or respondeat superior. It imposes vicarious liability on the employer: the master (employer) \nwill be liable if the employee was in the zone of activity creating a risk for the employer (“zone of risk” test), \nthat is—generally—if the employee was where he was supposed to be, when he was supposed to be there, \nand the incident arose out of the employee’s interest (however perverted) in promoting the employer’s \nbusiness. \nSpecial cases of vicarious liability arise in several circumstances. For example, the owner of an automobile may \nbe liable for torts committed by one who borrows it, or if it is—even if indirectly—used for family purposes. \nParents are, by statute in many states, liable for their children’s torts. Similarly by statute, the sellers and \nemployers of sellers of alcohol or adulterated or short-weight foodstuffs may be liable. The employer of one \nwho commits a crime is not usually liable unless the employer put the employee up to the crime or knew that \na crime was being committed. But some prophylactic statutes impose liability on the employer for the \nemployee’s crime—even if the employee had no intention to commit it—as a means to force the employer to \nprevent such actions. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Understand the agent’s personal liability for tort. \n2. Understand the agent’s personal liability for contract. \n3. Recognize the ways the agency relationship is terminated. \n \n \nAgent’s Personal Liability for Torts and Contracts \nTort Liability \nThat a principal is held vicariously liable and must pay damages to an injured third person does not \nexcuse the agent who actually committed the tortious acts. A person is always liable for his or her own \ntorts (unless the person is insane, involuntarily intoxicated, or acting under extreme duress). The agent is \npersonally liable for his wrongful acts and must reimburse the principal for any damages the principal was \nforced to pay, as long as the principal did not authorize the wrongful conduct. The agent directed to \ncommit a tort remains liable for his own conduct but is not obliged to repay the principal. Liability as an \nagent can be burdensome, sometimes perhaps more burdensome than as a principal. The latter normally \npurchases insurance to cover against wrongful acts of agents, but liability insurance policies frequently do \nnot cover the employee’s personal liability if the employee is named in a lawsuit individually. Thus \ndoctors’ and hospitals’ malpractice policies protect a doctor from both her own mistakes and those of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n432 \nnurses and others that the doctor would be responsible for; nurses, however, might need their own \ncoverage. In the absence of insurance, an agent is at serious risk in this lawsuit-conscious age. The risk is \nnot total. The agent is not liable for torts of other agents unless he is personally at fault—for example, by \nnegligently supervising a junior or by giving faulty instructions. For example, an agent, the general \nmanager for a principal, hires Brown as a subordinate. Brown is competent to do the job but by failing to \nexercise proper control over a machine negligently injures Ted, a visitor to the premises. The principal \nand Brown are liable to Ted, but the agent is not. \n \nContract Liability \nIt makes sense that an agent should be liable for her own torts; it would be a bad social policy indeed if a \nperson could escape tort liability based on her own fault merely because she acted in an agency capacity. It \nalso makes sense that—as is the general rule—an agent is not liable on contracts she makes on the \nprincipal’s behalf; the agent is not a party to a contract made by the agent on behalf of the principal. No \npublic policy would be served by imposing liability, and in many cases it would not make sense. Suppose \nan agent contracts to buy $25 million of rolled aluminum for a principal, an airplane manufacturer. The \nagent personally could not reasonably perform such contract, and it is not intended by the parties that she \nshould be liable. (Although the rule is different in England, where an agent residing outside the country is \nliable even if it is clear that he is signing in an agency capacity.) But there are three exceptions to this rule: \n(1) if the agent is undisclosed or partially disclosed, (2) if the agent lacks authority or exceeds it, or (3) if \nthe agent entered into the contract in a personal capacity. We consider each situation. \n \nAgent for Undisclosed or Partially Disclosed Principal \nAn agent need not, and frequently will not, inform the person with whom he is negotiating that he is \nacting on behalf of a principal. The secret principal is usually called an “undisclosed principal.” Or the \nagent may tell the other person that he is acting as an agent but not disclose the principal’s name, in \nwhich event the principal is “partially disclosed.” To understand the difficulties that may occur, consider \nthe following hypothetical but common example. A real estate developer known for building amusement \nparks wants to acquire several parcels of land to construct a new park. He wants to keep his identity secret \nto hold down the land cost.

The judge’s reason for so doing was that the plaintiff, in his contract action, failed to introduce \nsufficient evidence tending to prove that the bank officer who made the agreement with which the plaintiff \nsought to charge the bank had any authority to make it. Upon review of the record we are of opinion that \nthere was evidence which, if believed, warranted a finding that the bank officer had the requisite authority \nor that the bank officer had apparent authority to make the agreement in controversy. We therefore \nreverse the judgment. \n \nFor approximately ten years prior to 1975, Harold Kanavos and his brother borrowed money on at least \ntwenty occasions from the Hancock Bank & Trust Company (the Bank), and, during that period, the loan \nofficer with whom Kanavos always dealt was James M. Brown. The aggregate loans made by the Bank to \nKanavos at any given time went as high as $800,000. \n \nOver that same decade, Brown’s responsibilities at the Bank grew, and he had become executive vice-\npresident. Brown was also the chief loan officer for the Bank, which had fourteen or fifteen branches in \naddition to its head office. Physically, Brown’s office was at the head office, toward the rear of the main \nbanking floor, opposite the office of the president—whose name was Kelley. Often Brown would tell \nKanavos that he had to check an aspect of a loan transaction with Kelley, but Kelley always backed Brown \nup on those occasions. \n… \n[The plaintiff, Harold Kanavos, entered into an agreement with the defendant Bank whereby stock owned \nby the Kanavos brothers was sold to the Bank and the plaintiff was given an option to repurchase the \nstock. Kanavos’ suit against the Bank was based on an amendment to the agreement offered by Brown.] \n \nKanavos was never permitted to introduce in evidence the terms of the offer Brown made. That offer was \ncontained in a writing, dated July 16, 1976, on bank letterhead, which read as follows: “This letter is to \nconfirm our conversation regarding your option to re-purchase the subject property.

The court determined that George’s was properly \ndismissed because Pep Line, Carey’s employer, was an independent contractor over which George’s had \nno control.] \n \nThe principal question, therefore, is whether the evidence discloses any other basis upon which a jury \ncould reasonably find Pep Line, the employer of Carey, liable for the assault. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n443 \n \nMichael Carey was in the employment of the defendant Pep Line as a deliveryman. He was authorized to \nmake the delivery of the mattress and springs plaintiff’s sister had bought. He gained access to the \napartment only upon a showing of the delivery receipt for the merchandise. His employment \ncontemplated that he visit and enter that particular apartment. Though the apartment was not owned by \nnor in the control of his employer, it was nevertheless a place he was expected by his employer to enter. \n \nAfter Carey entered, under the credentials of his employment and the delivery receipt, a dispute arose \nnaturally and immediately between him and the plaintiff about two items of great significance in \nconnection with his job. These items were the request of the plaintiff, the customer’s agent, to inspect the \nmattress and springs before payment (which would require their being brought upstairs before the \npayment was made), and Carey’s insistence on getting cash rather than a check. \n \nThe dispute arose out of the very transaction which had brought Carey to the premises, and, according to \nthe plaintiff’s evidence, out of the employer’s instructions to get cash only before delivery. \n \nOn the face of things, Pep Line Trucking Company, Inc. is liable, under two previous decisions of the \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. [Citation (1953)] held a taxi owner liable for \ndamages (including a broken leg) sustained by a customer who had been run over by the taxi in pursuit of \na dispute between the driver and the customer about a fare. [Citation (1939)], held a restaurant owner \nliable to a restaurant patron who was beaten with a stick by a restaurant employee, after a disagreement \nover the service. The theory was that: \n \nIt is well established that an employer may be held responsible in tort for assaults committed by \nan employee while he is acting within the scope of his employment, even though he may act \nwantonly and contrary to his employer’s instructions. [Citations] “…having placed [the \nemployee] in charge and committed the management of the business to his care, defendants may \nnot escape liability either on the ground of his infirmity of temperament or because, under the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n444 \ninfluence of passion aroused by plaintiff’s threat to report the circumstances, he went beyond the \nordinary line of duty and inflicted the injury shown in this case. [Citations]” \n \nMunick v. City of Durham ([Citation], Supreme Court of North Carolina, 1921), though not a binding \nprecedent, is informative and does show that the theory of liability advanced by the plaintiff is by no \nmeans recent in origin. The plaintiff, Munick, a Russian born Jew, testified that he went to the Durham, \nNorth Carolina city water company office on April 17, 1919, and offered to pay his bill with “three paper \ndollars, one silver dollar, and fifty cents in pennies.” The pennies were in a roll “like the bank fixes them.” \nThe clerk gave a receipt and the plaintiff prepared to leave the office. The office manager came into the \nroom, saw the clerk counting the pennies, became enraged at the situation, shoved the pennies onto the \nfloor and ordered Munick to pick them up. Bolton, the manager, “locked the front door and took me by \nthe jacket and called me ‘God damned Jew,’ and said, ‘I want only bills.’ I did not say anything and he hit \nme in the face. I did not resist, and the door was locked and I could not get out.…” With the door locked, \nBolton then repeatedly choked and beat the plaintiff, finally extracted a bill in place of the pennies, and \nordered him off the premises with injuries including finger marks on his neck that could be seen for eight \nor ten days. Bolton was convicted of unlawful assault [but the case against the water company was \ndismissed]. \n \nThe North Carolina Supreme Court (Clark, C.

If the instrumentalities of assault had not included \nrape, the case would provoke no particular curiosity nor interest because it comes within all the classic \nrequirements for recovery against the master.

Who decides what the facts are in a lawsuit? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nA contract made by an agent on behalf of the principal legally binds the principal. Three types of authority \nmay bind the principal: (1) express authority—that which is actually given and spelled out, (2) implied \nauthority—that which may fairly be inferred from the parties’ relationship and which is incidental to the \nagent’s express authority, and (3) apparent authority—that which reasonably appears to a third party \nunder the circumstances to have been given by the principal. Even in the absence of authority, a principal \nmay ratify the agent’s acts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n452 \nThe principal may be liable for tortious acts of the agent but except under certain regulatory statutes may \nnot be held criminally liable for criminal acts of agents not prompted by the principal. Under the doctrine \nof respondeat superior, a principal is generally liable for acts by a servant within the scope of employment. \nA principal usually will not be held liable for acts of nonservant agents that cause physical damage, \nalthough he will be held liable for nonphysical torts, such as misrepresentation. The principal will not be \nheld liable for tortious acts of independent contractors, although the principal may be liable for injuries \nresulting from his failure to act in situations in which he was not legally permitted to delegate a duty to \nact. Whenever an agent is acting to further the principal’s business interests, the principal will be held \nvicariously liable for the agent’s intentional torts. What constitutes scope of employment is not easy to \ndetermine; the modern trend is to hold a principal liable for the conduct of an agent if it was foreseeable \nthat the agent might act as he did. \n \nMost states have special rules of vicarious liability for special situations; for example, liability of an \nautomobile owner for use by another. Spouses are not vicariously liable for each other, nor are parents for \nchildren, except for failing to control children known to be dangerous.",

In this chapter we study partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability \ncompanies, and we touch on joint ventures and business trusts. \nWhen two or more people form their own business or professional practice, they usually consider \nbecoming partners. Partnership law defines a partnership as “the association of two or more persons to \ncarry on as co-owners a business for profit…whether or not the persons intend to form a \npartnership.” [1] In 2011, there were more than three million business firms in the United States as \npartnerships (see Table 11.1 \"Selected Data: Number of US Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, and \nLimited Liability Companies\", showing data to 2006), and partnerships are a common form of \norganization among accountants, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. When we use the word \npartnership, we are referring to the general business partnership.

Partnership law and tax law permit an investor to \nput capital into a limited partnership and realize tax benefits without liability for the acts of the general \npartners. \n \nEven if you do not plan to work within a partnership, it can be important to understand the law that \ngoverns it. Why? Because it is possible to become someone’s partner without intending to or even \nrealizing that a partnership has been created. Knowledge of the law can help you avoid partnership \nliability. \nHistory of Partnership Law \nThrough the Twentieth Century \nPartnership is an ancient form of business enterprise, and special laws governing partnerships date as far \nback as 2300 BC, when the Code of Hammurabi explicitly regulated the relations between partners. \nPartnership was an important part of Roman law, and it played a significant role in the law merchant, the \ninternational commercial law of the Middle Ages. \n \nIn the nineteenth century, in both England and the United States, partnership was a popular vehicle for \nbusiness enterprise. But the law governing it was jumbled. Common-law principles were mixed with \nequitable standards, and the result was considerable confusion. Parliament moved to reduce the \nuncertainty by adopting the Partnership Act of 1890, but codification took longer in the United States. The \nCommissioners on Uniform State Laws undertook the task at the turn of the twentieth century. The \nUniform Partnership Act (UPA), completed in 1914, and the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA), \ncompleted in 1916, were the basis of partnership law for many decades. UPA and ULPA were adopted by \nall states except Louisiana. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n459 \nThe Current State of Partnership Law \nDespite its name, UPA was not enacted uniformly among the states; moreover, it had some shortcomings. \nSo the states tinkered with it, and by the 1980s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \nLaws (NCCUL) determined that a revised version was in order. An amended UPA appeared in 1992, and \nfurther amendments were promulgated in 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. The NCCUL reports that thirty-\nnine states have adopted some version of the revised act. This chapter will discuss the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA) as promulgated in 1997, but because not all jurisdictions have not adopted it, \nwhere RUPA makes significant changes, the original 1914 UPA will also be considered. [2] The NCCUL \nobserves in its “prefatory note” to the 1997 act: “The Revised Act is largely a series of ‘default rules’ that \ngovern the relations among partners in situations they have not addressed in a partnership agreement. \nThe primary focus of RUPA is the small, often informal, partnership. Larger partnerships generally have a \npartnership agreement addressing, and often modifying, many of the provisions of the partnership act.” [3] \n \nEntity Theory \nMeaning of “Legal Entity” \nA significant difference between a partnership and most other kinds of business organization relates to \nwhether, and the extent to which, the business is a legal entity. A legal entity is a person or group that the \nlaw recognizes as having legal rights, such as the right to own and dispose of property, to sue and be sued, \nand to enter into contracts; the entity theory is the concept of a business firm as a legal person, with \nexistence and accountability separate from its owners. When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno.

When individuals carry out a common enterprise \nas partners, a threshold legal question is whether the partnership is a legal entity. The common law said \nno. In other words, under the common-law theory, a partnership was but a convenient name for an \naggregate of individuals, and the rights and duties recognized and imposed by law are those of the \nindividual partners. By contrast, the mercantile theory of the law merchant held that a partnership is a \nlegal entity that can have rights and duties independent of those of its members. \n \nDuring the drafting of the 1914 UPA, a debate raged over which theory to adopt. The drafters resolved the \ndebate through a compromise. In Section 6(1), UPA provides a neutral definition of partnership (“an \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n460 \nassociation of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit”) and retained the \ncommon-law theory that a partnership is an aggregation of individuals—the aggregate theory. \n \nRUPA moved more toward making partnerships entities. According to the NCCUL, “The Revised Act \nenhances the entity treatment of partnerships to achieve simplicity for state law purposes, particularly in \nmatters concerning title to partnership property. RUPA does not, however, relentlessly apply the entity \napproach. The aggregate approach is retained for some purposes, such as partners’ joint and several \nliability.” [4] Section 201(a) provides, “A partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.” [5] \nEntity Characteristics of a Partnership \nUnder RUPA, then, a partnership has entity characteristics, but the partners remain guarantors of \npartnership obligations, as always—that is the partners’ joint and several liability noted in the previous \nparagraph (and discussed further in Chapter 12 \"Partnership Operation and Termination\"). This is a very \nimportant point and a primary weakness of the partnership form: all partners are, and each one of them \nis, ultimately personally liable for the obligations of the partnership, without limit, which includes \npersonal and unlimited liability. This personal liability is very distasteful, and it has been abolished, \nsubject to some exceptions, with limited partnerships and limited liability companies, as discussed \nin Chapter 13 \"Hybrid Business Forms\". And, of course, the owners of corporations are also not generally \nliable for the corporation’s obligations, which is a major reason for the corporate form’s popularity. \n \nFor Accounting Purposes \nUnder both versions of the law, the partnership may keep business records as if it were a separate entity, \nand its accountants may treat it as such for purposes of preparing income statements and balance sheets. \n \nFor Purposes of Taxation \nUnder both versions of the law, partnerships are not taxable entities, so they do not pay income taxes. \nInstead, each partner’s distributive share, which includes income or other gain, loss, deductions, and \ncredits, must be included in the partner’s personal income tax return, whether or not the share is actually \ndistributed. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n461 \nFor Purposes of Litigation \nIn litigation, the aggregate theory causes some inconvenience in naming and serving partnership \ndefendants: under UPA, lawsuits to enforce a partnership contract or some other right must be filed in the \nname of all the partners. Similarly, to sue a partnership, the plaintiff must name and sue each of the \npartners. This cumbersome procedure was modified in many states, which enacted special statutes \nexpressly permitting suits by and against partnerships in the firm name. In suits on a claim in federal \ncourt, a partnership may sue and be sued in its common name. The move by RUPA to make partnerships \nentities changed very little. Certainly it provides that “a partnership may sue and be sued in the name of \nthe partnership”—that’s handy where the plaintiff hopes for a judgment against the partnership, without \nrecourse to the individual partners’ personal assets. [6] But a plaintiff must still name the partnership and \nthe partners individually to have access to both estates, the partnership and the individuals’: “A judgment \nagainst a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may \nnot be satisfied from a partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.” [7] \n \nFor Purposes of Owning Real Estate \nAggregate theory concepts bedeviled property co-ownership issues, so UPA finessed the issue by stating",

First, their business is a partnership, not a corporation, and should not be described as one. \nSecond, the name is deceptive because it is the name of an existing business. Furthermore, if not \nregistered, the name would violate the assumed or fictitious name statutes of most states. These require \nthat anyone doing business under a name other than his real name register the name, together with the \nnames and addresses of the proprietors, in some public office. (Often, the statutes require the proprietors \nto publish this information in the newspapers when the business is started.) As Loomis v. \nWhitehead in Section 11.3.2 \"Creation of a Partnership: Registering the Name\" shows, if a business fails to \ncomply with the statute, it could find that it will be unable to file suit to enforce its contracts. \nCreation of Implied Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n466 \nAn implied partnership exists when in fact there are two or more persons carrying on a business as co-\nowners for profit. For example, Carlos decides to paint houses during his summer break. He gathers some \nmaterials and gets several jobs. He hires Wally as a helper. Wally is very good, and pretty soon both of \nthem are deciding what jobs to do and how much to charge, and they are splitting the profits. They have \nan implied partnership, without intending to create a partnership at all. \n \nTests of Partnership Existence \nBut how do we know whether an implied partnership has been created? Obviously, we know if there is an \nexpress agreement. But partnerships can come into existence quite informally, indeed, without any \nformality—they can be created accidentally. In contrast to the corporation, which is the creature of \nstatute, partnership is a catchall term for a large variety of working relationships, and frequently, \nuncertainties arise about whether or not a particular relationship is that of partnership. The law can \nreduce the uncertainty in advance only at the price of severely restricting the flexibility of people to \nassociate. As the chief drafter of the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA, 1914) explained, \n \nAll other business associations are statutory in origin. They are formed by the happening of an \nevent designated in a statute as necessary to their formation. In corporations this act may be the \nissuing of a charter by the proper officer of the state; in limited partnerships, the filing by the \nassociates of a specified document in a public office. On the other hand, an infinite number of \ncombinations of circumstances may result in co-ownership of a business. Partnership is the \nresiduum, including all forms of co-ownership, of a business except those business associations \norganized under a specific statute. [2] \n \n \n \nFigure 11.1 Partnership Tests \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n467 \n \n \nBecause it is frequently important to know whether a partnership exists (as when a creditor has dealt with \nonly one party but wishes to also hold others liable by claiming they were partners, see Section 11.3.1 \n\"Tests of Partnership Existence\", Chaiken v. Employment Security Commission), a number of tests have \nbeen established that are clues to the existence of a partnership (see Figure 11.1 \"Partnership Tests\"). We \nreturn to the definition of a partnership: “the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners \na business for profit[.]” The three elements are (1) the association of persons, (2) as co-owners, (3) for \nprofit. \n \nAssociation of Persons \nThis element is pretty obvious. A partnership is a contractual agreement among persons, so the persons \ninvolved need to have capacity to contract. But RUPA does not provide that only natural persons can be \npartners; it defines person as follows: “‘Person’ means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, \ntrust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision, agency, or \ninstrumentality, or any other legal or commercial entity.” [3] Thus unless state law precludes it, a \ncorporation can be a partner in a partnership. The same is true under UPA. \n \nCo-owners of a Business \nIf what two or more people own is clearly a business—including capital assets, contracts with employees \nor agents, an income stream, and debts incurred on behalf of the operation—a partnership exists. A \ntougher question arises when two or more persons co-own property. Do they automatically become \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n468 \npartners? The answer can be important: if one of the owners while doing business pertinent to the \nproperty injures a stranger, the latter could sue the other owners if there is a partnership. \n \nCo-ownership comes in many guises. The four most common are joint tenancy, tenancy in common, \ntenancy by the entireties, and community property. In joint tenancy, the owners hold the property under a \nsingle instrument, such as a deed, and if one dies, the others automatically become owners of the",

If Chaiken’s partnership argument fails he has no \nsecondary position and he fails to meet his burden. \n \nChaiken contends that he and his “partners”: \n1. properly registered the partnership name and names of partners in the prothonotary’s office, in \naccordance with [the relevant statute], [1] \n2. properly filed federal partnership information returns and paid federal taxes quarterly on an estimated \nbasis, and \n3. duly executed partnership agreements. \n \nOf the three factors, the last is most important. Agreements of “partnership” were executed between \nChaiken and Mr. Strazella, a barber in the shop, and between Chaiken and Mr. Spitzer, similarly situated. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n474 \nThe agreements were nearly identical. The first paragraph declared the creation of a partnership and the \nlocation of business. The second provided that Chaiken would provide barber chair, supplies, and licenses, \nwhile the other partner would provide tools of the trade. The paragraph also declared that upon \ndissolution of the partnership, ownership of items would revert to the party providing them. The third \nparagraph declared that the income of the partnership would be divided 30% for Chaiken, 70% for \nStrazella; 20% for Chaiken and 80% for Spitzer. The fourth paragraph declared that all partnership policy \nwould be decided by Chaiken, whose decision was final. The fifth paragraph forbade assignment of the \nagreement without permission of Chaiken. The sixth paragraph required Chaiken to hold and distribute \nall receipts. The final paragraph stated hours of work for Strazella and Spitzer and holidays. \n \nThe mere existence of an agreement labeled “partnership” agreement and the characterization of \nsignatories as “partners” docs not conclusively prove the existence of a partnership. Rather, the intention \nof the parties, as explained by the wording of the agreement, is paramount. \n \nA partnership is defined as an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for \nprofit. As co-owners of a business, partners have an equal right in the decision making process. But this \nright may be abrogated by agreement of the parties without destroying the partnership concept, provided \nother partnership elements are present. \n \nThus, while paragraph four reserves for Chaiken all right to determine partnership policy, it is not \nstanding alone, fatal to the partnership concept. Co-owners should also contribute valuable consideration \nfor the creation of the business. Under paragraph two, however, Chaiken provides the barber chair (and \nimplicitly the barber shop itself), mirror, licenses and linen, while the other partners merely provide their \ntools and labor—nothing more than any barber-employee would furnish. Standing alone, however, mere \ncontribution of work and skill can be valuable consideration for a partnership agreement. \n \nPartnership interests may be assignable, although it is not a violation of partnership law to prohibit \nassignment in a partnership agreement. Therefore, paragraph five on assignment of partnership interests \ndoes not violate the partnership concept. On the other hand, distribution of partnership assets to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n475 \npartners upon dissolution is only allowed after all partnership liabilities are satisfied. But paragraph two \nof the agreement, in stating the ground rules for dissolution, makes no declaration that the partnership \nassets will be utilized to pay partnership expenses before reversion to their original owners. This \ndeficiency militates against a finding in favor of partnership intent since it is assumed Chaiken would have \ninserted such provision had he thought his lesser partners would accept such liability. Partners do accept \nsuch liability, employees do not. \n \nMost importantly, co-owners carry on “a business for profit.” The phrase has been interpreted to mean \nthat partners share in the profits and the losses of the business. The intent to divide the profits is an \nindispensable requisite of partnership. Paragraph three of the agreement declares that each partner shall \nshare in the income of the business. There is no sharing of the profits, and as the agreement is drafted, \nthere are no profits. Merely sharing the gross returns does not establish a partnership. Nor is the sharing \nof profits prima facie evidence of a partnership where the profits received are in payment of wages. \n \nThe failure to share profits, therefore, is fatal to the partnership concept here. \n \nEvaluating Chaiken’s agreement in light of the elements implicit in a partnership, no partnership intent \ncan be found. The absence of the important right of decision making or the important duty to share \nliabilities upon dissolution individually may not be fatal to a partnership. But when both are absent,",

Later, well into discovery, Whitehead was made aware of the existence of the 52 Cattle Company \nwhen Shanahan stated in his deposition that he did not actually own any of the cattle on Whitehead’s \nranch. In his deposition, he described the partnership arrangement. At about the same time, Whitehead \nlearned that the name “52 Cattle Company” was not registered with the Elko County Clerk. \n \nWhitehead then filed a motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that, pursuant to NRS 602.070, \nLoomis and Shanahan’s failure to register their fictitiously named partnership with the county clerk \nbarred them from bringing a legal action. The district court agreed with Whitehead, granted the motion, \nand dismissed Loomis and Shanahan’s claims. Loomis and Shanahan timely appealed. \n \nDiscussion \nThe district court found that Loomis and Shanahan conducted business under a fictitious name without \nfiling a fictitious name certificate with the Elko County Clerk as required by NRS 602.010. [2] The district \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n478 \ncourt therefore concluded that, pursuant to NRS 602.070, they were barred from bringing an action \nagainst Whitehead because they did not file a fictitious name certificate for the 52 Cattle Company. [3] \n \nLoomis and Shanahan contend that the district court erred in granting partial summary judgment \nbecause they did not enter into a contract with Whitehead under the name of the 52 Cattle Company, and \nthey did not conduct business with Whitehead under that name. Loomis and Shanahan argue that NRS \n602.070 is not applicable to their action against Whitehead because they did not mislead Whitehead into \nthinking that he was doing business with anyone other than them. We agree.… \n \nWhen looking at a statute’s language, this court is bound to follow the statute’s plain meaning, unless the \nplain meaning was clearly not intended. Here, in using the phrase “under the assumed or fictitious name,” \nthe statute clearly bars bringing an action when the claims arise from a contract, transaction, or business \nconducted beneath the banner of an unregistered fictitious name. However, NRS 602.070 does not apply \nto individual partners whose transactions or business with another party were not performed under the \nfictitious name. \n \nHere, Whitehead knew that Shanahan entered into the oral contract under his own name. He initially \nthought that Shanahan owned the cattle and Loomis had “some type of interest.” Shanahan did not enter \ninto the contract under the fictitious “52 Cattle Company” name. Moreover, Whitehead does not allege \nthat he was misled by either Loomis or Shanahan in any way that would cause him to think he was doing \nbusiness with the 52 Cattle Company. In fact, Whitehead did not know of the 52 Cattle Company until \nShanahan mentioned it in his deposition. Under these circumstances, when there simply was no \nindication that Loomis and Shanahan represented that they were conducting business as the 52 Cattle \nCompany and no reliance by Whitehead that he was doing business with the 52 Cattle Company, NRS \n602.070 does not bar the suit against Whitehead. \n \nWe therefore reverse the district court’s partial summary judgment in this instance and remand for trial \nbecause, while the lawsuit between Loomis and Whitehead involved partnership business, the transaction \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n479 \nat issue was not conducted and the subsequent suit was not maintained under the aegis of the fictitiously \nnamed partnership. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. The purpose of the fictitious name statute might well be, as the court here describes it, “to prevent fraud \nand to give the public information about those entities with which they conduct business.” But that’s not \nwhat the statute says; it says nobody can sue on a cause of action arising out of business conducted under a \nfictitious name if the name is not registered. The legislature determined the consequence of failure to \nregister. Should the court disregard the statute’s plain, unambiguous meaning? \n2. That was one of two arguments by the dissent in this case. The second one was based on this problem: \nShanahan and Loomis agreed that the cattle at issue were partnership cattle bearing the “52” brand. That \nis, the cows were not Shanahan’s; they were the partnership’s. When Whitehead moved to dismiss \nShanahan’s claim—again, because the cows weren’t Shanahan’s—Shanahan conceded that but for the \nexistence of the partnership he would have no claim against Whitehead. If there is no claim against the \ndefendant except insofar as he harmed the partnership business (the cattle), how could the majority assert \nthat claims against Whitehead did not arise out of “the business” conducted under 52 Cattle Company?",

Thus it is \nheld that a partner \n• \nmay not compete with the partnership, \n• \nmay not make a secret profit while doing partnership business, \n• \nmust maintain the confidentiality of partnership information. \n \nThis is certainly not a comprehensive list, and courts will determine on a case-by-case basis whether the \nduty of loyalty has been breached. \n \nDuty of Care \nStemming from its roots in agency law, partnership law also imposes a duty of care on partners. Partners \nare to faithfully serve to the best of their ability. Section 404 of RUPA imposes the fiduciary standard on \nthe duty of care, but rather confusingly: how does the “punctilio of an honor the most sensitive”—as Judge \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n495 \nCardozo described that standard—apply when under RUPA Section 404(c) the “the duty of care…is \nlimited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a \nknowing violation of law”? Recognize that a person can attend to business both loyally and negligently. \nFor example, Alice Able, a partner in a law firm who is not very familiar with the firm’s computerized \nbookkeeping system, attempts to trace a missing check and in so doing erases a month’s worth of records. \nShe has not breached her duty of care: maybe she was negligent, but not grossly negligent under RUPA \nSection 404(c). The partnership agreement may reduce the duty of care so long as it is not “unreasonably \nreduce[d]”; it may increase the standard too. [6] \n \nDuty of Obedience \nThe partnership is a contractual relationship among the partners; they are all agents and principals of \neach other. Expressly or impliedly that means no partner can disobey the partnership agreement or fail to \nfollow any properly made partnership decision. This includes the duty to act within the authority \nexpressly or impliedly given in the partnership agreement, and a partner is responsible to the other \npartners for damages or losses arising from unauthorized activities. \n \nDuty to Inform Copartners \nAs in the agency relationship, a partner is expected to inform copartners of notices and matters coming to \nher attention that would be of interest to the partnership. \n \nDuty to Account \nThe partnership—and necessarily the partners—have a duty to allow copartners and their agents access to \nthe partnership’s books and records and to provide “any information concerning the partnership’s \nbusiness and affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the partner’s rights and duties under \nthe partnership agreement [or this Act].” [7] The fiduciary standard is imposed upon the duty to account \nfor “it any property, profit, or benefit derived by [a] partner,” as noted in RUPA Section 404. [8] \n \nThe Rights That Partners Have in a Partnership \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n496 \nNecessarily, for every duty owed there is a correlative right. So, for example, if a partner has a duty to \naccount, the other partners and the partnership have a right to an accounting. Beyond that, partners have \nrecognized rights affecting the operation of the partnership. \nHere we may call out the following salient rights: (1) to distributions of money, (2) to management, (3) to \nchoose copartners, (4) to property of the partnership, (5) to assign partnership interest, and (6) to enforce \nduties and rights. \n \nRights to Distributions \nThe purpose of a partnership is ultimately to distribute “money or other property from a partnership to a \npartner in the partner’s capacity.” [9] There are, however, various types of money distributions, including \nprofits (and losses), indemnification, capital, and compensation. \n \nRight to Profits (and Losses) \nProfits and losses may be shared according to any formula on which the partners agree. For example, the \npartnership agreement may provide that two senior partners are entitled to 35 percent each of the profit \nfrom the year and the two junior partners are entitled to 15 percent each. The next year the percentages \nwill be adjusted based on such things as number of new clients garnered, number of billable hours, or \namount of income generated. Eventually, the senior partners might retire and each be entitled to 2 \npercent of the firm’s income, and the previous junior partners become senior, with new junior partners \nadmitted. \n \nIf no provision is stated, then under RUPA Section 401(b), “each partner is entitled to an equal share of \nthe partnership profits and is chargeable with a share of the partnership losses in proportion to the \npartner’s share of the profits.” Section 18(a) of the Uniform Partnership Act is to the same effect. The right \nto share in the profits is the reason people want to “make partner”: a partner will reap the benefits of",

Describe the partners’ and partnership’s tax liability. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n505 \n \n \nBy express terms, the law of agency applies to partnership law. Every partner is an agent of the \npartnership for the purpose of its business. Consequently, the following discussion will be a review of \nagency law, covered in Chapter 11 \"Partnerships: General Characteristics and Formation\" as it applies to \npartnerships. The Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA) adds a few new wrinkles to the liability issue. \n \nContract Liability \nLiability of the Partnership \nRecall that an agent can make contracts on behalf of a principal under three types of authority: express, \nimplied, and apparent. Express authority is that explicitly delegated to the agent, implied authority is \nthat necessary to the carrying out of the express authority, and apparent authority is that which a third \nparty is led to believe has been conferred by the principal on the agent, even though in fact it was not or it \nwas revoked. When a partner has authority, the partnership is bound by contracts the partner makes on \nits behalf. Section 12.4.2 \"Partnership Authority, Express or Apparent\", Hodge v. Garrett, discusses all \nthree types of authority. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 305 of RUPA restates agency law: “A partnership is liable for loss or injury, or for a penalty \nincurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the \nordinary course” [1] of partnership business or with its authority. The ability of a partner to bind the \npartnership to contract liability is problematic, especially where the authority is apparent: the firm denies \nliability, lawsuits ensue, and unhappiness generally follows. \n \nBut the firm is not liable for an act not apparently in the ordinary course of business, unless the act was \nauthorized by the others. [2] Section 401(j) of RUPA requires the unanimous consent of the partners for a \ngrant of authority outside the ordinary course of business, unless the partnership agreement provides \notherwise. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n506 \nUnder the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) Section 9(3), the firm is not liable for five actions that no single \npartner has implied or apparent authority to do, because they are not “in the ordinary course of \npartnership.” These actions are: (1) assignment of partnership property for the benefit of creditors, (2) \ndisposing of the firm’s goodwill (selling the right to do business with the firm’s clients to another \nbusiness), (3) actions that make it impossible to carry on the business, (4) confessing a judgment against \nthe partnership, and (5) submitting a partnership claim or liability. RUPA omits that section, leaving it to \nthe courts to decide the outer limits of the agency power of a partner. In any event, unauthorized actions \nby a partner may be ratified by the partnership. \n \nPartnership “Statements” \nNew under RUPA is the ability of partnerships, partners, or even nonpartners to issue and file \n“statements” that announce to the world the establishment or denial of authority. The goal here is to \ncontrol the reach of apparent authority. There are several kinds of statements authorized. \n \nA statement of partnership authority is allowed by RUPA Section 303. It specifies the names of the \npartners authorized, or not authorized, to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership and any \nother matters. The most important goal of the statement of authority is to facilitate the transfer of real \nproperty held in the name of the partnership. A statement must specify the names of the partners \nauthorized to execute an instrument transferring that property. \nA statement of denial, RUPA Section 304, operates to allow partners (and persons named as partners) \nan opportunity to deny any fact asserted in a statement of partnership authority. \n \nA statement of dissociation, RUPA Section 704, may be filed by a partnership or a dissociated partner, \ninforming the world that the person is no longer a partner. This tells the world that the named person is \nno longer in the partnership. \n \nThere are three other statements authorized: a statement of qualification establishes that the partnership \nhas satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability \npartnership; a statement of foreign qualification means a limited liability partnership is qualified and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n507 \nregistered to do business in a state other than that in which it is originally registered; and a statement of \namendment or cancellation of any of the foregoing.

According to the comment, RUPA \ndramatically changes the law governing partnership breakups and dissolution. An entirely new concept, \n“dissociation,” is used in lieu of UPA term “dissolution” to denote the change in the relationship caused by \na partner’s ceasing to be associated in the carrying on of the business. “Dissolution” is retained but with a \ndifferent meaning. The entity theory of partnership provides a conceptual basis for continuing the firm \nitself despite a partner’s withdrawal from the firm. \n \nUnder UPA, the partnership is an aggregate, a collection of individuals; upon the withdrawal of any \nmember from the collection, the aggregate dissolves. But because RUPA conforms the partnership as an \nentity, there is no conceptual reason for it to dissolve upon a member’s withdrawal. “Dissociation” occurs \nwhen any partner ceases to be involved in the business of the firm, and “dissolution” happens when RUPA \nrequires the partnership to wind up and terminate; dissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution. \n \nDissociation \nDissociation, as noted in the previous paragraph, is the change in relations caused by a partner’s \nwithdrawal from the firm’s business. \n \nCauses of Dissociation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n517 \nDissociation is caused in ten possible ways: (1) a partner says she wants out; (2) an event triggers \ndissociation as per the partnership agreement; (3) a partner is expelled as per the agreement; (4) a \npartner is expelled by unanimous vote of the others because it is unlawful to carry on with that partner, \nbecause that partner has transferred to a transferee all interest in the partnership (except for security \npurposes), or because a corporate partner’s or partnership partner’s existence is effectively terminated; \n(5) by a court order upon request by the partnership or another partner because the one expelled has been \ndetermined to have misbehaved (engaged in serious wrongful conduct, persists in abusing the agreement, \nacts in ways making continuing the business impracticable); (6) the partner has declared bankruptcy; (7) \nthe partner has died or had a guardian appointed, or has been adjudicated as incompetent; (8) the partner \nis a trust whose assets are exhausted; (9) the partner is an estate and the estate’s interest in the \npartnership has been entirely transferred; (10) the partner dies or, if the partner is another partnership or \na corporation trust or estate, that entity’s existence is terminated. [11] \n \nEffect of Dissociation \nAfter a partner dissociates, the partner’s right to participate in management terminates. (However, if the \ndissociation goes on to dissolution and winding up, partners who have not wrongfully caused the \ndissociation may participate in winding-up activities.) [12] The dissociated partner’s duty of loyalty and \ncare terminates; the former partner may compete with the firm, except for matters arising before the \ndissociation. [13] \n \nWhen partners come and go, as they do, problems may arise. What power does the dissociated partner \nhave to bind the partnership? What power does the partnership have to impose liability on the dissociated \none? RUPA provides that the dissociated partner loses any actual authority upon dissociation, and his or \nher apparent authority lingers for not longer than two years if the dissociated one acts in a way that would \nhave bound the partnership before dissociation, provided the other party (1) reasonably believed the \ndissociated one was a partner, (2) did not have notice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have",

[16] For postdissociation liability, exposure is for two years if at the time of entering into the \ntransaction the other party (1) reasonably believed the dissociated one was a partner, (2) didn’t have \nnotice of the dissociation, and (3) is not deemed to have constructive notice from a filed “statement of \ndissociation.” For example, Baker withdraws from the firm of Able, Baker, and Carr. Able contracts with \nHydroLift for a new hydraulic car lift that costs $25,000 installed. HydroLift is not aware at the time of \ncontracting that Baker is disassociated and believes she is still a partner. A year later, the firm not having \nbeen paid, HydroLift sues Able, Baker, and Carr and the partnership. Baker has potential liability. Baker \ncould have protected herself by filing a “statement of dissociation,” or—better—the partnership agreement \nshould provide that the firm would file such statements upon the dissociation of any partner (and if it \ndoes not, it would be liable to her for the consequences). \n \nDissolution \nDissociation does not necessarily cause dissolution (see the discussion later in this section of how the firm \ncontinues after a dissociation); dissolution and winding up happen only for the causes stated in RUPA \nSection 801, discussed in the following paragraphs. \n \nCauses of Dissolution \nThere are three causes of dissolution: (1) by act of the partners—some dissociations do trigger dissolution; \n(2) by operation of law; or (3) by court order. The partnership agreement may change or eliminate the \ndissolution trigger as to (1); dissolution by the latter two means cannot be tinkered with.[17] \n \n(1) Dissolution by act of the partners may occur as follows: \n \n• \nAny member of an at-will partnership can dissociate at any time, triggering dissolution and \nliquidation. The partners who wish to continue the business of a term partnership, though, cannot \nbe forced to liquidate the business by a partner who withdraws prematurely in violation of the \npartnership agreement. In any event, common agreement formats for dissolution will provide for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n519 \nbuilt-in dispute resolution, and enlightened partners often agree to such mechanisms in advance to \navoid the kinds of problems listed here. \n• \nAny partnership will dissolve upon the happening of an event the partners specified would cause \ndissolution in their agreement. They may change their minds, of course, agree to continue, and amend \nthe partnership agreement accordingly. \n• \nA term partnership may be dissolved before its term expires in three ways. First, if a partner \ndissociated by death, declaring bankruptcy, becoming incapacitated, or wrongfully dissociates, the \npartnership will dissolve if within ninety days of that triggering dissociation at least half the \nremaining partners express their will to wind it up. Second, the partnership may be dissolved if the \nterm expires. Third, it may be dissolved if all the partners agree to amend the partnership agreement \nby expressly agreeing to dissolve. \n \n(2) Dissolution will happen in some cases by operation of law if it becomes illegal to continue the \nbusiness, or substantially all of it. For example, if the firm’s business was the manufacture and \ndistribution of trans fats and it became illegal to do that, the firm would dissolve. [18] This cause of \ndissolution is not subject to partnership agreement. \n \n(3) Dissolution by court order can occur on application by a partner. A court may declare that it is, for \nvarious reasons specified in RUPA Section 801(5), no longer reasonably practicable to continue operation. \nAlso, a court may order dissolution upon application by a transferee of a partner’s transferable interest or \nby a purchaser at a foreclosure of a charging order if the court determines it is equitable.

[25] \n \nSettlement of Accounts among Partners \nDetermining the priority of liabilities can be problematic. For instance, debts might be incurred to both \noutside creditors and partners, who might have lent money to pay off certain accounts or for working \ncapital. \n \nAn agreement can spell out the order in which liabilities are to be paid, but if it does not, UPA Section \n40(a) and RUPA Section 807(1) rank them in this order: (1) to creditors other than partners, (2) to \npartners for liabilities other than for capital and profits, (3) to partners for capital contributions, and \nfinally (4) to partners for their share of profits (see Figure 12.3 \"Priority Partnership Liabilities under \nRUPA\"). However, RUPA eliminates the distinction between capital and profits when the firm pays \npartners what is owed to them; RUPA Section 807(b) speaks simply of the right of a partner to a \nliquidating distribution. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.3 Priority Partnership Liabilities under RUPA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n522 \n \n \nPartners are entitled to share equally in the profits and surplus remaining after all liabilities, including \nthose owed to partners, are paid off, although the partnership agreement can state a different share—for \nexample, in proportion to capital contribution. If after winding up there is a net loss, whether capital or \notherwise, each partner must contribute toward it in accordance with his share in the profits, had there \nbeen any, unless the agreement states otherwise. If any of the partners is insolvent or refuses to contribute \nand cannot be sued, the others must contribute their own share to pay off the liabilities and in addition \nmust contribute, in proportion to their share of the profits, the additional amount necessary to pay the \nliabilities of their defaulting partners. \n \nIn the event of insolvency, a court may take possession of both partnership property and individual assets \nof the partners; this again is a big disadvantage to the partnership form. \n \nThe estate of a deceased partner is credited or liable as that partner would have been if she were living at \nthe time of the distribution. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder UPA, the withdrawal of any partner from the partnership causes dissolution; the withdrawal may be \ncaused in accordance with the agreement, in violation of the agreement, by operation of law, or by court \norder. Dissolution terminates the partners’ authority to act for the partnership, except for winding up, but \nremaining partners may decide to carry on as a new partnership or may decide to terminate the firm. If they \ncontinue, the old creditors remain as creditors of the new firm, the former partner remains liable for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n523 \nobligations incurred while she was a partner (she may be liable for debts arising after she left, unless proper \nnotice is given to creditors), and the former partner or her estate is entitled to an accounting and payment for \nthe partnership interest. If the partners move to terminate the firm, winding up begins. \nUnder RUPA, a partner who ceases to be involved in the business is dissociated, but dissociation does not \nnecessarily cause dissolution. Dissociation happens when a partner quits, voluntarily or involuntarily; when a \npartner dies or becomes incompetent; or on request by the firm or a partner upon court order for a partner’s \nwrongful conduct, among other reasons. The dissociated partner loses actual authority to bind the firm but \nremains liable for predissociation obligations and may have lingering authority or lingering liability for two \nyears provided the other party thought the dissociated one was still a partner; a notice of dissociation will, \nafter ninety days, be good against the world as to dissociation and dissolution. If the firm proceeds to \ntermination (though partners can stop the process before its end), the next step is dissolution, which occurs \nby acts of partners, by operation of law, or by court order upon application by a partner if continuing the \nbusiness has become untenable. After dissolution, the only business undertaken is to wind up affairs. \nHowever, the firm may continue after dissociation; it must buy out the dissociated one’s interest, minus \ndamages if the dissociation was wrongful. \nIf the firm is to be terminated, winding up entails finishing the business at hand, paying off creditors, and \nsplitting the remaining surplus or liabilities according the parties’ agreement or, absent any, according to the \nrelevant act (UPA or RUPA). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The division thereof after adjustments for plaintiff’s \npositive equity or capital resulted in an award to plaintiff for his interest in the business of $53,779.46 \n[about $126,000 in 2011 dollars].… \nPlaintiff also sought exemplary [punitive] damages. Count II of the complaint alleged that defendant’s \nconduct constituted a breach of defendant’s fiduciary duty to his partner under §§ 19-22 of the Uniform \nPartnership Act, and Count III alleged conversion of partnership property. Each count contained \nallegations that defendant’s conduct was willful, wanton and in reckless disregard of plaintiff’s rights and \nthat such conduct had caused injury to plaintiff’s feelings, including humiliation, indignity and a sense of \nmoral outrage. The prayer for relief sought exemplary damages therefore. \n \nPlaintiff’s testimony on the point was brief. He said: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n527 \nThe effect of really the whole situation, and I think it was most apparent when I walked into the \nempty building, was extreme disappointment and really total outrage at the fact that something \nthat I had given the utmost of my talent and creativity, energy, and whatever time was necessary \nto build, was totally destroyed and there was just nothing of any value that was left.…My \nbusiness had been stolen and there wasn’t a thing that I could do about it. And to me, that was \nvery humiliating that one day I had something that I had worked 10 years on, and the next day I \nhad absolutely nothing of any value. \n \nAs noted above, the trial judge found that defendant had literally destroyed the partnership by knowingly \nand willfully converting partnership assets in violation of his fiduciary duty as a partner. He also found \nthat plaintiff had suffered a sense of outrage, indignity and humiliation and awarded him $10,000 \n[$23,000 in 2011 dollars] as exemplary damages. \n \nDefendant appeals from that award, asserting that plaintiff’s cause of action arises from a breach of the \npartnership contract and that exemplary damages may not be awarded for breach of that contract.… \n \nIf it were to be assumed that a partner’s breach of his fiduciary duty or appropriation of partnership \nequipment and business contract to his own use and profit are torts, it is clear that the duty breached \narises from the partnership contract. One acquires the property interest of a co-tenant in partnership only \nby the contractual creation of a partnership; one becomes a fiduciary in partnership only by the \ncontractual undertaking to become a partner. There is no tortious conduct here existing independent of \nthe breach of the partnership contract. \n \nNeither do we see anything in the Uniform Partnership Act to suggest that an aggrieved partner is entitled \nto any remedy other than to be made whole economically. The act defines identically the partnership \nfiduciary duty and the remedy for its breach, i.e., to account: \n \nSec. 21.

Lopez is jointly and \nseverally liable to IKON for $9,000, which represents the amount Long paid IKON to defend and \nextinguish the partnership debt. We hold that Lopez is jointly and severally liable to Long for $1725, \nwhich represents the amount of attorney’s fees Long paid to defend against the IKON claim. We further \nhold that Long is entitled to recover from Lopez reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees in pursuing the \ninstant lawsuit. \n \nWe reverse the judgment of the trial court. We render judgment that Lopez owes Long $5362.50 (one-half \nof the partnership debt to IKON plus one-half of the corresponding attorney’s fees). We remand the case \nto the trial court for calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees owed by Lopez to Long in the instant \nlawsuit, and calculation of pre- and post-judgment interest. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. Why did the trial court determine that Lopez owed Long nothing? \n2. Absent a written partnership agreement, what rules control the operation and winding up of the \npartnership? \n3. Why did the appeals court determine that Long did have authority to settle the lawsuit with IKON? \n4. Lopez was not named by IKON when it sued Long and the partnership.

We reject its argument. \n \nSouthern Oaks argues Horizon wrongfully caused the dissolution because the basis for dissolution cited \nby the court is not one of the grounds for which the parties contracted. The pertinent contracts provided \nin section 7.3 “Causes of Dissolution”: “In addition to the causes for dissolution set forth in Section 7.2(c), \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n539 \nthe Partnership shall be dissolved in the event that:…(d) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the \nother Partner, either Partner elects to dissolve the Partnership on account of an Irreconcilable Difference \nwhich arises and cannot, after good faith efforts, be resolved.…” \n \nSouthern Oaks argues that what Horizon relied on at trial as showing irreconcilable differences—the \ndecisions of how profits were to be determined and divided—were not “good faith differences of opinion,” \nnor did they have “a material and adverse impact on the conduct of the Partnerships’ Business.” Horizon’s \nrefusal to pay Southern Oaks according to the terms of the contracts was not an “irreconcilable difference” \nas defined by the contract, Southern Oaks asserts, pointing out that Horizon’s acts were held to be \nbreaches of the contracts. Because there was no contract basis for dissolution, Horizon’s assertion of \ndissolution was wrongful, Southern Oaks concludes. \n \nSouthern Oaks contends further that not only were there no contractual grounds for dissolution, \ndissolution was also wrongful under the Florida Statutes. Southern Oaks argues that pursuant to section \n[of that statute] Horizon had the power to dissociate from the partnership, but, in the absence of contract \ngrounds for the dissociation, Horizon wrongfully dissociated. It asserts that it is entitled to lost future \nprofits under Florida’s partnership law.… \n \nWe find Southern Oaks’ argument without merit. First, the trial court’s finding that the parties are \nincapable of continuing to operate in business together is a finding of “irreconcilable differences,” a \npermissible reason for dissolving the partnerships under the express terms of the partnership agreements. \nThus, dissolution was not “wrongful,” assuming there can be “wrongful” dissolutions, and Southern Oaks \nwas not entitled to damages for lost future profits. Additionally, the partnership contracts also permit \ndissolution by “judicial decree.” Although neither party cites this provision, it appears that pursuant \nthereto, the parties agreed that dissolution would be proper if done by a trial court for whatever reason \nthe court found sufficient to warrant dissolution. \n \nSecond, even assuming the partnership was dissolved for a reason not provided for in the partnership \nagreements, damages were properly denied. Under RUPA, it is clear that wrongful dissociation triggers \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n540 \nliability for lost future profits. See [RUPA:] “A partner who wrongfully dissociates is liable to the \npartnership and to the other partners for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition \nto any other obligation of the partner to the partnership or to the other partners.” However, RUPA \ndoes not contain a similar provision for dissolution; RUPA does not refer to the dissolutions as rightful or \nwrongful. [RUPA sets out] “Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business,” [and] \noutlines the events causing dissolution without any provision for liability for damages.…[RUPA] \nrecognizes judicial dissolution: \n \nA partnership is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, only upon the occurrence of any of \nthe following events:… \n \n(5) On application by a partner, a judicial determination that: \n(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; \n(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business which makes it \nnot reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with such partner; or",

An assignment is usually made as security for a loan. The assignee \nbecomes a new limited partner only if all the others consent or if provided for in the certificate; the \nassignment does not cause dissolution. The happy ease with which a limited partner can divest himself of \nthe partnership interest makes the investment in the firm here more like that in a corporation than in a \ngeneral partnership. \n \n \n \n \nInspection of Books \nLimited partners have the right to inspect the firm’s books and records, they may own competing \ninterests, they may be creditors of the firm, and they may bring derivative suits on the firm’s behalf. They \nmay not withdraw their capital contribution if that would impair creditors’ rights. \n \nAddition of New Partners \nUnless the partnership agreement provides otherwise (it usually does), the admission of additional \nlimited partners requires the written consent of all. A general partner may withdraw at any time with \nwritten notice; if withdrawal is a violation of the agreement, the limited partnership has a right to claim of \ndamages. A limited partner can withdraw any time after six months’ notice to each general partner, and \nthe withdrawing partner is entitled to any distribution as per the agreement or, if none, to the fair value of \nthe interest based on the right to share in distributions. \n \nCompensation \nWe noted in discussing partnerships that the partners are not entitled to “compensation,” that is, payment \nfor their work; they are entitled to a share of the profits. For limited partnerships, the rule is a bit \ndifferent. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n553 \nGeneral Partners \nOften, general partners are paid for their management work on a sliding scale, receiving a greater share of \neach dollar of cash flow as the limited partners’ cash distributions rise, thus giving the general partner an \nincentive to increase limited-partner distributions. \n \nLimited Partners \nProfits or losses are shared as agreed in the certificate or, if there is no agreement, in accordance with the \npercentages of capital contributions made. \n \nLiabilities \nLiability is not shared. \nGeneral Partners \nThe general partners are liable as in a general partnership, and they have the same fiduciary duty and \nduty of care as partners in a general partnership. However, see the discussion in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited \nLiability Limited Partnerships\" of the newest type of LP, the limited liability limited partnership (triple \nLP), where the general partner is also afforded limited liability under ULPA-2001. \n \nLimited Partners \nThe limited partners are only liable up to the amount of their capital contribution, provided the surname \nof the limited partner does not appear in the partnership name (unless his name is coincidentally the \nsame as that of one of the general partners whose name does appear) and provided the limited partner \ndoes not participate in control of the firm. See Section 13.4.1 \"Limited Partnerships: Limited Partners’ \nLiability for Managing Limited Partnership\" for a case that highlights liability issues for partners. \n \nWe have been discussing ULPA-1985 here. But in a world of limited liability companies, limited liability \npartnerships, and limited liability limited partnerships, “the control rule has become an anachronism”; \nULPA-2001 “provides a full, status-based liability shield for each limited partner, ‘even if the limited \npartner participates in the management and control of the limited partnership.’ [3] The section thus \neliminates the so-called control rule with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n554 \nlimited partners into parity with LLC members, LLP partners and corporate shareholders.” [4]And as will \nbe noted in Section 13.3.3 \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships\" under ULPA-2001 the general partner \nis also shielded from liability. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the limited partnership meets a minimum number of criteria related to limited liability, \ncentralized management, duration, and transferability of ownership, it can enjoy the benefits of pass-\nthrough taxation; otherwise it will be taxed as a corporation. Pass-through (“conduit”) taxation is usually \nvery important to partners. \nTermination \nThe limited partnership’s termination involves the same three steps as in a general partnership: (1) \ndissolution, (2) winding up, and (3) termination. \n \nDissolution \nDissolution of a limited partnership is the first step toward termination (but termination does not \nnecessarily follow dissolution). The limited partners have no power to dissolve the firm except on court \norder, and the death or bankruptcy of a limited partner does not dissolve the firm. The following events \nmay cause dissolution: (1) termination of the partnership as per the certificate’s provisions; (2)",

Contributions may be in the form of cash, property or services rendered, or a promise \nto render them in the future. \n \nControl and Compensation \nControl \nThe LLC operating agreement may provide for either a member-managed LLC or a manager-managed \n(centralized) LLC. If the former, all members have actual and apparent authority to bind the LLC to \ncontracts on its behalf, as in a partnership, and all members’ votes have equal weight unless otherwise \nagreed. Member-managers have duty of care and a fiduciary duty, though the parameters of those duties \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n559 \nvary from state to state. If the firm is manager managed, only managers have authority to bind the firm; \nthe managers have the duty of care and fiduciary duty, but the nonmanager members usually do not. \nSome states’ statutes provide that voting is based on the financial interests of the members. Most statutes \nprovide that any extraordinary firm decisions be voted on by all members (e.g., amend the agreement, \nadmit new members, sell all the assets prior to dissolution, merge with another entity). Members can \nmake their own rules without the structural requirements (e.g., voting rights, notice, quorum, approval of \nmajor decisions) imposed under state corporate law. \n \nIf the firm has a centralized manager system, it gets a check in its “corporate-like” box, so it will need to \nmake sure there are enough noncorporate-like attributes to make up for this one. If it looks too much like \na corporation, it will be taxed like one. \n \nOne of the real benefits of the LLC as compared with the corporation is that no annual meetings are \nrequired, and no minutes need to be kept. Often, owners of small corporations ignore these formalities to \ntheir peril, but with the LLC there are no worries about such record keeping. \n \nCompensation \nDistributions are allocated among members of an LLC according to the operating agreement; managing \npartners may be paid for their services. Absent an agreement, distributions are allocated among members \nin proportion to the values of contributions made by them or required to be made by them. Upon a \nmember’s dissociation that does not cause dissolution, a dissociating member has the right to distribution \nas provided in the agreement, or—if no agreement—the right to receive the fair value of the member’s \ninterest within a reasonable time after dissociation. No distributions are allowed if making them would \ncause the LLC to become insolvent. \n \nLiability \nThe great accomplishment of the LLC is, again, to achieve limited liability for all its members: no general \npartner hangs out with liability exposure. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n560 \nLiability to Outsiders \nMembers are not liable to third parties for contracts made by the firm or for torts committed in the scope \nof business (but of course a person is always liable for her own torts), regardless of the owner’s level of \nparticipation—unlike a limited partnership, where the general partner is liable. Third parties’ only \nrecourse is as against the firm’s property. See Puleo v. Topel, (see Section 13.4.2 \"Liability Issues in \nLLCs\"), for an analysis of owner liability in an LLC. \n \nInternal Liabilities \nUnless the operating agreement provides otherwise, members and managers of the LLC are generally not \nliable to the firm or its members except for acts or omissions constituting gross negligence, intentional \nmisconduct, or knowing violations of the law. Members and managers, though, must account to the firm \nfor any personal profit or benefit derived from activities not consented to by a majority of disinterested \nmembers or managers from the conduct of the firm’s business or member’s or managers use of firm \nproperty—which is the same as in partnership law. \n \nTaxation \nAssuming the LLC is properly formed so that it is not too much like a corporation, it will—upon its \nmembers’ election—be treated like a partnership for tax purposes. \n \nTermination \nTermination, loosely speaking, refers either to how the entity’s life as a business ends (continuity of life) \nor to how a member’s interest in the firm ends—that is, how freely the interest is transferable. \n \nContinuity of Life \nThe first step in the termination of the LLC is dissolution, though dissolution is not necessarily followed \nby termination. \n \nDissolution and Winding Up \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n561 \nThe IRS has determined that continuity of life does not exist “if the death, insanity, bankruptcy, \nretirement, resignation, or expulsion of any member will cause a dissolution of the organization,” [1] and \nthat if one of these events occurs, the entity may continue only with the members’ unanimous consent.",

And by this means the firm does not have continuity of life. Some states provide \nopportunities for even more flexibility regarding the “unanimous” part. In the mid-1990s, the IRS issued \nrevenue rulings (as opposed to regulations) that it would be enough if a “majority in interest” of \nremaining partners agreed to continue the business, and the “flexible” statute states adopted this \npossibility (the ones that did not are called “bulletproof” statutes). “Majority in interests” means a \nmajority of profits and capital. \n \nIf the firm does dissolve, some states require public filings to that effect. If dissolution leads to winding \nup, things progress as in a general partnership: the business at hand is finished, accounts are rendered, \nbills paid, assets liquidated, and remaining assets are distributed to creditors (including member and \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n562 \nmanager creditors, but not for their shares in profits); to members and past members for unpaid \ndistributions; to members for capital contributions; and to members as agreed or in proportion to \ncontributions made. Upon dissolution, actual authority of members or managers terminates except as \nneeded to wind up; members may have apparent authority, though, unless the third party had notice of \nthe dissolution. \n \nFree Transferability of Interest \nAgain, the problem here is that if a member’s interest in the LLC is as freely transferable as a \nshareholder’s interest in a corporation (an owner can transfer all attributes of his interest without the \nothers’ consent), the LLC will probably be said to have a check mark in the “corporate-like” box: too many \nof those and the firm will not be allowed pass-through taxation. Thus the trick for the LLC promoters is to \nlimit free transferability enough to pass the test of not being a corporation, but not limit so much as to \nmake it really difficult to divest oneself of the interest (then it’s not a very liquid or desirable investment). \n \nSome states’ LLC statutes have as the default rule that the remaining members must unanimously consent \nto allow an assignee or a transferee of a membership interest to participate in managing the LLC. Since \nthis prevents a member from transferring all attributes of the interest (the right to participate in \nmanagement isn’t transferred or assigned), the LLC formed under the default provision will not have “free \ntransferability of interest.” But if the LLC agreement allows majority consent for the transfer of all \nattributes, that also would satisfy the requirement that there not be free transferability of interests. Then \nwe get into the question of how to define “majority”: by number of members or by value of their \nmembership? And what if only the managing partners need to consent? Or if there are two classes of \nmembership and the transfer of interests in one class requires the consent of the other? The point is that \npeople keep pushing the boundaries to see how close their LLC can come to corporation-like status \nwithout being called a corporation.",

[2] (Here we see an example of the legislature allowing \nbusiness owners to externalize the risks of business operation.) More broadly, the success of the limited \nliability company attracted the attention of professionals like accountants, lawyers, and doctors who \nsought insulation from personal liability for the mistakes or malpractice of their partners. Their wish was \ngranted with the adoption in all states of statutes authorizing the creation of the limited liability \npartnership in the early 1990s. Most partnership law under the Revised Uniform Partnership Act applies \nto LLPs. \n \nCreation \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n566 \nMembers of a partnership (only a majority is required) who want to form an LLP must file with the \nsecretary of state; the name of the firm must include “limited liability partnership” or “LLP” to notify the \npublic that its members will not stand personally for the firm’s liabilities. \n \nLiability \nAs noted, the purpose of the LLP form of business is to afford insulation from liability for its members. A \ntypical statute provides as follows: “Any obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a \nlimited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the \npartnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of indemnification, \ncontribution, assessment or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a \npartner.” [3] \n \nHowever, the statutes vary. The early ones only allowed limited liability for negligent acts and retained \nunlimited liability for other acts, such as malpractice, misconduct, or wrongful acts by partners, \nemployees, or agents. The second wave eliminated all these as grounds for unlimited liability, leaving only \nbreaches of ordinary contract obligation. These two types of legislation are called partial shield statutes. \nThe third wave of LLP legislation offered full shield protection—no unlimited liability at all. Needless to \nsay, the full-shield type has been most popular and most widely adopted. Still, however, many statutes \nrequire specified amounts of professional malpractice insurance, and partners remain fully liable for their \nown negligence or for wrongful acts of those in the LLP whom they supervise. \n \nIn other respects, the LLP is like a partnership. \n \n \nLimited Liability Limited Partnerships \nThe progress toward achieving limited liability continues. A \nlimited liability limited partnership (LLLP, or triple LP) is the latest invention. It is a limited \npartnership that has invoked the LLLP provisions of its state partnership law by filing with a specified \npublic official the appropriate documentation to become an LLLP. This form completely eliminates the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n567 \nautomatic personal liability of the general partner for partnership obligations and, under most statutes, \nalso eliminates the “control rule” liability exposure for all limited partners. It is noteworthy that California \nlaw does not allow for an LLLP to be formed in California; however, it does recognize LLLPs formed in \nother states. A “foreign” LLLP doing business in California must register with the secretary of state. As of \nFebruary 2011, twenty-one states allow the formation of LLLPs. \n \nThe 2001 revision of the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) provides this definition of an LLLP: \n“‘Limited liability limited partnership’…means a limited partnership whose certificate of limited \npartnership states that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.” [4] Section 404(c) \ngets to the point: “An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a \nlimited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation \nof the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of \ncontribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. \nThis subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed \nimmediately before the consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership[.]” [5]",

If so was the court’s decision was correct? The current LLC \nact language is similar to the Model Business Corporation Act, which surely permits piercing (see Chapter \n14 \"Corporation: General Characteristics and Formation\"). \n \n \nDefective Registration as a Limited Liability Partnership \nCampbell v.

Super. 2007) \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n577 \nThis case concerns the aftermath of the dissolution of the parties’ law practice. Following a hearing on \nJanuary 2 and 3, 2007, this court issued a memorandum of decision on January 5, 2007 granting the \nplaintiff a prejudgment remedy in the amount of $15,782.01. The plaintiff has now moved for reargument, \ncontending that the court improperly considered as a setoff one-half of a malpractice settlement paid \npersonally by the defendant, which sum the court found to be a debt of a partnership. [The defendant was \nsued for malpractice by a third party; he paid the entire claim personally and when the law firm dissolved, \nthe plaintiff’s share from the liquidated assets was reduced by one-half to account for the amount the \ndefendant had paid.] \n \nIn support of his motion to reargue, the plaintiff relies on General Statutes Sec. 34-427(c) and, in that \nmotion, italicizes those portions which he believes apply to his request for reargument. That section states \n(with emphasis as supplied in the plaintiff’s motion) that: \n \na partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable directly or indirectly, including \nby way of indemnification, contribution or otherwise, for any debts, obligations and liabilities of \nor chargeable to the partnership or another partner or partners, whether arising in \ncontract, tort, or otherwise, arising in the course of the partnership business while the \npartnership is a registered limited liability partnership. (emphasis in original) \n \nWhile italicizing the phases that appear to suit his purposes, the plaintiff completely ignores the most \nimportant phrase: “a partner in a registered limited liability partnership.” At the hearing, neither party \npresented any evidence at the hearing that tended to prove that the nature of the business relationship \nbetween the parties was that of a “registered limited liability partnership.” To the contrary, the testimony \npresented at the hearing revealed that the parties had a general partnership in which they had orally",

By the seventeenth century, with feudalism on the \nwane and business enterprise becoming a growing force, kings extracted higher taxes and intervened \nmore directly in the affairs of businesses by refusing to permit them to operate in corporate form except \nby royal grant. This came to be known as the concession theory, because incorporation was a \nconcession from the sovereign. \n \nThe most important concessions, or charters, were those given to the giant foreign trading companies, \nincluding the Russia Company (1554), the British East India Company (1600), Hudson’s Bay Company \n(1670, and still operating in Canada under the name “the Bay”), and the South Sea Company (1711). These \nwere joint-stock companies—that is, individuals contributed capital to the enterprise, which traded on \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n587 \nbehalf of all the stockholders. Originally, trading companies were formed for single voyages, but the \nadvantages of a continuing fund of capital soon became apparent. Also apparent was the legal \ncharacteristic that above all led shareholders to subscribe to the stock: limited liability. They risked only \nthe cash they put in, not their personal fortunes. \n \nSome companies were wildly successful. The British East India Company paid its original investors a \nfourfold return between 1683 and 1692. But perhaps nothing excited the imagination of the British more \nthan the discovery of gold bullion aboard a Spanish shipwreck; 150 companies were quickly formed to \nsalvage the sunken Spanish treasure. Though most of these companies were outright frauds, they ignited \nthe search for easy wealth by a public unwary of the risks. In particular, the South Sea Company promised \nthe sun and the moon: in return for a monopoly over the slave trade to the West Indies, it told an \nenthusiastic public that it would retire the public debt and make every person rich. \n \nIn 1720, a fervor gripped London that sent stock prices soaring. Beggars and earls alike speculated from \nJanuary to August; and then the bubble burst. Without considering the ramifications, Parliament had \nenacted the highly restrictive Bubble Act, which was supposed to do away with unchartered joint-\nstock companies. When the government prosecuted four companies under the act for having fraudulently \nobtained charters, the public panicked and stock prices came tumbling down, resulting in history’s first \nmodern financial crisis. \n \nAs a consequence, corporate development was severely retarded in England. Distrustful of the chartered \ncompany, Parliament issued few corporate charters, and then only for public or quasi-public \nundertakings, such as transportation, insurance, and banking enterprises. Corporation law languished: \nWilliam Blackstone devoted less than 1 percent of his immensely influential Commentaries on the Law of \nEngland (1765) to corporations and omitted altogether any discussion of limited liability. In The Wealth \nof Nations (1776), Adam Smith doubted that the use of corporations would spread. England did not repeal \nthe Bubble Act until 1825, and then only because the value of true incorporation had become apparent \nfrom the experience of its former colonies. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n588 \nUS Corporation Formation \nThe United States remained largely unaffected by the Bubble Act. Incorporation was granted only by \nspecial acts of state legislatures, even well into the nineteenth century, but many such acts were passed. \nBefore the Revolution, perhaps fewer than a dozen business corporations existed throughout the thirteen \ncolonies. During the 1790s, two hundred businesses were incorporated, and their numbers swelled \nthereafter. The theory that incorporation should not be accomplished except through special legislation \nbegan to give way. As industrial development accelerated in the mid-1800s, it was possible in many states \nto incorporate by adhering to the requirements of a general statute. Indeed, by the late nineteenth \ncentury, all but three states constitutionally forbade their legislatures from chartering companies through \nspecial enactments. \n \nThe US Supreme Court contributed importantly to the development of corporate law. In Gibbons v. \nOgden, [1] a groundbreaking case, the Court held that the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution (Article \nI, Section 8, Clause 3) granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. However, in Paul v. \nVirginia, [2] the Court said that a state could prevent corporations not chartered there—that is, out-of-\nstate or foreign corporations—from engaging in what it considered the local, and not interstate, \nbusiness of issuing insurance policies. The inference made by many was that states could not bar foreign \ncorporations engaged in interstate business from their borders. \n \nThis decision brought about a competition in corporation laws.

These restrictions and limitations were \nthought to be necessary to protect the citizenry of the chartering legislature’s own state. But once it \nbecame clear that companies chartered in one state could operate in others, states began in effect to “sell” \nincorporation for tax revenues. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n589 \nNew Jersey led the way in 1875 with a general incorporation statute that greatly liberalized the powers of \nmanagement and lifted many of the former restrictions. The Garden State was ultimately eclipsed by \nDelaware, which in 1899 enacted the most liberal corporation statute in the country, so that to the present \nday there are thousands of “Delaware corporations” that maintain no presence in the state other than an \naddress on file with the secretary of state in Dover. \n \nDuring the 1920s, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted a Uniform \nBusiness Corporation Act, the final version of which was released in 1928. It was not widely adopted, but \nit did provide the basis during the 1930s for revisions of some state laws, including those in California, \nIllinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania. By that time, in the midst of the Great Depression, the \nfederal government for the first time intruded into corporate law in a major way by creating federal \nagencies, most notably the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, with power to regulate the \ninterstate issuance of corporate stock. \n \nCorporate Law Today \nFollowing World War II, most states revised their general corporation laws. A significant development for \nstates was the preparation of the Model Business Corporation Act by the American Bar Association’s \nCommittee on Corporate Laws. About half of the states have adopted all or major portions of the act. The \n2005 version of this act, the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), will be referred to \nthroughout our discussion of corporation law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations have their roots in political and religious authority. The concept of limited liability and visions of \nfinancial rewards fueled the popularity of joint-stock companies, particularly trading companies, in late-\nseventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England. The English Parliament successfully enacted the Bubble \nAct in 1720 to curb the formation of these companies; the restrictions weren’t loosened until over one \nhundred years later, after England viewed the success of corporations in its former colonies. Although early \ncorporate laws in the United States were fairly restrictive, once states began to “sell” incorporation for tax \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n590 \nrevenues, the popularity of liberal and corporate-friendly laws caught on, especially in Delaware beginning in \n1899. A corporation remains a creature of the state—that is, the state in which it is incorporated. Delaware \nremains the state of choice because more corporations are registered there than in any other state. \n \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Know what rights a corporate “person” and a natural person have in common. \n2. Recognize when a corporate “veil” is pierced and shareholder liability is imposed. \n3. Identify other instances when a shareholder will be held personally liable. \n \nIn comparing partnerships and corporations, there is one additional factor that ordinarily tips the balance \nin favor of incorporating: the corporation is a legal entity in its own right, one that can provide a “veil” \nthat protects its shareholders from personal liability. \n \nFigure 14.1 The Corporate Veil \n \n \nThis crucial factor accounts for the development of much of corporate law. Unlike the individual actor in \nthe legal system, the corporation is difficult to deal with in conventional legal terms. The business of the \nsole proprietor and the sole proprietor herself are one and the same. When a sole proprietor makes a \ndecision, she risks her own capital. When the managers of a corporation take a corporate action, they are \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n594 \nrisking the capital of others—the shareholders. Thus accountability is a major theme in the system of law \nconstructed to cope with legal entities other than natural persons. \n \n \n \nThe Basic Rights of the Corporate “Person” \nTo say that a corporation is a “person” does not automatically describe what its rights are, for the \ncourts have not accorded the corporation every right guaranteed a natural person. Yet the Supreme Court \nrecently affirmed in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010) that the government may not \nsuppress the First Amendment right of political speech because the speaker is a corporation rather than a \nnatural person. According to the Court, “No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the \npolitical speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” [1] \n \nThe courts have also concluded that corporations are entitled to the essential constitutional protections of \ndue process and equal protection. They are also entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against \nunreasonable search and seizure; in other words, the police must have a search warrant to enter corporate \npremises and look through files. Warrants, however, are not required for highly regulated industries, such \nas those involving liquor or guns. The Double Jeopardy Clause applies to criminal prosecutions of \ncorporations: an acquittal cannot be appealed nor can the case be retried. For purposes of the federal \ncourts’ diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is deemed to be a citizen of both the state in which it is \nincorporated and the state in which it has its principal place of business (often, the corporate \n“headquarters”). \n \nUntil relatively recently, few cases had tested the power of the state to limit the right of corporations to \nspend their own funds to speak the “corporate mind.” Most cases involving corporate free speech address \nadvertising, and few states have enacted laws that directly impinge on the freedom of companies to \nadvertise. But those states that have done so have usually sought to limit the ability of corporations to \nsway voters in public referenda. In 1978, the Supreme Court finally confronted the issue head on in First \nNational Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (Section 14.7.1 \"Limiting a Corporation’s First Amendment Rights\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n595 \nThe ruling in Bellotti was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. In Citizens United, the Court struck down the part of the McCain-Feingold Act [2] that \nprohibited all corporations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, and unions from broadcasting \n“electioneering communications.” \nAbsence of Rights \nCorporations lack certain rights that natural persons possess. For example, corporations do not have the \nprivilege against self-incrimination guaranteed for natural persons by the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments. In any legal proceeding, the courts may force a corporation to turn over incriminating \ndocuments, even if they also incriminate officers or employees of the corporation. As we explore \nin Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign Corporations, and \nCorporate Dissolution\", corporations are not citizens under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the \nConstitution, so that the states can discriminate between domestic and foreign corporations. And the \ncorporation is not entitled to federal review of state criminal convictions, as are many individuals. \n \nPiercing the Corporate Veil \nGiven the importance of the corporate entity as a veil that limits shareholder liability, it is important to",

            "chunk": "associations, and the like, but virtually all business corporations are chartered at the state level. \n \nOriginally a legislative function, chartering is now an administrative function in every state. The secretary \nof state issues the final indorsement to the articles of incorporation, thus giving them legal effect. \n \nCharter as a Contract \nThe charter is a contract between the state and the corporation. Under the Contracts Clause of Article I of \nthe Constitution, no state can pass any law “impairing the obligation of contracts.” In 1816, the question \narose whether a state could revoke or amend a corporate charter once granted. The corporation in \nquestion was Dartmouth College. The New Hampshire legislature sought to turn the venerable private \ncollege, operating under an old royal charter, into a public institution by changing the membership of its \nboard. The case wound up in the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that the legislature’s \nattempt was unconstitutional, because to amend a charter is to impair a contract. [1] \nThis decision pleased incorporators because it implied that once a corporation had been created, the state \ncould never modify the powers it had been granted. But, in addition, the ruling seemed to favor \nmonopolies. The theory was that by granting a charter to, say, a railroad corporation, the state was barred \nfrom creating any further railroad corporations. Why? Because, the lawyers argued, a competitor would \ncut into the first company’s business, reducing the value of the charter, hence impairing the contract. \nJustice Joseph Story, concurring in the Dartmouth case, had already suggested the way out for the states: \n“If the legislature mean to claim such an authority [to alter or amend the charter], it must be reserved in \nthe grant. The charter of Dartmouth College contains no such reservation.…” The states quickly picked up \non Justice Story’s suggestion and wrote into the charter explicit language giving legislatures the authority \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n603 \nto modify corporations’ charters at their pleasure. So the potential immutability of corporate charters had \nlittle practical chance to develop. \n \nSelection of a State \nWhere to Charter \nChoosing the particular venue in which to incorporate is the first critical decision to be made after \ndeciding to incorporate. Some corporations, though headquartered in the United States, choose to \nincorporate offshore to take advantage of lenient taxation laws. Advantages of an offshore corporation \ninclude not only lenient tax laws but also a great deal of privacy as well as certain legal protections. For \nexample, the names of the officers and directors can be excluded from documents filed. In the United \nStates, over half of theFortune 500 companies hold Delaware charters for reasons related to Delaware’s \nhaving a lower tax structure, a favorable business climate, and a legal system—both its statutes and its \ncourts—seen as being up to date, flexible, and often probusiness. Delaware’s success has led other states to \ncompete, and the political realities have caused the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA), \nwhich was intentionally drafted to balance the interests of all significant groups (management, \nshareholders, and the public), to be revised from time to time so that it is more permissive from the \nperspective of management. \n \nWhy Choose Delaware? \nDelaware remains the most popular state in which to incorporate for several reasons, including the \nfollowing: (1) low incorporation fees; (2) only one person is needed to serve the incorporator of the \ncorporation; the RMBC requires three incorporators; (3) no minimum capital requirement; (4) favorable \ntax climate, including no sales tax; (5) no taxation of shares held by nonresidents; and (5) no corporate \nincome tax for companies doing business outside of Delaware. In addition, Delaware’s Court of Chancery, \na court of equity, is renowned as a premier business court with a well-established body of corporate law, \nthereby affording a business a certain degree of predictability in judicial decision making. \n \nThe Promoter \nFunctions \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n604 \nOnce the state of incorporation has been selected, it is time for promoters, the midwives of the \nenterprise, to go to work.

They have four principal \nfunctions: (1) to seek out or discover business opportunities, (2) to raise capital by persuading investors to \nsign stock subscriptions, (3) to enter into contracts on behalf of the corporation to be formed, (4) and to \nprepare the articles of incorporation. \n \nPromoters have acquired an unsavory reputation as fast talkers who cajole investors out of their money. \nThough some promoters fit this image, it is vastly overstated.

Promotion is difficult work often carried out \nby the same individuals who will manage the business. \n \nContract Liability \nPromoters face two major legal problems. First, they face possible liability on contracts made on behalf of \nthe business before it is incorporated. For example, suppose Bob is acting as promoter of the proposed \nBCT Bookstore, Inc. On September 15, he enters into a contract with Computogram Products to purchase \ncomputer equipment for the corporation to be formed. If the incorporation never takes place, or if the \ncorporation is formed but the corporation refuses to accept the contract, Bob remains liable. \n \nNow assume that the corporation is formed on October 15, and on October 18 it formally accepts all the \ncontracts that Bob signed prior to October 15. Does Bob remain liable? In most states, he does. The \nratification theory of agency law will not help in many states that adhere strictly to agency rules, because \nthere was no principal (the corporation) in existence when the contract was made and hence the promoter \nmust remain liable. To avoid this result, Bob should seek an express novation, although in some states, a \nnovation will be implied. The intention of the parties should be stated as precisely as possible in the \ncontract, as the promoters learned in RKO-Stanley Warner Theatres, Inc. v. Graziano, (see Section 14.7.3 \n\"Corporate Promoter\"). \n \nThe promoters’ other major legal concern is the duty owed to the corporation. The law is clear that \npromoters owe a fiduciary duty. For example, a promoter who transfers real estate worth $250,000 to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n605 \ncorporation in exchange for $750,000 worth of stock would be liable for $500,000 for breach of fiduciary \nduty. \n \nPreincorporation Stock Subscriptions \nOne of the promoter’s jobs is to obtain preincorporation stock subscriptions to line up offers by \nwould-be investors to purchase stock in the corporation to be formed. These stock subscriptions are \nagreements to purchase, at a specified price, a certain number of shares of stock of a corporation, which is \nto be formed at some point in the future. The contract, however, actually comes into \nexistence after formation, once the corporation itself accepts the offer to subscribe. Alice agrees with Bob \nto invest $10,000 in the BCT Bookstore, Inc. for one thousand shares. The agreement is treated as an offer \nto purchase. The offer is deemed accepted at the moment the bookstore is incorporated. \n \nThe major problem for the corporation is an attempt by subscribers to revoke their offers. A basic rule of \ncontract law is that offers are revocable before acceptance. Under RMBCA, Section 6.20, however, a \nsubscription for shares is irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement itself provides \notherwise or unless all the subscribers consent to revocation. In many states that have not adopted the \nmodel act, the contract rule applies and the offer is always revocable. Other states use various common-\nlaw devices to prevent revocation. For example, the subscription by one investor is held as consideration \nfor the subscription of another, so that a binding contract has been formed. \n \nExecution and Filing of the Articles of Incorporation \nOnce the business details are settled, the promoters, now known as incorporators, must sign and deliver \nthe articles of incorporation to the secretary of state. The articles of incorporation typically include the \nfollowing: the corporate name; the address of the corporation’s initial registered office; the period of the \ncorporation’s duration (usually perpetual); the company’s purposes; the total number of shares, the \nclasses into which they are divided, and the par value of each; the limitations and rights of each class of \nshareholders; the authority of the directors to establish preferred or special classes of stock; provisions for \npreemptive rights; provisions for the regulation of the internal affairs of the corporation, including any \nprovision restricting the transfer of shares; the number of directors constituting the initial board of \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n606 \ndirectors and the names and addresses of initial members; and the name and address of each \nincorporator.

Although compliance with these requirements is largely a matter of filling in the blanks, two \npoints deserve mention. \n \nFirst, the choice of a name is often critical to the business. Under RMBCA, Section 4.01, the name must \ninclude one of the following words (or abbreviations): corporation, company, incorporated, or limited \n(Corp., Co., Inc., or Ltd.). The name is not allowed to deceive the public about the corporation’s purposes, \nnor may it be the same as that of any other company incorporated or authorized to do business in the \nstate. \n \nThese legal requirements are obvious; the business requirements are much harder. If the name is not \ndescriptive of the business or does not anticipate changes in the business, it may have to be changed, and \nthe change can be expensive. For example, when Standard Oil Company of New Jersey changed its name \nto Exxon in 1972, the estimated cost was over $100 million. (And even with this expenditure, some \nshareholders grumbled that the new name sounded like a laxative.) \n \nThe second point to bear in mind about the articles of incorporation is that drafting the clause stating \ncorporate purposes requires special care, because the corporation will be limited to the purposes set forth. \nIn one famous case, the charter of Cornell University placed a limit on the amount of contributions it \ncould receive from any one benefactor. When Jennie McGraw died in 1881, leaving to Cornell the carillon \nthat still plays on the Ithaca, New York, campus to this day, she also bequeathed to the university her \nresiduary estate valued at more than $1 million. This sum was greater than the ceiling placed in Cornell’s \ncharter. After lengthy litigation, the university lost in the US Supreme Court, and the money went to her \nfamily. [2] The dilemma is how to draft a clause general enough to allow the corporation to expand, yet \nspecific enough to prevent it from engaging in undesirable activities. \n \nSome states require the purpose clauses to be specific, but the usual approach is to permit a broad \nstatement of purposes. Section 3.01 of the RMBCA goes one step further in providing that a corporation \nautomatically “has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business” unless the articles specify a more \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n607 \nlimited purpose. Once completed, the articles of incorporation are delivered to the secretary of state for \nfiling. The existence of a corporation begins once the articles have been filed. \n \nOrganizational Meeting of Directors \nThe first order of business, once the certificate of incorporation is issued, is a meeting of the board of \ndirectors named in the articles of incorporation. They must adopt bylaws, elect officers, and transact any \nother business that may come before the meeting (RMBCA, Section 2.05). Other business would include \naccepting (ratifying) promoters’ contracts, calling for the payment of stock subscriptions, and adopting \nbank resolution forms, giving authority to various officers to sign checks drawn on the corporation. \nSection 10.20 of the RMBCA vests in the directors the power to alter, amend, or repeal the bylaws adopted \nat the initial meeting, subject to repeal or change by the shareholders. The articles of incorporation may \nreserve the power to modify or repeal exclusively to the shareholders. The bylaws may contain any \nprovisions that do not conflict with the articles of incorporation or the law of the state. \n \nTypical provisions in the bylaws include fixing the place and time at which annual stockholders’ meetings \nwill be held, fixing a quorum, setting the method of voting, establishing the method of choosing directors, \ncreating committees of directors, setting down the method by which board meetings may be called and \nthe voting procedures to be followed, determining the offices to be filled by the directors and the powers \nwith which each officer shall be vested, fixing the method of declaring dividends, establishing a fiscal year, \nsetting out rules governing issuance and transfer of stock, and establishing the method of amending the \nbylaws. \n \nSection 2.07 of the RMBCA provides that the directors may adopt bylaws that will operate during an \nemergency. An emergency is a situation in which “a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily \nbe assembled because of some catastrophic event.” \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n608",

Distinguish between a de jure and a de facto corporation. \n2. Define the doctrine of corporation by estoppel. \n \n \nDe Jure and De Facto Corporations \nIf promoters meet the requirements of corporate formation, a de jure corporation, considered a legal \nentity, is formed. Because the various steps are complex, the formal prerequisites are not always met. \nSuppose that a company, thinking its incorporation has taken place when in fact it hasn’t met all \nrequirements, starts up its business. What then? Is everything it does null and void? If three conditions \nexist, a court might decide that a de facto corporation has been formed; that is, the business will be \nrecognized as a corporation. The state then has the power to force the de facto corporation to correct the \ndefect(s) so that a de jure corporation will be created. \n \nThe three traditional conditions are the following: (1) a statute must exist under which the corporation \ncould have been validly incorporated, (2) the promoters must have made a bona fide attempt to comply \nwith the statute, and (3) corporate powers must have been used or exercised. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n610 \nA frequent cause of defective incorporation is the promoters’ failure to file the articles of incorporation in \nthe appropriate public office. The states are split on whether a de facto corporation results if every other \nlegal requirement is met. \n \nCorporation by Estoppel \nEven if the incorporators omit important steps, it is still possible for a court, under estoppel principles, to \ntreat the business as a corporation. Assume that Bob, Carol, and Ted have sought to incorporate the BCT \nBookstore, Inc., but have failed to file the articles of incorporation. At the initial directors’ meeting, Carol \nturns over to the corporation a deed to her property. A month later, Bob discovers the omission and \nhurriedly submits the articles of incorporation to the appropriate public office. Carol decides she wants \nher land back. It is clear that the corporation was not de jure at the time she surrendered her deed, and it \nwas probably not de facto either. Can she recover the land? Under equitable principles, the answer is no. \nShe is estopped from denying the existence of the corporation, because it would be inequitable to permit \none who has conducted herself as though there were a corporation to deny its existence in order to defeat \na contract into which she willingly entered.

That is, they \nboth recognize that Jenofsky (and Graziano) was to be initially personally responsible with this personal \nresponsibility subsequently being released. Jenofsky contends the parties, by their inclusion of Paragraph \n19 in the agreement, manifested an intention to release him from personal responsibility upon the mere \nformation of the proposed corporation, provided the incorporation was consummated prior to the \nscheduled closing date. However, while Paragraph 19 does make provision for recognition of the resultant \ncorporation as to the closing documents, it makes no mention of any release of personal liability. Indeed, \nthe entire agreement is silent as to the effect the formation of the projected corporation would have upon \nthe personal liability of Jenofsky and Graziano. Because the agreement fails to provide expressly for the \nrelease of personal liability, it is, therefore, subject to more than one possible construction. \n \nIn Consolidated Tile and Slate Co. v. Fox, 410 Pa. 336,339,189 A.2d 228, 229 (1963), we stated that where \nan agreement is ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, “it must be construed most \nstrongly against those who drew it.”…Instantly, the chancellor determined that the intent of the parties to \nthe agreement was to hold Jenofsky personally responsible until such time as a corporate entity was \nformed and until such time as that corporate entity adopted the agreement. We believe this construction \nrepresents the only rational and prudent interpretation of the parties’ intent. \n \nAs found by the court below, this agreement was entered into on the financial strength of Jenofsky and \nGraziano, alone as individuals. Therefore, it would have been illogical for RKO to have consented to the \nrelease of their personal liability upon the mere formation of a resultant corporation prior to closing. For \nit is a well-settled rule that a contract made by a promoter, even though made for and in the name of a \nproposed corporation, in the absence of a subsequent adoption (either expressly or impliedly) by the \ncorporation, will not be binding upon the corporation. If, as Jenofsky contends, the intent was to release \npersonal responsibility upon the mere incorporation prior to closing, the effect of the agreement would \nhave been to create the possibility that RKO, in the event of non-performance, would be able to hold no \nparty accountable: there being no guarantee that the resultant corporation would ratify the agreement. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n621 \nWithout express language in the agreement indicating that such was the intention of the parties, we may \nnot attribute this intention to them. \n \nTherefore, we hold that the intent of the parties in entering into this agreement was to have Jenofsky and \nGraziano personally liable until such time as the intended corporation was formed and ratified the \nagreement.

International Business Machines Corp. \n234 Md. 477, 200 A.2d 33 (1964) \n \nHORNEY, JUDGE \nOn the theory that the Real Estate Service Bureau was neither a de jure nor a de facto corporation and \nthat Albion C. Cranson, Jr., was a partner in the business conducted by the Bureau and as such was \npersonally liable for its debts, the International Business Machines Corporation brought this action \nagainst Cranson for the balance due on electric typewriters purchased by the Bureau. At the same time it \nmoved for summary judgment and supported the motion by affidavit. In due course, Cranson filed a \ngeneral issue plea and an affidavit in opposition to summary judgment in which he asserted in effect that \nthe Bureau was a de facto corporation and that he was not personally liable for its debts. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n622 \nThe agreed statement of facts shows that in April 1961, Cranson was asked to invest in a new business \ncorporation which was about to be created. Towards this purpose he met with other interested individuals \nand an attorney and agreed to purchase stock and become an officer and director. Thereafter, upon being \nadvised by the attorney that the corporation had been formed under the laws of Maryland, he paid for and \nreceived a stock certificate evidencing ownership of shares in the corporation, and was shown the \ncorporate seal and minute book. The business of the new venture was conducted as if it were a",

The general sources of corporate funds \n2. The basics of corporate bonds and other debt leveraging \n3. What the various types of stocks are \n4. Initial public offerings and consideration for stock \n5. What dividends are \n6. Some of the modern trends in corporate finance \n \n \nA corporation requires money for many reasons. In this chapter, we look at the methods available to \na corporation for raising funds, focusing on how firms generate large amounts of funds and finance \nlarge projects, such as building a new factory. \n \nOne major method of finance is the sale of stock. A corporation sells shares of stock, often in an \ninitial public offering. In exchange for consideration—usually cash—the purchaser acquires stock in \nthe corporation. This stock may give the owner a share in earnings, the right to transfer the stock, \nand, depending on the size of the corporation and the number of shares, power to exercise control. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n630 \nOther methods of corporate finance include bank financing and bonds. We also discuss some more \nmodern financing methods, such as private equity and venture capital. Additional methods of \ncorporate finance, such as commercial paper (see Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial \nPaper\" and Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\"), are discussed elsewhere in this book. \n \n \n \n \n \n15.1 General Sources of Corporate Funds \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Discuss the main sources for raising corporate funds. \n2. Examine the reinvestment of earnings to finance growth. \n3. Review debt and equity as methods of raising funds. \n4. Consider private equity and venture capital, and compare their utility to other forms of financing. \n \n \nSources \nTo finance growth, any ongoing business must have a source of funds. Apart from bank and trade debt, \nthe principal sources are plowback, debt securities, equity securities, and private equity. \n \nPlowback \nA significant source of new funds that corporations spend on capital projects is earnings. Rather than \npaying out earnings to shareholders, the corporation plows those earnings back into the \nbusiness. Plowback is simply reinvesting earnings in the corporation. It is an attractive source of capital \nbecause it is subject to managerial control. No approval by governmental agencies is necessary for its \nexpenditure, as it is when a company seeks to sell securities, or stocks and bonds. Furthermore, stocks \nand bonds have costs associated with them, such as the interest payments on bonds (discussed in Section \n15.1.3 \"Debt Securities\"), while retaining profits avoids these costs. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n631 \n \nDebt Securities \nA second source of funds is borrowing through debt securities. A corporation may take out a debt security \nsuch as a loan, commonly evidenced by a note and providing security to the lender. This is covered \nin Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and Suretyship\" and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual \nLiens\". A common type of corporate debt security is a bond, which is a promise to repay the face value of \nthe bond at maturity and make periodic interest payments called the coupon rate. For example, a bond \nmay have a face value of $1,000 (the amount to be repaid at maturity) and a coupon rate of 7 percent paid \nannually; the corporation pays $70 interest on such a bond each year. Bondholders have priority over \nstockholders because a bond is a debt, and in the event of bankruptcy, creditors have priority over equity \nholders. \n \nEquity Securities \nThe third source of new capital funds is equity securities—namely, stock. Equity is an ownership interest \nin property or a business. Stock is the smallest source of new capital but is of critical importance to the \ncorporation in launching the business and its initial operations. Stock gives the investor a bundle of legal \nrights—ownership, a share in earnings, transferability and, to some extent, the power to exercise control \nthrough voting. The usual way to acquire stock is by paying cash or its equivalent as consideration. Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do",

Both \nstock and consideration are discussed in more detail in Section 15.3.2 \"Par Value and No-Par \nStock\" and Section 15.4 \"Initial Public Offerings and Consideration for Stock\". \n \nOther Forms of Finance \nWhile stock, debt securities, and reinvested profits are the most common types of finance for major \ncorporations (particularly publicly traded corporations), smaller corporations or start-ups cannot or do \nnot want to avail themselves of these financing options. Instead, they seek to raise funds through \nprivate equity, which involves private investors providing funds to a company in exchange for an \ninterest in the company. A private equity firm is a group of investors who pool their money together for \ninvestment purposes, usually to invest in other companies. Looking to private equity firms is an option for \nstart-ups—companies newly formed or in the process of being formed—that cannot raise funds through \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n632 \nthe bond market or that wish to avoid debt or a public stock sale. Start-ups need money to begin \noperations, expand, or conduct further research and development. A private equity firm might \nprovide venture capital financing for these start-ups. Generally, private equity firms that provide a lot \nof venture capital must be extremely savvy about the start-up plans of new businesses and must ask the \nstart-up entrepreneurs numerous challenging and pertinent questions. Such private equity firms expect a \nhigher rate of return on their investment than would be available from established companies. Today, \nventure capital is often used to finance entrepreneurial start-ups in biotechnology and clean technology. \n \nSometimes, a private equity firm will buy all the publicly traded shares of a company—a process \ncommonly termed “going private.” Private equity may also be involved in providing financing to \nestablished firms. \n \nAnother source of private equity is angel investors, affluent individuals who operate like venture \ncapitalists, providing capital for a business to get started in exchange for repayment with interest or an \nownership interest. The main difference between an angel investor and a venture capitalist is the source of \nfunds: an angel investor invests his or her own money, while venture capitalists use pooled funds. \n \nPrivate equity firms may also use a leveraged buyout (LBO) to finance the acquisition of another firm. \nDiscussed further in Chapter 18 \"Corporate Expansion, State and Federal Regulation of Foreign \nCorporations, and Corporate Dissolution\" on Corporate Expansion, in the realm of private equity, an LBO \nis a financing option using debt to acquire another firm. In an LBO, private equity investors use the assets \nof the target corporation as collateral for a loan to purchase that target corporation. Such investors may \npursue an LBO as a debt acquisition option since they do not need to use much—or even any—of their own \nmoney in order to finance the acquisition. \n \nA major drawback to private equity, whether through a firm or through venture capital, is the risk versus \nreturn trade-off. Private equity investors may demand a significant interest in the firm, or a high return, \nto compensate them for the riskiness of their investment. They may demand a say in how the firm is \noperated or a seat on the board of directors. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n633 \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThere are four main sources of corporate finance. The first is plowback, or reinvesting profits in the \ncorporation. The second is borrowing, commonly through a bond issue. A corporation sells a bond, agreeing to \nperiodic interest payments and repayment of the face value of the bond at maturity. The third source is \nequity, usually stock, whereby a corporation sells an ownership interest in the corporation. The fourth source \nis private equity and venture capital. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Would Griffitts be liable for the $5,000 difference between the actual value of his services \nand the stock’s par value? This is the problem of watered stock: the inflated consideration is in fact less \nthan par value. The term itself comes from the ancient fraud of farmers and ranchers who increased the \nweight of their cattle (also known as stock) by forcing them to ingest excess water. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n646 \nThe majority of states follow the good-faith rule. As noted near the end of the United Steel \nIndustries case, in the absence of fraud, “the judgment of the board of directors ‘as to the value of \nconsideration received for shares’ is conclusive.” In other words, if the directors or shareholders conclude \nin good faith that the consideration does fairly reflect par value, then the stock is not watered and the \nstock buyer cannot be assessed for the difference. This is in line with the business judgment rule, \ndiscussed in Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\". If the directors concluded in good faith \nthat the consideration provided by Griffitts’s services accurately reflected the value of the shares, they \nwould not be liable. The minority approach is the true value rule: the consideration must in fact equal par \nvalue by an objective standard at the time the shares are issued, regardless of the board’s good-faith \njudgment. \n \nA shareholder may commence a derivative lawsuit (a suit by a shareholder, on behalf of the corporation, \noften filed against the corporation; see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers and Management\"). In a watered \nstock lawsuit, the derivative suit is filed against a shareholder who has failed to pay full consideration \nunder either rule to recover the difference between the value received by the corporation and the par \nvalue. \n \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nCorporations may raise funds through the sale of stock. This can be accomplished through an initial public \noffering (IPO)—the first time a corporation sells stock—or through stock sales after an IPO. The SEC is the \nregulatory body that oversees the sale of stock. A sale of stock has several benefits for the corporation, such \nas avoiding the use of debt, which can be much more expensive than selling stock. Stock sales also increase \nthe firm’s exposure and attract investors who prefer more risk than bonds. On the other hand, stock sales \nhave some disadvantages, namely, the dilution of ownership of the corporation. Also, the corporation may \nundervalue its shares, thus missing out on additional capital because of the undervaluation. Being a publicly \ntraded company places the corporation under the extensive requirements of the SEC and the 1933 and 1934 \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n647 \nsecurities acts, such as shareholder meetings and annual financial reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act adds yet \nmore requirements that a corporation may wish to avoid. \nConsideration is property or services exchanged for stock. Most investors will exchange money for stock. \nCertain forms of consideration are not permitted. Finally, a corporation may be liable if it sells watered stock, \nwhere consideration received by the corporation is less than the stock par value. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Describe the process of conducting an IPO. \n2. What are some advantages of selling stock? \n3. What are some disadvantages of selling stock? \n4. What is consideration?

The law does not require a \ncorporation to give out a specific type of dividend. \n \nCash Dividend \nIf a company’s finances are such that it can declare a dividend to stockholders, a cash dividend always is \npermissible. It is a payment (by check, ordinarily) to the stockholders of a certain amount of money per \nshare. Under current law, qualified dividends are taxed as a long-term capital gain (usually 15 percent, but \nthe figure can be as low as zero percent under current law). These rules are set to expire in 2013, when \ndividends will be taxed as ordinary income (i.e., at the recipient’s ordinary income tax rate). \n \nStock Dividend",

Such dividends are known as nimble dividends. See \nWeinberg v. Baltimore Brick Co. [2] \n \nDistribution from Capital Surplus \nAssets in the form of cash or property may be distributed from capital surplus if the articles of \nincorporation so provide or if shareholders approve the distribution. Such distributions must be identified \nto the shareholders as coming from capital surplus. \n \n \n \nRecord Date, Payment Date, Rights of Stockholders \nUnder the securities exchange rules, the board of directors cannot simply declare a dividend payable on \nthe date of the board meeting and instruct the treasurer to hand out cash. The board must fix two dates: a \nrecord date and a payment date. By the first, the board declares a dividend for shareholders of record as of \na certain future date—perhaps ten days hence. Actual payment of the dividend is postponed until the \npayment date, which could be a month after the record date. \n \nThe board’s action creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the corporation and its shareholders. \nThe company may not revoke a cash dividend unless the shareholders consent. It may revoke a share \ndividend as long as the shares have not been issued. \n \nDiscretion of Directors to Pay Dividends \nWhen Directors Are Too Stingy \nIn every state, dividends are normally payable only at the discretion of the directors. Courts will order \ndistribution only if they are expressly mandatory or if it can be shown that the directors abused their \ndiscretion by acting fraudulently or in a manner that was manifestly unreasonable. Dodge v. Ford Motor \nCo., (see Section 15.7.2 \"Payment of Dividends\"), involves Henry Ford’s refusal in 1916 to pay dividends in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n651 \norder to reinvest profits; it is often celebrated in business annals because of Ford’s testimony at trial, \nalthough, as it turned out, the courts held his refusal to be an act of miserliness and an abuse of discretion. \nDespite this ruling, many corporations today do not pay dividends. Corporations may decide to reinvest \nprofits in the corporation rather than pay a dividend to its shareholders, or to just sit on the cash. For \nexample, Apple Computer, Inc., maker of many popular computers and consumer electronics, saw its \nshare price skyrocket in the late 2000s. Apple also became one of the most valuable corporations in the \nworld. Despite an immense cash reserve, Apple has refused to pay a dividend, choosing instead to reinvest \nin the business, stating that they require a large cash reserve as a security blanket for acquisitions or to \ndevelop new products. Thus despite the ruling in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co., courts will usually not \nintercede in a corporation’s decision not to pay dividends, following the business judgment rule and the \nduties of directors. (For further discussion of the duties of directors, see Chapter 16 \"Corporate Powers \nand Management\"). \n \nWhen Directors Are Too Generous \nDirectors who vote to declare and distribute dividends in excess of those allowed by law or by provisions \nin the articles of incorporation personally may become jointly and severally liable to the corporation (but \nliability may be reduced or eliminated under the business judgment rule). Shareholders who receive a \ndividend knowing it is unlawful must repay any directors held liable for voting the illegal dividend. The \ndirectors are said to be entitled to contribution from such shareholders. Even when directors have not \nbeen sued, some courts have held that shareholders must repay dividends received when the corporation \nis insolvent or when they know that the dividends are illegal. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA dividend is a payment made from the corporation to its shareholders. A corporation may pay dividends \nthrough a variety of methods, although money and additional shares are the most common. Corporations may \nincrease or decrease the total number of shares through either a stock split or a reverse stock split. A \ncorporation may decide to pay dividends but is not required to do so and cannot issue dividends if the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n652 \ncorporation is insolvent.

No plan of operations \ncould be adopted unless he consented, and no board of directors can be elected whom he does not favor. \nOne of the directors of the company has no stock. One share was assigned to him to qualify him for the \nposition, but it is not claimed that he owns it. A business, one of the largest in the world, and one of the \nmost profitable, has been built up. It employs many men, at good pay. \n \n“My ambition,” said Mr. Ford, “is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this \nindustrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their \nhomes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.” \n \n“With regard to dividends, the company paid sixty per cent on its capitalization of two million \ndollars, or $1,200,000, leaving $58,000,000 to reinvest for the growth of the company. This is \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n660 \nMr. Ford’s policy at present, and it is understood that the other stockholders cheerfully accede to \nthis plan.” \n \nHe had made up his mind in the summer of 1916 that no dividends other than the regular dividends \nshould be paid, “for the present.” \n \n“Q.

That was indefinite, yes, sir.” \n \nThe record, and especially the testimony of Mr. Ford, convinces that he has to some extent the attitude \ntowards shareholders of one who has dispensed and distributed to them large gains and that they should \nbe content to take what he chooses to give. His testimony creates the impression, also, that he thinks the \nFord Motor Company has made too much money, has had too large profits, and that although large profits \nmight be still earned, a sharing of them with the public, by reducing the price of the output of the \ncompany, ought to be undertaken. We have no doubt that certain sentiments, philanthropic and altruistic, \ncreditable to Mr. Ford, had large influence in determining the policy to be pursued by the Ford Motor \nCompany—the policy which has been herein referred to. \n \n* * * \n \nThe difference between an incidental humanitarian expenditure of corporate funds for the benefit of the \nemployees, like the building of a hospital for their use and the employment of agencies for the betterment \nof their condition, and a general purpose and plan to benefit mankind at the expense of others, is obvious. \nThere should be no confusion (of which there is evidence) of the duties which Mr. Ford conceives that he \nand the stockholders owe to the general public and the duties which in law he and his codirectors owe to \nprotesting, minority stockholders. A business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n661 \nprofit of the stockholders.

Would the business judgment rule have changed the outcome of this case? Note: The business judgment \nrule, generally summarized, is that the directors are presumed to act in the best interest of the \ncorporation and its shareholders and to fulfill their fiduciary duties of good faith, loyalty, and due care. \nThe burden is on the plaintiff to prove that a transaction was so one sided that no business person of \nordinary judgment would conclude that the transaction was proper and/or fair. \n \n \n \n \n15.8 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nCorporations finance through a variety of mechanisms. One method is to reinvest profits in the \ncorporation. Another method is to use private equity. Private equity involves financing from private \ninvestors, whether individuals (angel investors) or a private equity firm. Venture capital is often used as a \nfundraising mechanism by businesses that are just starting operations. \n \nA third method is to finance through debt, such as a loan or a bond. A corporation sells a bond and agrees \nto make interest payments over the life of the bond and to pay the face value of the bond at the bond’s \nmaturity. \nThe final important method of raising capital is by the sale of stock. The articles of incorporation govern \nthe total number of shares of stock that the corporation may issue, although it need not issue the \nmaximum. Stock in the hands of shareholders is said to be authorized, issued, and outstanding. Stock may \nhave a par value, which is usually the floor price of the stock. No-par shares may be sold for any price set \nby the directors. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n663 \nPreferred stock (1) may have a dividend preference, (2) takes preference upon liquidation, and (3) may be \nconvertible. Common stock normally has the right to (1) ratable participation in earnings, (2) ratable \nparticipation in the distribution of net assets on liquidation, and (3) ratable vote. \n \nOrdinarily, the good-faith judgment of the directors concerning the fair value of the consideration \nreceived for stock is determinative. A minority of states adhere to a true value rule that holds to an \nobjective standard. \n \nA corporation that sells shares for the first time engages in an initial public offering (IPO). The Securities \nAct of 1933 governs most IPOs and initial stock sales. A corporation that has previously issued stock may \ndo so many times afterward, depending on the corporation’s needs. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 \ngoverns most secondary market stock sales. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 adds another layer of \nregulation to the financial transactions discussed in this chapter. \n \nA dividend is a share of a corporation’s profits. Dividends may be distributed as cash, property, or stock. \nThe law imposes certain limitations on the amount that the corporation may disburse; most states restrict \nthe cash or property available for distribution to earned surplus. However, a few states, including \nDelaware, permit dividends to be paid out of the net of current earnings and those of the immediately \npreceding year, both years taken as a single period; these are known as nimble dividends.

The shareholders “own” \nthe company through their ownership of its stock, but power to manage is vested in the directors. In a \nlarge publicly traded corporation, most of the ownership of the corporation is diluted across its numerous \nshareholders, many of whom have no involvement with the corporation other than through their stock \nownership. On the other hand, the issue of separation and control is generally irrelevant to the closely \nheld corporation, since in many instances the shareholders are the same people who manage and work for \nthe corporation. \nShareholders do retain some degree of control. For example, they elect the directors, although only a \nsmall fraction of shareholders control the outcome of most elections because of the diffusion of ownership \nand modern proxy rules; proxy fights are extremely difficult for insurgents to win. Shareholders also may \nadopt, amend, and repeal the corporation’s bylaws; they may adopt resolutions ratifying or refusing to \nratify certain actions of the directors. And they must vote on certain extraordinary matters, such as \nwhether to amend the articles of incorporation, merge, or liquidate. \n \nMeetings \nIn most states, the corporation must hold at least one meeting of shareholders each year. The board of \ndirectors or shareholders representing at least 10 percent of the stock may call a special shareholders’ \nmeeting at any time unless a different threshold number is stated in the articles or bylaws. Timely notice \nis required: not more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the meeting, under Section 7.05 of the \nRevised Model Business Corporation Act (RMBCA). Shareholders may take actions without a meeting if \nevery shareholder entitled to vote consents in writing to the action to be taken. This option is obviously \nuseful to the closely held corporation but not to the giant publicly held companies. \n \nRight to Vote \nWho Has the Right to Vote? \nThrough its bylaws or by resolution of the board of directors, a corporation can set a “record date.” Only",

A \nstaggered board allows for the continuity of directors or as a defense against a hostile takeover. \n \nDirectors’ Qualifications and Characteristics \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n682 \nThe statutes do not catalog qualifications that directors are expected to possess. In most states, directors \nneed not be residents of the state or shareholders of the corporation unless required by the articles of \nincorporation or bylaws, which may also set down more precise qualifications if desired. \n \nUntil the 1970s, directors tended to be a homogeneous lot: white male businessmen or lawyers. Political \nchange—rising consumer, environmental, and public interest consciousness—and embarrassment \nstemming from disclosures made in the wake of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \ninvestigations growing out of Watergate prompted companies to diversify their boardrooms. Today, \nmembers of minority groups and women are being appointed in increasing numbers, although their \nproportion to the total is still small. Outside directors (directors who are not employees, officers, or \notherwise associated with the corporation; they are also called nonexecutive directors) are becoming a \npotent force on corporate boards. The trend to promote the use of outside directors has continued—the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 places emphasis on the use of outside directors to provide balance to the \nboard and protect the corporation’s investors. \n \nRemoval of Directors and Officers \nIn 1978, one week before he was scheduled to unveil the 1979 Mustang to trade journalists in person, Lee \nIacocca, president of the Ford Motor Company, was summarily fired by unanimous vote of the board of \ndirectors, although his departure was billed as a resignation. Iacocca was reported to have asked company \nchairman Henry Ford II, “What did I do wrong?” To which Ford was said to have replied, “I just don’t like \nyou.” [1] To return to our usual example: BCT Bookstore is set to announce its acquisition of Borders \nGroup, Inc., a large book retailer that is facing bankruptcy. Alice, one of BCT’s directors, was instrumental \nin the acquisition. One day prior to the announcement of the acquisition, BCT’s board relieved Alice of her \ndirectorship, providing no reason for the decision. The story raises this question: May a corporate officer, \nor director for that matter, be fired without cause? \n \nYes. Many state statutes expressly permit the board to fire an officer with or without cause. However, \nremoval does not defeat an officer’s rights under an employment contract. Shareholders may remove \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n683 \ndirectors with or without cause at any meeting called for the purpose. A majority of the shares entitled to \nvote, not a majority of the shares represented at the meeting, are required for removal. \n \nMeetings \nDirectors must meet, but the statutes themselves rarely prescribe how frequently. More often, rules \nprescribing time and place are set out in the bylaws, which may permit members to participate in any \nmeeting by conference telephone. In practice, the frequency of board meetings varies. \n \nThe board or committees of the board may take action without meeting if all members of the board or \ncommittee consent in writing. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum, unless the \nbylaws or articles of incorporation specify a larger number. Likewise, a majority present at the meeting is \nsufficient to carry any motion unless the articles or bylaws specify a larger number. \n \nCompensation \nIn the past, directors were supposed to serve without pay, as shareholder representatives. The modern \npractice is to permit the board to determine its own pay unless otherwise fixed in the articles of \nincorporation. Directors’ compensation has risen sharply in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, however, has made significant changes to compensation, \nallowing shareholders a “say on pay,” or the ability to vote on compensation. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nThe directors exercise corporate powers.

Examine the fiduciary duties owed by directors and officers. \n2. Consider constituency statutes. \n3. Discuss modern trends in corporate compliance and fiduciary duties. \nNature of the Problem \nNot so long ago, boards of directors of large companies were quiescent bodies, virtual rubber stamps for \ntheir friends among management who put them there. By the late 1970s, with the general increase in the \nclimate of litigiousness, one out of every nine companies on the Fortune 500 list saw its directors or \nofficers hit with claims for violation of their legal responsibilities. [1] In a seminal case, the Delaware \nSupreme Court found that the directors of TransUnion were grossly negligent in accepting a buyout price \nof $55 per share without sufficient inquiry or advice on the adequacy of the price, a breach of their duty of \ncare owed to the shareholders. The directors were held liable for $23.5 million for this breach. [2] Thus \nserving as a director or an officer was never free of business risks. Today, the task is fraught with legal risk \nas well. \n \nTwo main fiduciary duties apply to both directors and officers: one is a duty of loyalty, the other the duty \nof care. These duties arise from responsibilities placed upon directors and officers because of their \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n685 \npositions within the corporation. The requirements under these duties have been refined over time. \nCourts and legislatures have both narrowed the duties by defining what is or is not a breach of each duty \nand have also expanded their scope. Courts have further refined the duties, such as laying out tests such \nas in the Caremark case, outlined in Section 16.4.3 \"Duty of Care\". Additionally, other duties have been \ndeveloped, such as the duties of good faith and candor. \n \nDuty of Loyalty \nAs a fiduciary of the corporation, the director owes his primary loyalty to the corporation and its \nstockholders, as do the officers and majority shareholders. This responsibility is called \nthe duty of loyalty. When there is a conflict between a director’s personal interest and the interest of the \ncorporation, he is legally bound to put the corporation’s interest above his own. This duty was mentioned \nin Exercise 3 of Section 16.2 \"Rights of Shareholders\" when Ted usurped a corporate opportunity and will \nbe discussed later in this section. \n \nFigure 16.3 Common Conflict Situations \n \n \n \nTwo situations commonly give rise to the director or officer’s duty of loyalty: (1) contracts with the \ncorporation and (2) corporate opportunity (see Figure 16.3 \"Common Conflict Situations\"). \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n686 \nContracts with the Corporation \nThe law does not bar a director from contracting with the corporation he serves. However, unless the \ncontract or transaction is “fair to the corporation,” Sections 8.61, 8.62, and 8.63 of the Revised Model \nBusiness Corporation Act (RMBCA) impose on him a stringent duty of disclosure. In the absence of a fair \ntransaction, a contract between the corporation and one of its directors is voidable. If the transaction is \nunfair to the corporation, it may still be permitted if the director has made full disclosure of his personal \nrelationship or interest in the contract and if disinterested board members or shareholders approve the \ntransaction. \n \nCorporate Opportunity \nWhenever a director or officer learns of an opportunity to engage in a variety of activities or transactions \nthat might be beneficial to the corporation, his first obligation is to present the opportunity to the",

A director of a \nsmall, closely held corporation will not necessarily be held to the same standard as a director who is given \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n688 \na staff by a large, complex, diversified company. The standard of care is that which an ordinarily prudent \nperson would use who is in “a like position” to the director in question. Moreover, the standard is not a \ntimeless one for all people in the same position. The standard can depend on the circumstances: a fast-\nmoving situation calling for a snap decision will be treated differently later, if there are recriminations \nbecause it was the wrong decision, than a situation in which time was not of the essence. \n \nWhat of the care itself? What kind of care would an ordinarily prudent person in any situation be required \nto give? Unlike the standard of care, which can differ, the care itself has certain requirements. At a \nminimum, the director must pay attention. He must attend meetings, receive and digest information \nadequate to inform him about matters requiring board action, and monitor the performance of those to \nwhom he has delegated the task of operating the corporation. Of course, documents can be misleading, \nreports can be slanted, and information coming from self-interested management can be distorted. To \nwhat heights must suspicion be raised? Section 8.30 of the RMBCA forgives directors the necessity of \nplaying detective whenever information, including financial data, is received in an apparently reliable \nmanner from corporate officers or employees or from experts such as attorneys and public accountants. \nThus the director does not need to check with another attorney once he has received financial data from \none competent attorney. \n \nA New Jersey Supreme Court decision considered the requirements of fiduciary duties, particularly the \nduty of care. Pritchard & Baird was a reissuance corporation owned by Pritchard and having four \ndirectors: Pritchard, his wife, and his two sons. Pritchard and his sons routinely took loans from the \naccounts of the firm’s clients. After Pritchard died, his sons increased their borrowing, eventually sending \nthe business into bankruptcy. During this time, Mrs. Pritchard developed a fondness for alcohol, drinking \nheavily and paying little attention to her directorship responsibilities. Creditors sued Mrs. Pritchard for \nbreaches of her fiduciary duties, essentially arguing that the bankruptcy would not have occurred had she \nbeen acting properly. After both the trial court and appellate court found for the creditors, the New Jersey \nSupreme Court took up the case. The court held that a director must have a basic understanding of the \nbusiness of the corporation upon whose board he or she sits. This can be accomplished by attending \nmeetings, reviewing and understanding financial documents, investigating irregularities, and generally \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n689 \nbeing involved in the corporation. The court found that Mrs. Pritchard’s being on the board because she \nwas the spouse was insufficient to excuse her behavior, and that had she been performing her duties, she \ncould have prevented the bankruptcy. [6] \n \nDespite the fiduciary requirements, in reality a director does not spend all his time on corporate affairs, is \nnot omnipotent, and must be permitted to rely on the word of others. Nor can directors be infallible in \nmaking decisions. Managers work in a business environment, in which risk is a substantial factor. No \ndecision, no matter how rigorously debated, is guaranteed. Accordingly, courts will not second-guess \ndecisions made on the basis of good-faith judgment and due care. This is the business judgment rule, \nmentioned in previous chapters. The business judgment rule was coming into prominence as early as 1919 \nin Dodge v. Ford, discussed in Chapter 15 \"Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance\". It has been a pillar of \ncorporate law ever since. As described by the Delaware Supreme Court: “The business judgment rule is an \nacknowledgment of the managerial prerogatives of Delaware directors.…It is a presumption that in \nmaking a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in \nthe honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.” [7] \n \nUnder the business judgment rule, the actions of directors who fulfill their fiduciary duties will not be \nsecond-guessed by a court. The general test is whether a director’s decision or transaction was so one \nsided that no businessperson of ordinary judgment would reach the same decision. The business \njudgment rule has been refined over time. While the business judgment rule may seem to provide blanket \nprotection for directors (the rule was quite broad as outlined by the court in Dodge v. Ford), this is not the \ncase. The rule does not protect every decision made by directors, and they may face lawsuits, a topic to",

Technicolor, \nInc., [8] In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, [9] and Smith v. Van Gorkom. [10] \n \nIf a shareholder is not pleased by a director’s decision, that shareholder may file a derivative suit. The \nderivative suit may be filed by a shareholder on behalf of the corporation against directors or officers of \nthe corporation, alleging breach of their fiduciary obligations. However, a shareholder, as a prerequisite to \nfiling a derivative action, must first demand that the board of directors take action, as the actual party in \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n690 \ninterest is the corporation, not the shareholder (meaning that if the shareholder is victorious in the \nlawsuit, it is actually the corporation that “wins”). If the board refuses, is its decision protected by the \nbusiness judgment rule? The general rule is that the board may refuse to file a derivative suit and will be \nprotected by the business judgment rule. And even when a derivative suit is filed, directors can be \nprotected by the business judgment rule for decisions even the judge considers to have been poorly made. \nSee In re The Walt Disney Co. Derivative Litigation, (see Section 16.5.2 \"Business Judgment Rule\"). \n \nIn a battle for control of a corporation, directors (especially “inside” directors, who are employees of the \ncorporation, such as officers) often have an inherent self-interest in preserving their positions, which can \nlead them to block mergers that the shareholders desire and that may be in the firm’s best interest. As a \nresult, Delaware courts have modified the usual business judgment presumption in this situation. \nIn Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum, [11] for instance, the court held that directors who adopt a defensive \nmechanism “must show that they had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy \nand effectiveness existed.…[T]hey satisfy that burden ‘by showing good faith and reasonable \ninvestigation.’” The business judgment rule clearly does not protect every decision of the board. \nThe Unocal court developed a test for the board: the directors may only work to prevent a takeover when \nthey can demonstrate a threat to the policies of the corporation and that any defensive measures taken to \nprevent the takeover were reasonable and proportional given the depth of the threat. The Unocal test was \nmodified further by requiring a finding, before a court steps in, that the actions of a board were coercive, a \nstep back toward the business judgment rule. [12] \n \nIn a widely publicized case, the Delaware Supreme Court held that the board of Time, Inc. met \nthe Unocal test—that the board reasonably concluded that a tender offer by Paramount constituted a \nthreat and acted reasonably in rejecting Paramount’s offer and in merging with Warner \nCommunications. [13] \n \nThe specific elements of the fiduciary duties are not spelled out in stone. For example, the Delaware \ncourts have laid out three factors to examine when determining whether a duty of care has been \nbreached: [14] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n691 \n \n1. The directors knew, or should have known, that legal breaches were occurring. \n2. The directors took no steps to prevent or resolve the situation. \n3. This failure caused the losses about which the shareholder is complaining in a derivative suit. \n \nThus the court expanded the duty of oversight (which is included under the umbrella of the duty of care; \nthese duties are often referred to as the Caremark duties). Furthermore, courts have recognized \na duty of good faith—a duty to act honestly and avoid violations of corporate norms and business \npractices.[15] Therefore, the split in ownership and decision making within the corporate structure causes \nrifts, and courts are working toward balancing the responsibilities of the directors to their shareholders \nwith their ability to run the corporation. \n \nConstituency Statutes and Corporate Social Responsibility \nUntil the 1980s, the law in all the states imposed on corporate directors the obligation to advance \nshareholders’ economic interests to ensure the long-term profitability of the corporation.

While the main goal of Sarbanes-Oxley is to decrease the incidents of \nfinancial fraud and accounting tricks, its operative goal is to strengthen the fiduciary duties of loyalty and \ncare as well as good faith. \n \nThe modern trend has been to impose more duties. Delaware has been adding to the list of fiduciary \nresponsibilities other than loyalty and care. As mentioned previously, the Delaware judicial system \nconsistently recognizes a duty of good faith. The courts have further added a duty of candor with \nshareholders when the corporation is disseminating information to its investors. Particular duties arise in \nthe context of mergers, acquisitions, and tender offers. As mentioned previously in the Revlon case, the \nduty owed to shareholders in situations of competing tender offers is that of maximum value. Other duties \nmay arise, such as when directors attempt to retain their positions on the board in the face of a hostile \ntender offer. Trends in fiduciary responsibilities, as well as other changes in the business legal field, are \ncovered extensively by the American Bar Association \nat http://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law.html. \n \nLiability Prevention and Insurance \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n695 \nAlice, the director of BCT, has been charged with breaching her duty of care. Is she personally liable for a \nbreach of the duty of care? How can a director avoid liability? Of course, she can never avoid defending a \nlawsuit, for in the wake of any large corporate difficulty—from a thwarted takeover bid to a bankruptcy—\nsome group of shareholders will surely sue. But the director can immunize herself ultimately by carrying \nout her duties of loyalty and care. In practice, this often means that she should be prepared to document \nthe reasonableness of her reliance on information from all sources considered. Second, if the director \ndissents from action that she considers mistaken or unlawful, she should ensure that her negative vote is \nrecorded. Silence is construed as assent to any proposition before the board, and assent to a woefully \nmistaken action can be the basis for staggering liability. \n \nCorporations, however, are permitted to limit or eliminate the personal liability of its directors. For \nexample, Delaware law permits the articles of incorporation to contain a provision eliminating or limiting \nthe personal liability of directors to the corporation, with some limitations. [18] \n \nBeyond preventive techniques, another measure of protection from director liability \nis indemnification (reimbursement). In most states, the corporation may agree under certain \ncircumstances to indemnify directors, officers, and employees for expenses resulting from litigation when \nthey are made party to suits involving the corporation. In third-party actions (those brought by outsiders), \nthe corporation may reimburse the director, officer, or employee for all expenses (including attorneys’ \nfees), judgments, fines, and settlement amounts. In derivative actions, the corporation’s power to \nindemnify is more limited. For example, reimbursement for litigation expenses of directors adjudged \nliable for negligence or misconduct is allowed only if the court approves. In both third-party and \nderivative actions, the corporation must provide indemnification expenses when the defense is successful. \n \nWhether or not they have the power to indemnify, corporations may purchase liability insurance for \ndirectors, officers, and employees (for directors and officers, the insurance is commonly referred to as \nD&O insurance). But insurance policies do not cover every act. Most exclude “willful negligence” and \ncriminal conduct in which intent is a necessary element of proof. Furthermore, the cost of liability \ninsurance has increased dramatically in recent years, causing some companies to cancel their coverage. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n696 \nThis, in turn, jeopardizes the recent movement toward outside directors because many directors might \nprefer to leave or decline to serve on boards that have inadequate liability coverage. As a result, most \nstates have enacted legislation that allows a corporation, through a charter amendment approved by \nshareholders, to limit the personal liability of its outside directors for failing to exercise due care. In 1990, \nSection 2.02 of the RMBCA was amended to provide that the articles of incorporation may include “a \nprovision eliminating or limiting the liability of a director to the corporation or its shareholders for money \ndamages.…” This section includes certain exceptions; for example, the articles may not limit liability for \nintentional violations of criminal law.

Each of the individual defendants is a director of the \ncorporation, and together the individual defendants constitute the entire board of directors. The \ncertificate of incorporation sets forth that the sole purpose of the corporation is “to provide facilities for \nthe serving of luncheon or other meals to members.” Neither the certificate of incorporation nor the \nbylaws of the corporation contain any qualifications for membership, nor does either contain any \nrestrictions on the luncheon guests members may bring to the club.

Shortly after both of the above occurrences, the board of directors conducted two separate \npollings of its members, one by mail, the other by a special meeting held to vote on four alternative \nproposals for amending the bylaws of corporation concerning the admission of women members and \nguests. None of these proposed amendments to the bylaws received the required number of votes for \nadoption. Following that balloting, the plaintiff again wrote to the president of the corporation and asked \nthat the directors stop interfering with his rights as a member to bring women guests to the luncheon \nfacility and to propose women for membership. The president’s reply was that “the existing bylaws, house \nrules and customs continue in effect, and therefore [the board] consider[s] the matter closed.” \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n699 \n \n* * * \n \nIn addition to seeking a declaratory judgment which will inform him of his rights vis-à-vis the corporation \nand its directors, the plaintiff is also seeking injunctive relief, orders directing the admission of the \nplaintiff’s candidate to membership and denying indemnity to the directors, money damages, and costs \nand expenses including reasonable attorney’s fees. It should be noted at the outset that the plaintiff is not \nmaking a claim under either the federal or state civil rights or equal accommodations statutes, but that he \nis solely asserting his membership rights under the certificate of incorporation, the bylaws, and the \nstatutes governing the regulation of this nonstock corporation. As such, this is a case of first impression in \nConnecticut. \n \n* * * \nConnecticut has codified the common-law right of a member to proceed against his corporation or its \ndirectors in the event of an ultra vires act. In fact, it has been done specifically under the Nonstock \nCorporation Act. \n \nNo powers were given to the defendant corporation in its certificate of incorporation, only a purpose, and \nas a result the only incidental powers which the defendant would have under the common law are those \nwhich are necessary to effect its purpose, that being to serve lunch to its members. Since the club was not \nformed for the purpose of having an exclusively male luncheon club, it cannot be considered necessary to \nits stated purpose for the club to have the implied power at common law to exclude women members. \n \nUnder the Connecticut Nonstock Corporation Act, the corporation could have set forth in its certificate of \nincorporation that its purpose was to engage in any lawful activity permitted that corporation. That was \nnot done. Its corporate purposes were very narrowly stated to be solely for providing “facilities for the \nserving of luncheon or other meals to members.” The certificate did not restrict the purpose to the serving \nof male members. Section 33-428 of the General Statutes provides that the corporate powers of a \nnonstock corporation are those set forth in the Nonstock Corporation Act, those specifically stated in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n700 \ncertificate of incorporation, neither of which includes the power to exclude women members, and the \nimplied power to “exercise all legal powers necessary or convenient to effect any or all of the purposes \nstated in its certificate of incorporation.…” \n \nWe come, thus, to the nub of this controversy and the basic legal question raised by the facts in this case: \nIs it necessary or convenient to the purpose for which this corporation was organized for it to exclude \nwomen members?

This court concludes that it is not. While a corporation might be organized for the \nnarrower purpose of providing a luncheon club for men only, this one was not so organized. Its stated \npurpose is broader and this court cannot find that it is either necessary or convenient to that purpose for \nits membership to be restricted to men. It should be borne in mind that this club is one of the principal \nluncheon clubs for business and professional people in Stamford. It is a gathering place where a great \nmany of the civic, business, and professional affairs of the Stamford community are discussed in an \natmosphere of social intercourse. Given the scope of the entry of women today into the business and \nprofessional life of the community and the changing status of women before the law and in society, it \nwould be anomalous indeed for this court to conclude that it is either necessary or convenient to the \nstated purpose for which it was organized for this club to exclude women as members or guests. \n \nWhile the bylaws recognize the right of a member to bring guests to the club, the exclusion of women \nguests is nowhere authorized and would not appear to be any more necessary and convenient to the \npurpose of the club than the exclusion of women members. The bylaws at present contain no restrictions \nagainst female members or guests and even if they could be interpreted as authorizing those restrictions, \nthey would be of no validity in light of the requirement of § 33-459 (a) of the General Statutes, that the \nbylaws must be “reasonable [and] germane to the purposes of the corporation.…” \n \nThe court therefore concludes that the actions and policies of the defendants in excluding women as \nmembers and guests solely on the basis of sex is ultra vires and beyond the power of the corporation and \nits management under its certificate of incorporation and the Nonstock Corporation Act, and in \nderogation of the rights of the plaintiff as a member thereof.

The negotiations regarding Ovitz’s compensation were \nconducted predominantly by Eisner and two of the members of the compensation committee (a four-\nmember panel). The terms of Ovitz’s compensation were then presented to the full board. In a meeting \nlasting around one hour, where a variety of topics were discussed, the board approved Ovitz’s \ncompensation after reviewing only a term sheet rather than the full contract. Ovitz’s time at Disney was \ntumultuous and short-lived.]…In December 1996, only fourteen months after he commenced \nemployment, Ovitz was terminated without cause, resulting in a severance payout to Ovitz valued at \napproximately $ 130 million. [Disney shareholders then filed derivative actions on behalf of Disney \nagainst Ovitz and the directors of Disney at the time of the events complained of (the “Disney \ndefendants”), claiming that the $130 million severance payout was the product of fiduciary duty and \ncontractual breaches by Ovitz and of breaches of fiduciary duty by the Disney defendants and a waste of \nassets. The Chancellor found in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n702 \nWe next turn to the claims of error that relate to the Disney defendants. Those claims are subdivisible into \ntwo groups: (A) claims arising out of the approval of the OEA [Ovitz employment agreement] and of \nOvitz’s election as President; and (B) claims arising out of the NFT [nonfault termination] severance \npayment to Ovitz upon his termination.

Some states say that in the \nabsence of such a provision, shareholders do have preemptive rights; others say that there are no \npreemptive rights unless the articles specifically include them. \n \nDirectors have the ultimate authority to run the corporation and are fiduciaries of the firm. In large \ncorporations, directors delegate day-to-day management to salaried officers, whom they may fire, in most \nstates, without cause.

Any director or officer is obligated to inform fellow directors of \nany corporate opportunity that affects the company and may not act personally on it unless he has \nreceived approval. The duty of care is the obligation to act “with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a \nlike position would exercise under similar circumstances.” Other fiduciary duties have also been \nrecognized, and constituency statutes permit the corporation to consider factors other than shareholders \nin making decisions.

The prospectus went on to list specific risks. \nDespite this daunting compilation of troublesome details, the SEC permitted the offering because all \ndisclosures were made (Wall Street Journal, December 29, 1981). It is the business of the marketplace, \nnot the SEC, to determine whether the risk is worth taking. \n \nThe SEC enforces securities laws through two primary federal acts: The Securities Act of 1933 and The \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. \n \nSecurities Act of 1933 \nGoals \nThe Securities Act of 1933 is the fundamental “truth in securities” law. Its two basic objectives, which \nare written in its preamble, are “to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in \ninterstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof.” \n \nRegistration \nThe primary means for realizing these goals is the requirement of registration. Before securities subject to \nthe act can be offered to the public, the issuer must file a registration statement and prospectus with \nthe SEC, laying out in detail relevant and material information about the offering as set forth in various \nschedules to the act. If the SEC approves the registration statement, the issuer must then provide any \nprospective purchaser with the prospectus. Since the SEC does not pass on the fairness of price or other \nterms of the offering, it is unlawful to state or imply in the prospectus that the commission has the power \nto disapprove securities for lack of merit, thereby suggesting that the offering is meritorious. \n \nThe SEC has prepared special forms for registering different types of issuing companies. All call for a \ndescription of the registrant’s business and properties and of the significant provisions of the security to \nbe offered, facts about how the issuing company is managed, and detailed financial statements certified by \nindependent public accountants. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n719 \nOnce filed, the registration and prospectus become public and are open for public inspection. Ordinarily, \nthe effective date of the registration statement is twenty days after filing. Until then, the offering may not \nbe made to the public. Section 2(10) of the act defines prospectus as any “notice, circular, advertisement, \nletter, or communication, written or by radio or television, which offers any security for sale or confirms \nthe sale of any security.” (An exception: brief notes advising the public of the availability of the formal \nprospectus.) The import of this definition is that any communication to the public about the offering of a \nsecurity is unlawful unless it contains the requisite information. \n \nThe SEC staff examines the registration statement and prospectus, and if they appear to be materially \nincomplete or inaccurate, the commission may suspend or refuse the effectiveness of the registration \nstatement until the deficiencies are corrected. Even after the securities have gone on sale, the agency has \nthe power to issue a stop order that halts trading in the stock. \n \nSection 5(c) of the act bars any person from making any sale of any security unless it is first registered. \nNevertheless, there are certain classes of exemptions from the registration requirement. Perhaps the most \nimportant of these is Section 4(3), which exempts “transactions by any person other than an issuer, \nunderwriter or dealer.” Section 4(3) also exempts most transactions of dealers. So the net is that trading \nin outstanding securities (the secondary market) is exempt from registration under the Securities Act of \n1933: you need not file a registration statement with the SEC every time you buy or sell securities through \na broker or dealer, for example. Other exemptions include the following: (1) private offerings to a limited \nnumber of persons or institutions who have access to the kind of information registration would disclose",

Recognize how the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has amended the 1934 act to increase corporate regulation, \ntransparency, and penalties. \n \n \nCorporations may be found liable if they engage in certain unlawful practices, several of which we explore \nin this section. \n \nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act \nInvestigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Watergate Special Prosecutor in \nthe early 1970s turned up evidence that hundreds of companies had misused corporate funds, mainly by \nbribing foreign officials to induce them to enter into contracts with or grant licenses to US companies. \nBecause revealing the bribes would normally be self-defeating and, in any event, could be expected to stir \nup immense criticism, companies paying bribes routinely hid the payments in various accounts. As a \nresult, one of many statutes enacted in the aftermath of Watergate, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977, was incorporated into the 1934 Securities Exchange \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n725 \nAct. The SEC’s legal interest in the matter is not premised on the morality of bribery but rather on the \nfalsity of the financial statements that are being filed. \n \nCongress’s response to abuses of financial reporting, the FCPA, was much broader than necessary to treat \nthe violations that were uncovered. The FCPA prohibits an issuer (i.e., any US business enterprise), a \nstockholder acting on behalf of an issuer, and “any officer, director, employee, or agent” of an issuer from \nusing either the mails or interstate commerce corruptly to offer, pay, or promise to pay anything of value \nto foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates if the purpose is to gain business by inducing \nthe foreign official to influence an act of the government to render a decision favorable to the US \ncorporation. \n \nBut not all payments are illegal. Under 1988 amendments to the FCPA, payments may be made to \nexpedite routine governmental actions, such as obtaining a visa. And payments are allowed if they are \nlawful under the written law of a foreign country.

We briefly \nconsider successor liability—whether a successor corporation, such as a corporation that purchases \nall of the assets of another corporation, is liable for debts, lawsuits, and other liabilities of the \npurchased corporation. We then turn to appraisal rights, which are a shareholder’s right to dissent \nfrom a corporate expansion. Next, we look at several aspects, such as jurisdiction and taxation, of \nforeign corporations—corporations that are incorporated in a state that is different from the one in \nwhich they do business. We conclude the chapter with dissolution of the corporation. \n \n18.1 Corporate Expansion \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVE \n \n1. Understand the four methods of corporate expansion: purchase of assets other than in the regular course \nof business, merger, consolidation, and purchase of stock in another corporation. \n \n \nIn popular usage, “merger” often is used to mean any type of expansion by which one corporation \nacquires part or all of another corporation. But in legal terms, merger is only one of four methods of \nachieving expansion other than by internal growth. \n \nPurchase of Assets \nOne method of corporate expansion is the purchase of assets of another corporation. At the most basic \nlevel, ABC Corporation wishes to expand, and the assets of XYZ Corporation are attractive to ABC. So ABC \npurchases the assets of XYZ, resulting in the expansion of ABC. After the purchase, XYZ may remain in \ncorporate form or may cease to exist, depending on how many of its assets were purchased by ABC. \n \nThere are several advantages to an asset purchase, most notably, that the acquiring corporation can pick \nwhat assets and liabilities (with certain limitations, discussed further on in this section) it wishes to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n747 \nacquire. Furthermore, certain transactions may avoid a shareholder vote. If the selling corporation does \nnot sell substantially all of its assets, then its shareholders may not get a vote to approve the sale. \n \nFor example, after several years of successful merchandising, a corporation formed by Bob, Carol, and Ted \n(BCT Bookstore, Inc.) has opened three branch stores around town and discovered its transportation \ncosts mounting. Inventory arrives in trucks operated by the Flying Truckman Co., Inc. The BCT \ncorporation concludes that the economics of delivery do not warrant purchasing a single truck dedicated \nto hauling books for its four stores alone. Then Bob learns that the owners of Flying Truckman might be \nwilling to part with their company because it has not been earning money lately. If BCT could reorganize \nFlying Truckman’s other routes, it could reduce its own shipping costs while making a profit on other lines \nof business. \n \nUnder the circumstances, the simplest and safest way to acquire Flying Truckman is by purchasing its \nassets. That way BCT would own the trucks and whatever routes it chooses, without taking upon itself the \nstigma of the association. It could drop the name Flying Truckman. \n \nIn most states, the board of directors of both the seller and the buyer must approve a transfer of assets. \nShareholders of the selling corporation must also consent by majority vote, but shareholders of the \nacquiring company need not be consulted, so Ted’s opposition can be effectively mooted; see Figure 18.1 \n\"Purchase of Assets\". (When inventory is sold in bulk, the acquiring company must also comply with the \nlaw governing bulk transfers.) By purchasing the assets—trucks, truck routes, and the trademark Flying \nTruckman (to prevent anyone else from using it)—the acquiring corporation can carry on the functions of \nthe acquired company without carrying on its business as such.

Thus when Arkansas sought to revoke the license of a Missouri \nconstruction company to do business within the state, the Supreme Court held that the state had acted \nunconstitutionally (violating Article III, Section 2, of the US Constitution) in conditioning the license on a \nwaiver of the right to remove a case from the state courts to the federal courts. [2] \n \nTypical Requirements for Foreign Corporations \nCertain preconditions for doing business are common to most states. Foreign corporations are required to \nobtain from the secretary of state a certificate of authority to conduct business. The foreign corporation \nalso must maintain a registered office with a registered agent who works there. The registered agent may \nbe served with all legal process, demands, or notices required by law to be served on the corporation. \nForeign corporations are generally granted every right and privilege enjoyed by domestic corporations. \n \nThese requirements must be met whenever the corporation transacts business within the state. As \nmentioned previously, some activities do not fall within the definition of transacting business and may \nbe carried on even if the foreign corporation has not obtained a certificate of authority. These include \nfiling or defending a lawsuit, holding meetings of directors or shareholders, maintaining bank accounts, \nmaintaining offices for the transfer of the company’s own securities, selling through independent \ncontractors, soliciting orders through agents or employees (but only if the orders become binding \ncontracts upon acceptance outside the state), creating or acquiring security interests in real or personal \nproperty, securing or collecting debts, transacting any business in interstate commerce, and “conducting \nan isolated transaction that is completed within 30 days and that is not one in the course of repeated \ntransactions of a like nature” (Revised Model Business Corporation Act, Section 15.01). \n \nPenalties for Failure to Comply with a Statute \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n757 \nA corporation may not sue in the state courts to enforce its rights until it obtains a certificate of authority. \nIt may defend any lawsuits brought against it, however. The state attorney general has authority to collect \ncivil penalties that vary from state to state. Other sanctions in various states include fines and penalties on \ntaxes owed; fines and imprisonment of corporate agents, directors, and officers; nullification of corporate \ncontracts; and personal liability on contracts by officers and directors. In some states, contracts made by a \ncorporation that has failed to qualify are void. \n \nJurisdiction over Foreign Corporations \nWhether corporations are subject to state court jurisdiction depends on the extent to which they are \noperating within the state. If the corporation is qualified to do business within the state and has a \ncertificate of authority or license, then state courts have jurisdiction and process may be served on the \ncorporation’s registered agent. If the corporation has failed to name an agent or is doing business without \na certificate, the plaintiff may serve the secretary of state on the corporation’s behalf. \n \nEven if the corporation is not transacting enough business within the state to be required to qualify for a \ncertificate or license, it may still be subject to suit in state courts under long-arm statutes. These laws \npermit state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a corporation that has sufficient contacts with \nthe state. \n \nThe major constitutional limitation on long-arm statutes is the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court \nupheld the validity of long-arm statutes applied to corporations in International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington. [3] But the long-arm statute will only be constitutionally valid where there are minimum \ncontacts—that is, for a state to exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign corporation, the foreign \ncorporation must have at least “minimum contacts” the state. That jurisdictional test is still applied many \nyears after the International Shoe decision was handed down. [4] Since International Shoe, the \nnationalization of commerce has given way to the internationalization of commerce. This change has \nresulted in difficult jurisdictional questions that involve conflicting policy considerations.

The \nbasic approach, illustrated in D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (see Section 18.4.2 \"Constitutional \nIssues Surrounding Taxation of a Foreign Corporation\"), is that a state can impose a tax on activities for \nwhich the state gives legal protection, so long as the tax does not unreasonably burden interstate \ncommerce. \n \nState taxation of corporate income raises special concerns. In the absence of ground rules, a company \ndoing business in many states could be liable for paying income tax to several different states on the basis \nof its total earnings. A company doing business in all fifty states, for example, would pay five times its \nearnings in income taxes if each state were to charge a 10 percent tax on those earnings. Obviously, such a \nresult would seriously burden interstate commerce. The courts have long held, therefore, that the states \nmay only tax that portion of the company’s earnings attributable to the business carried on in the state. To \ncompute the proportion of a company’s total earnings subject to tax within the state, most states have \nadopted a formula based on the local percentage of the company’s total sales, property, and payroll. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA foreign corporation is a company incorporated outside of the state in which it is doing business. States can \nplace reasonable limitations upon foreign corporations subject to constitutional requirements. A foreign \ncorporation must do something that is sufficient to rise to the level of transacting business within a state in \norder to fall under the jurisdiction of that state. These transactions must meet the minimum-contacts \nrequirement for jurisdiction under long-arm statutes.

Rptr. 574 (Cal. 1977) \n \nClaiming damages for injury from a defective ladder, plaintiff asserts strict tort liability against defendant \nAlad Corporation (Alad II) which neither manufactured nor sold the ladder but prior to plaintiff’s injury \nsucceeded to the business of the ladder’s manufacturer, the now dissolved “Alad Corporation” (Alad I), \nthrough a purchase of Alad I’s assets for an adequate cash consideration. Upon acquiring Alad I’s plant, \nequipment, inventory, trade name, and good will, Alad II continued to manufacture the same line of \nladders under the “Alad” name, using the same equipment, designs, and personnel, and soliciting Alad I’s \ncustomers through the same sales representatives with no outward indication of any change in the \nownership of the business. The trial court entered summary judgment for Alad II and plaintiff appeals.… \n \nOur discussion of the law starts with the rule ordinarily applied to the determination of whether a \ncorporation purchasing the principal assets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities. As \ntypically formulated, the rule states that the purchaser does not assume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) \nthere is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n764 \nmerger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) \nthe transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the seller’s \ndebts. \n \nIf this rule were determinative of Alad II’s liability to plaintiff it would require us to affirm the summary \njudgment. None of the rule’s four stated grounds for imposing liability on the purchasing corporation is \npresent here. There was no express or implied agreement to assume liability for injury from defective \nproducts previously manufactured by Alad I. Nor is there any indication or contention that the transaction \nwas prompted by any fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for Alad I’s debts. \n \nWith respect to the second stated ground for liability, the purchase of Alad I’s assets did not amount to a \nconsolidation or merger. This exception has been invoked where one corporation takes all of another’s \nassets without providing any consideration that could be made available to meet claims of the other’s \ncreditors or where the consideration consists wholly of shares of the purchaser’s stock which are promptly \ndistributed to the seller’s shareholders in conjunction with the seller’s liquidation. In the present case the \nsole consideration given for Alad I’s assets was cash in excess of $ 207,000. Of this amount Alad I was \npaid $ 70,000 when the assets were transferred and at the same time a promissory note was given to Alad \nI for almost $ 114,000. Shortly before the dissolution of Alad I the note was assigned to the Hamblys, Alad \nI’s principal stockholders, and thereafter the note was paid in full. The remainder of the consideration \nwent for closing expenses or was paid to the Hamblys for consulting services and their agreement not to \ncompete. There is no contention that this consideration was inadequate or that the cash and promissory \nnote given to Alad I were not included in the assets available to meet claims of Alad I’s creditors at the \ntime of dissolution. Hence the acquisition of Alad I’s assets was not in the nature of a merger or",

The Louisiana taxing scheme is fairly apportioned, for \nit provides a credit against its use tax for sales taxes that have been paid in other States. Holmes paid no \nsales tax for the catalogs where they were designed or printed; if it had, it would have been eligible for a \ncredit against the use tax exacted. Similarly, Louisiana imposed its use tax only on the 82% of the catalogs \ndistributed in-state; it did not attempt to tax that portion of the catalogs that went to out-of-state \ncustomers. \n \nThe Louisiana tax structure likewise does not discriminate against interstate commerce. The use tax is \ndesigned to compensate the State for revenue lost when residents purchase out-of-state goods for use \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n769 \nwithin the State. It is equal to the sales tax applicable to the same tangible personal property purchased \nin-state; in fact, both taxes are set forth in the same sections of the Louisiana statutes. \n \nComplete Auto requires that the tax be fairly related to benefits provided by the State, but that condition \nis also met here. Louisiana provides a number of services that facilitate Holmes’ sale of merchandise \nwithin the State: It provides fire and police protection for Holmes’ stores, runs mass transit and maintains \npublic roads which benefit Holmes’ customers, and supplies a number of other civic services from which \nHolmes profits. To be sure, many others in the State benefit from the same services; but that does not \nalter the fact that the use tax paid by Holmes, on catalogs designed to increase sales, is related to the \nadvantages provided by the State which aid Holmes’ business. \n \nFinally, we believe that Holmes’ distribution of its catalogs reflects a substantial nexus with Louisiana. To \nbegin with, Holmes’ contention that it lacked sufficient control over the catalogs’ distribution in Louisiana \nto be subject to the use tax verges on the nonsensical. Holmes ordered and paid for the catalogs and \nsupplied the list of customers to whom the catalogs were sent; any catalogs that could not be delivered \nwere returned to it. Holmes admits that it initiated the distribution to improve its sales and name \nrecognition among Louisiana residents. Holmes also has a significant presence in Louisiana, with 13 \nstores and over $100 million in annual sales in the State. The distribution of catalogs to approximately \n400,000 Louisiana customers was directly aimed at expanding and enhancing its Louisiana business. \nThere is “nexus” aplenty here. [Judgment affirmed.] \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1. What is the main constitutional issue in this case? \n2. What are the four prongs to test whether a tax violates the Constitution, as laid out in Complete Auto? \n3. Does this case hold for the proposition that a state may levy any tax upon a foreign corporation? \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n770 \n18.5 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nBeyond the normal operations of business, a corporation can expand in one of four ways: (1) purchase of \nassets, (2) merger, (3) consolidation, and (4) purchase of another corporation’s stock. \n \nA purchase of assets occurs when one corporation purchases some or all of the assets of another \ncorporation. When assets are purchased, the purchasing corporation is not generally liable for the debts of \nthe corporation whose assets were sold. There are several generally recognized exceptions, such as when \nthe asset purchase is fraudulent or to avoid creditors. Some states have added additional exceptions, such \nas in cases involving products liability. \n \nIn a merger, the acquired company is absorbed into the acquiring company and goes out of business. The \nacquiring corporation assumes the other company’s debts. Unless the articles of incorporation say \notherwise, a majority of directors and shareholders of both corporations must approve the merger. There",

But a holder can \nalso be someone unnamed whom the original parties did not contemplate by name—for example, the \nholder of a bearer note. \n \nHolder in Due Course \nA holder in due course is a special type of holder who, if certain requirements are met, acquires rights \nbeyond those possessed by the transferor (we alluded to this in describing the significance of Lorna Love’s \nmaking of a negotiable—as opposed to a nonnegotiable—instrument). We discuss the requirements for a \nholder in due course in Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\". \n \n \n \nAccommodation Party \nAn accommodation party is one who signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend her name to \nanother party to the instrument.

As a signatory, an accommodation party is always a surety \n(Chapter 23 \"Legal Aspects of Banking\"; a surety is one who guarantees payment if the primarily obligated \nparty fails to pay). The extent of the accommodation party’s liability to pay depends on whether she has \nadded language specifying her purposes in signing. Section 3-416 of the UCC distinguishes between a \nguaranty of payment and a guaranty of collection. An accommodation party who adds words such as \n“payment guaranteed” subjects herself to primary liability: she is guaranteeing that she will pay if the \nprincipal signatory fails to pay when the instrument is due. But if the accommodation party signs \n“collection guaranteed,” the holder must first sue the maker and win a court judgment. Only if the \njudgment is unsatisfied can the holder seek to collect from the accommodation party.

The draft is a three-party instrument whereby one person \n(drawer) directs a second (drawee) to pay money to the third (payee). Drafts may be sight drafts, payable on \nsight, or they may be time drafts, payable at a date specified on the draft. Checks are drafts drawn on banks. \nOther parties include indorser and indorsee, holder, holder in due course, and accommodation party. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Know what is required for an instrument to be negotiable. \n \n \nOverview \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n790 \nWhether or not a paper is negotiable is the first of our four major questions, and it is one that nonlawyers \nmust confront. Auditors, retailers, and financial institutions often handle notes and checks and usually \nmust make snap judgments about negotiability. Unless the required elements of Sections 3-103 and 3-104 \nof the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are met, the paper is not negotiable. Thus the paper meets the \nfollowing criteria: \n1. It must be in writing. \n2. It must be signed by the maker or drawer. \n3. It must be an unconditional promise or order to pay. \n4. It must be for a fixed amount in money. \n5. It must be payable on demand or at a definite time. \n6. It must be payable to order or bearer, unless it is a check. \n \nThis definition states the basic premise of a negotiable instrument: the holder must be able to ascertain all \nessential terms from the face of the instrument. \nAnalysis of Required Elements \nIn Writing \nUnder UCC Section 1-201, “written” or “writing” includes “printing, typewriting or any other intentional \nreduction to tangible form.” That definition is broad—so broad, in fact, that from time to time the \nnewspapers report checks written on material ranging from a girdle (an Ohio resident wanted to make his \ntax payment stretch) to granite. Since these are tangible materials, the checks meet the writing \nrequirement. The writing can be made in any medium: ink, pencil, or even spray paint, as was the case \nwith the granite check. Of course, there is a danger in using pencil or an ink that can be erased, since the \ndrawer might be liable for alterations. For example, if you write out in pencil a check for $10 and someone \nerases your figures and writes in $250, you may lose your right to protest when the bank cashes it. \n \nSigned by the Maker or Drawer \nSignature is not limited to the personal handwriting of one’s name. “Any symbol executed or adopted by a \nparty with present intention to authenticate a writing” will serve.

            "chunk": "In Money \nSection 1-201(24) of the UCC defines money as “a medium of exchange authorized or adopted by a \ndomestic or foreign government as a part of its currency.” As long as the medium of exchange was such at \nthe time the instrument was made, it is payable in money, even if the medium of exchange has been \nabolished at the time the instrument is due. Section 3-107 provides the following as to payment in foreign \ncurrency: “Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in \nforeign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using \nthe current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which \nthe instrument is paid.” \n \nPayable on Demand or at a Definite Time \nAn instrument that says it is payable on sight is payable on demand, as is one that states no time for \npayment. “Definite time” may be stated in several ways; it is not necessary to set out a specific date. For \nexample, a note might say that it is payable on or before a stated date, at a fixed period after the date, at a \nfixed period after sight, at a definite time subject to acceleration, or at a definite time subject to extension \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n793 \nat the option of the holder or automatically on or after the occurrence of a particular event. However, if \nthe only time fixed is on the occurrence of a contingent event, the time is not definite, even though the \nevent in fact has already occurred. An example of a valid acceleration clause is the following: “At the \noption of the holder, this note shall become immediately due and payable in the event that the maker fails \nto comply with any of the promises contained in this note or to perform any other obligation of the maker \nto the holder.” \n \nIs the note “Payable ten days after I give birth” negotiable? No, because the date the baby is due is \nuncertain. Is the note “Payable on January 1, but if the Yankees win the World Series, payable four days \nearlier” negotiable? Yes: this is a valid acceleration clause attached to a definite date. \nOne practical difference between a demand instrument and a time instrument is the date on which the \nstatute of limitations begins to run. (A statute of limitations is a limit on the time a creditor has to file a \nlawsuit to collect the debt.) Section 3-118(1) of the UCC says that a lawsuit to enforce payment at a definite \ntime “must be commenced within six years after the due date” (or the accelerated due date). For demand \npaper, an action must be brought “within six years after the demand.” \n \nPayable to Order or Bearer \nAn instrument payable to order is one that will be paid to a particular person or organization identifiable \nin advance. To be payable to order, the instrument must so state, as most ordinarily do, by placing the \nwords “payable to order of” before the name of the payee. An instrument may be payable to the order of \nthe maker, drawer, drawee, or someone else. It also may be payable to the order of two or more payees \n(together or in the alternative), to an estate, a trust, or a fund (in which case it is payable to the \nrepresentative, to an office or officer, or to a partnership or unincorporated association). Suppose a \nprinted form says that the instrument is payable both to order and to bearer. In that event, the instrument \nis payable only to order. However, if the words “to bearer” are handwritten or typewritten, then the \ninstrument can be payable either to order or to bearer. \n \nA negotiable instrument not payable to a particular person must be payable to bearer, meaning to any \nperson who presents it. To be payable to bearer, the instrument may say “payable to bearer” or “to the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n794 \norder of bearer.” It may also say “payable to John Doe or bearer.” Or it may be made payable to cash or \nthe order of cash. \n \nSection 3-104(c) of the UCC excepts checks from the requirement that the instrument be “payable to \nbearer or order.” Official Comment 2 to that section explains why checks are not required to have the \n“payable” wording: “Subsection (c) is based on the belief that it is good policy to treat checks, which are \npayment instruments, as negotiable instruments whether or not they contain the words ‘to the order of.’ \nThese words are almost always pre-printed on the check form.…Absence of the quoted words can easily be \noverlooked and should not affect the rights of holders who may pay money or give credit for a check \nwithout being aware that it is not in the conventional form.” \n \nAlso affecting this policy is the fact that almost all checks are now read by machines, not human beings. \nThere is no one to see that the printed form does not contain the special words, and the significance of the \nwords is recognized by very few people. In short, it doesn’t matter for checks. \n \nMissing and Ambiguous Terms \nThe rules just stated make up the conditions for negotiability. Dealing with two additional details—",

Know how a transfer becomes a negotiation payable to order or to bearer. \n \n \nDefinitions, Rights, and Liabilities \nTransfer means physical delivery of any instrument—negotiable or not—intending to pass title. Section \n3-203(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides that “an instrument is transferred when it is \ndelivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the \nright to enforce the instrument.” \n \nNegotiation and Holder \nSection 3-201(a) of the UCC defines negotiation as “a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or \ninvoluntary, of an instrument to a person who thereby becomes its holder if possession is obtained from a \nperson other than the issuer of the instrument.” A holder is defined in Section 1-201(2) as “a person who \nis in possession of an instrument drawn, issued, or indorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank” \n(“in blank” means that no indorsement is required for negotiation). The original issuing or making of an \ninstrument is not negotiation, though a holder can be the beneficiary of either a transfer or a negotiation. \nThe Official Comment to 3-201(a) is helpful: \n \nA person can become holder of an instrument when the instrument is issued to that person, or the \nstatus of holder can arise as the result of an event that occurs after issuance. “Negotiation” is the \nterm used in article 3 to describe this post-issuance event. Normally, negotiation occurs as the \nresult of a voluntary transfer of possession of an instrument by a holder to another person who \nbecomes the holder as a result of the transfer. Negotiation always requires a change in possession \nof the instrument because nobody can be a holder without possessing the instrument, either \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n812 \ndirectly or through an agent. But in some cases the transfer of possession is involuntary and in \nsome cases the person transferring possession is not a holder.…[S]ubsection (a) states that \nnegotiation can occur by an involuntary transfer of possession.

Despite this simple rule, the purchaser of the instrument may \nrequire an indorsement on some bearer paper anyway. You may have noticed that sometimes you are \nrequested to indorse your own check when you make it out to cash. That is because the indorsement \nincreases the liability of the indorser if the holder is unable to collect. Chung v. New York Racing \nAssociation (Section 20.4 \"Cases\") deals with issues involving bearer paper. \n \nFigure 20.1 Negotiation of Bearer Paper \n \n \nNegotiation of Instrument Payable to Order \nNegotiation is usually voluntary, and the issuer usually directs payment “to order”—that is, to someone’s \norder, originally the payee. Order paper is this negotiable instrument that by its term is payable to a \nspecified person or his assignee. If it is to continue its course through the channels of commerce, it must \nbe indorsed—signed, usually on the back—by the payee and passed on to the transferee. Continuing with \nthe example used in Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Rackets, Inc. (the payee) \nnegotiates Lorna Love’s check (Lorna is the issuer or drawer) drawn to the order of Rackets when an agent \nof Rackets “signs” the company’s name on the reverse of the check and passes it to the indorsee, such as \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n815 \nthe bank or someone to whom Rackets owed money. (A company’s signature is usually a rubber stamp for \nmere deposit, but an agent can sign the company name and direct the instrument elsewhere.) The \ntransferee is a holder (see Figure 20.2 \"Negotiation of Order Paper\"). Had Rackets neglected to indorse \nthe check, the transferee, though in physical possession, would not be a holder. Issues regarding \nindorsement are discussed in Section 20.2 \"Indorsements\". \n \nFigure 20.2 Negotiation of Order Paper \n \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nA transfer is the physical delivery of an instrument with the intention to pass title—the right to enforce it. A \nmere transferee stands in the transferor’s shoes and takes the instrument subject to all the claims and \ndefenses against paying it that burdened it when the transferor delivered it. Negotiation is a special type of \ntransfer—voluntary or involuntary—to a holder. A holder is a person who has an instrument drawn, issued, or \nindorsed to him or his order or to bearer or in blank. If the instrument is order paper, negotiation is \naccomplished by indorsement and delivery to the next holder; if it is bearer paper or blank paper, delivery \nalone accomplishes negotiation. Transferors incur two types of liability: those who sign the instrument are \ncontractually liable; those who sign or those who do not sign are liable to the transferee in warranty. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

Wachovia Bank, N.A. \n2006 WL 773020 (Penn. [Trial Court] 2006) \n \nAbramson, J. \n \nBackground \nThis is a subrogation action brought by the insurance carrier for plaintiff Victory Clothing, Inc. \n(“Victory”), to recover funds paid to Victory under an insurance policy. This matter arises out of thefts \nfrom Victory’s commercial checking account by its office manager and bookkeeper, Jeanette Lunny \n(“Lunny”). Lunny was employed by Victory for approximately twenty-four (24) years until she resigned in \nMay 2003. From August 2001 through May 2003, Lunny deposited approximately two hundred (200) \nchecks drawn on Victory’s corporate account totaling $188,273.00 into her personal checking account at \ndefendant Wachovia Bank (“Wachovia”). Lunny’s scheme called for engaging in “double forgeries” \n(discussed infra). Lunny would prepare the checks in the company’s computer system, and make the \nchecks payable to known vendors of Victory (e.g., Adidas, Sean John), to whom no money was actually \nowed. The checks were for dollar amounts that were consistent with the legitimate checks to those \nvendors. She would then forge the signature of Victory’s owner, Mark Rosenfeld (“Rosenfeld”), on the \nfront of the check, and then forge the indorsement of the unintended payee (Victory’s various vendors) on \nthe reverse side of the check. The unauthorized checks were drawn on Victory’s bank account at Hudson \nBank (the “drawee bank” or “payor bank”). After forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either \nindorsed the check with her name followed by her account number, or referenced her account number \nfollowing the forged indorsement. She then deposited the funds into her personal bank account at \nWachovia (the “depositary bank” or “collecting bank”). \n \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance of checks \nfor deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited ONLY into a non-\npersonal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n837 \nRosenfeld reviewed the bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. However, among other \nobservable irregularities, he failed to detect that Lunny had forged his signature on approximately two \nhundred (200) checks. Nor did he have a procedure to match checks to invoices. \nIn its Complaint, Victory asserted a claim against Wachovia pursuant to the Pennsylvania Commercial \nCode, [3-405]…[it] states, in relevant part: \n \nEmployer’s responsibility for fraudulent indorsement by employee \n \n(b) RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES.-For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a \nperson who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an \nemployer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the \nemployee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the \ninstrument, the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument",

Double Forgeries \nAs stated supra, this case involves a double forgery situation. This matter presents a question of first \nimpression in the Pennsylvania state courts, namely how should the loss be allocated in double forgery \nsituations. A double forgery occurs when the negotiable instrument contains both a forged maker’s [bank \ncustomer’s] signature and a forged indorsement. The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC” or “Code”) \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n838 \naddresses the allocation of liability in cases where either the maker’s signature is forged or where the \nindorsement of the payee or holder is forged. [Citation] (“the Code accords separate treatment to forged \ndrawer signatures…and forged indorsements”). However, the drafters of the UCC failed to specifically \naddress the allocation of liability in double forgery situations.…Consequently, the courts have been left to \ndetermine how liability should be allocated in a double forgery case.… \n \nII. The Effect of the UCC Revisions \nIn 1990, new revisions to Articles 3 and 4 of the UCC were implemented (the “revisions”).…The new \nrevisions made a major change in the area of double forgeries. Before the revisions, the case law was \nuniform in treating a double forgery case as a forged drawer’s signature case [only], with the loss falling \n[only] on the drawee bank. The revisions, however, changed this rule by shifting to a comparative fault \napproach. Under the revised version of the UCC, the loss in double forgery cases is allocated between the \ndepositary and drawee banks based on the extent that each contributed to the loss.… \n \nSpecifically, revised § 3-405 of the UCC, entitled “Employer’s Responsibility for Fraudulent Indorsement \nby Employee,” introduced the concept of comparative fault as between the employer of the dishonest \nemployee/embezzler and the bank(s). This is the section under which Victory sued Wachovia. Section 3-\n405(b) states, in relevant part: \n \nIf the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise \nordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss \nresulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to \nexercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. \n \nWachovia argues that this section is applicable only in cases of forged indorsements, and not in double \nforgery situations. However, at least one court has found that the new revisions have made section 3-405 \napply to double forgery situations. “Nothing in the [Revised UCC] statutory language indicates that, where \nthe signature of the drawer is forged…the drawer is otherwise precluded from seeking recovery from a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n839 \ndepositary bank under these sections” [Citation]…The Court finds the reasoning persuasive and holds \nthat…Victory can maintain its cause of action against Wachovia. \n \nIII. The Fictitious Payee Rule \nLunny made the fraudulent checks payable to actual vendors of Victory with the intention that the \nvendors not get paid. Wachovia therefore argues that Victory’s action against it should be barred by the \nfictitious payee rule under UCC 3-404 [which] states, in relevant part: \n \n(b) Fictitious Payee. If a person…does not intend the person identified as payee to have any \ninterest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, \nthe following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement:",

Therefore, [Wachovia argues] the loss should fall on the company whose \nemployee committed the fraud. \n \n…[However] under revised UCC §§ 3-404 and 3-405, the fictitious payee defense triggers principles of \ncomparative fault, so a depositary bank’s own negligence may be considered by the trier of \nfact.…Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, the fictitious payee defense does not help Wachovia in \nthis case. \n \n \n \nIV. Allocation of Liability \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n840 \nAs stated supra, comparative negligence applies in this case because of the revisions in the Code. In \ndetermining the liability of the parties, the Court has considered, inter alia [among other things], the \nfollowing factors: \n \n• \nAt the time of the fraud by Lunny, Wachovia’s policies and regulations regarding the acceptance \nof checks for deposit provided that “checks payable to a non-personal payee can be deposited \nONLY into a non-personal account with the same name.” [Emphasis in original] \n• \nApproximately two hundred (200) checks drawn on Victory’s corporate account were deposited \ninto Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. \n• \nThe first twenty-three (23) fraudulent checks were made payable to entities that were not readily \ndistinguishable as businesses, such as “Sean John.” The check dated December 17, 2001 was the \nfirst fraudulent check made payable to a payee that was clearly a business, specifically “Beverly \nHills Shoes, Inc.” \n• \nIn 2001, Victory had approximately seventeen (17) employees, including Lunny. \n• \nLunny had been a bookkeeper for Victory from approximately 1982 until she resigned in May \n2003. Rosenfeld never had any problems with Lunny’s bookkeeping before she resigned. \n• \nLunny exercised primary control over Victory’s bank accounts. \n• \nBetween 2001 and 2003, the checks that were generated to make payments to Victory’s vendors \nwere all computerized checks generated by Lunny. No other Victory employee, other than Lunny, \nknew how to generate the computerized checks, including Rosenfeld. \n• \nThe fraudulent checks were made payable to known vendors of Victory in amounts that were \nconsistent with previous legitimate checks to those vendors. \n• \nAfter forging the indorsement of the payee, Lunny either indorsed the check with her name \nfollowed by her account number, or referenced her account number following the forged \nindorsement. \n• \nAbout ten (10) out of approximately three hundred (300) checks each month were forged by \nLunny and deposited into her personal account. \n• \nRosenfeld reviewed his bank statements from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n841 \n• \nRosenfeld received copies of Victory’s cancelled checks from Hudson Bank on a monthly basis. \nHowever, the copies of the cancelled checks were not in their normal size; instead, they were \nsmaller, with six checks (front and back side) on each page. \n• \nThe forged indorsements were written out in longhand, i.e., Lunny’s own handwriting, rather \nthan a corporate stamped signature. \n• \nVictory did not match its invoices for each check at the end of each month. \n• \nAn outside accounting firm performed quarterly reviews of Victory’s bookkeeping records, and \nthen met with Rosenfeld. This review was not designed to pick up fraud or misappropriation. \n \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that Victory and Wachovia are comparatively negligent. \n \nWith regard to Wachovia’s negligence, it is clear that Wachovia was negligent in violating its own rules in \nrepeatedly depositing corporate checks into Lunny’s personal account at Wachovia. Standard commercial \nbank procedures dictate that a check made payable to a business be accepted only into a business \nchecking account with the same title as the business.

At issue is the deposit of a check with a typed statement on the back \ndirecting that a portion of the funds be paid to a third party. We affirm the trial court judgment. \n \nFacts \nOn July 13, 2001, the United States Treasury, through the Farm Service Agency, issued a check in the \namount of $17,420.00, made payable to Chad E. Gill. On the back of the check the following was typed: \nPAY TO THE ORDER OF RICHLAND STATE BANK FOR ISSUANCE OF A CASHIER’S CHECK \nPAYABLE TO WISNER ELEVATOR IN THE AMOUNT OF $13,200.50 AND PAY THE BALANCE \nTO CHAD GILL IN THE AMOUNT OF $4,219.50. \n \nOn July 23, 2001, the check was deposited into Gill’s checking account at Richland State Bank. Gill’s \nsignature is found on the back of the check below the typed paragraph. No cashier check to Wisner \nElevator was issued; instead the entire amount was deposited into Gill’s checking account as per Gill’s \ndeposit ticket. \n \n…On May 28, 2002, Wisner filed suit against the bank, claiming that its failure to apply the funds as per \nthe restrictive indorsement constituted a conversion of the portion of the check due to Wisner under UCC \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n844 \n3-206(c)(2) [that a depositary bank converts an instrument if it pays out on an indorsement “indicating a \npurpose of having the instrument collected for the indorser or for a particular account”]. \n \n[The bank] asserted that the indorsement on the back of the check was a conditional indorsement and \nineffective under 3-206(b), [which states:] \n \nAn indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect \nthe right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it \nfor value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person \nare not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled. \n \n…[T]he bank asserts the fault of the United States Treasury…, in failing to make the check payable to both \nGill and Wisner. To the extent that the indorsement was conditional, the bank contends that it was \nunenforceable; to the extent that it was restrictive, it maintains that the restrictions were waived by the \nindorser when he deposited the full amount of the check into his own checking account. \n \nWisner…[stated that it] was owed $13,200.50 by Gill for seeds, chemicals, crop supplies and agricultural \nseed technology fees. [It] further stated that Gill never paid the $13,200.50 he owed and that Wisner did \nnot receive a cashier’s check issued in that amount by Richland State Bank.…According to [the bank \nteller], Gill asked to deposit the entire amount in his account. She further stated that the bank was \nunaware that the indorsement was written by someone other than Gill. \n \n…The court found that the typed indorsement placed on the check was the indorsement of the maker, not \nGill. However, when Gill signed below the indorsement, he made it his own indorsement. The court \nconcluded that Gill had the legal power and authority to verbally instruct that the entire proceeds be \ndeposited into his account. The court stated that as long as the indorsement was his own, whether it was \nrestrictive or conditional, Gill had the power to ignore it, strike it out or give contrary instructions. The \ncourt further concluded that the bank acted properly when it followed the verbal instructions given by Gill \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n845 \nto the teller and the written instructions on his deposit slip to deposit the entire proceeds into Gill’s \naccount. Consequently, the court gave summary judgment in favor of the bank. Wisner appeals.… \n \nDiscussion \nWisner contends that the trial court erred in holding that the bank could disregard what Wisner \ncharacterizes as a special and restrictive indorsement on the back of the check. It claims that under UCC \n3-206, the amount paid by the bank had to be “applied consistently with” the indorsement and that the \nbank’s failure to comply with the indorsement made it liable to Wisner. According to Wisner, Gill was not \nentitled to deposit the amount due to Wisner by virtue of his own special indorsement and the bank \nconverted the check under 3-420 by crediting the full amount to Gill’s account. \n \nThe bank argues that the indorsement was conditional and thus could be ignored pursuant to 3-206(b). It \nalso asserts that nothing on the check indicated that the indorsement was written by someone other than \nGill. Since the check was made payable to Gill, the indorsement was not necessary to his title and could be \nignored, struck out or simply waived. The bank also claims that Wisner had no ownership interest in the \ncheck, did not receive delivery of the check, and had no claim for conversion under 3-420. \n \nWe agree with the bank that the true problem in this case is the failure of the government to issue the",

In some states, for instance, an infant who misrepresents his age is estopped from asserting infancy \nas a defense to a breach of contract. In those states, infancy would not be available as a defense against the \neffort of an HDC to collect. \n \nFraudulent Alteration \nUnder Section 3-407 of the UCC, “fraudulent alteration” means either (1) an unauthorized change in an \ninstrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party or (2) an unauthorized \naddition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a \nparty. An alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration \nunless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. But a nonfraudulent alteration—for \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n865 \nexample, filling in an omitted date or giving the obligor the benefit of a lower interest rate—does not \ndischarge the obligor. In any case, the person paying or taking the instrument may pay or collect \n“according to its original terms, or in the case of an incomplete instrument that is altered by unauthorized \ncompletion, according to its terms as completed. If blanks are filled or an incomplete instrument is \notherwise completed, subsection (c) places the loss upon the party who left the instrument incomplete by \npermitting enforcement in its completed form. This result is intended even though the instrument was \nstolen from the issuer and completed after the theft.” A moral here: don’t leave instruments lying around \nwith blanks that could be filled in. \n \nVoid Contract \nA void contract is distinguished from a voidable contract; only the former is a real defense. \n \nFraud in the Execution \nYou may recall that this is the rather unusual situation in which a person is tricked into signing a \ndocument. Able holds out a piece of paper for her boss and points to the signature line, saying, “This is a \nreceipt for goods we received a little while ago.” Baker signs it. It is not a receipt; it’s the signature line on \na promissory note. Able has committed fraud in the execution, and the note is void. \n \nDischarge of Which the Holder Has Notice \nIf the holder knows that the paper—a note, say—has already been paid, she cannot enforce it. That’s a \ngood reason to take back any note you have made from the person who presents it to you for payment. \n \nConsumer Transactions and Holders in Due Course \nThe holder-in-due-course doctrine often worked considerable hardship on the consumer, usually as the \nmaker of an installment note. \n \nFor example, a number of students are approached by a gym owner who induces them to sign one-year \npromissory notes for $150 for a one-year gym membership. The owner says, “I know that right now the \nequipment in the gym is pretty rudimentary, but then, too, $150 is about half what you’d pay at the YMCA \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n866 \nor Gold’s Gym. And the thing is, as we get more customers signing up, we’re going to use the money to \ninvest in new equipment. So within several months we’ll have a fully equipped facility for your use.” \nSeveral students sign the notes, which the owner sells to a factor (one that lends money to another, \ntaking back a negotiable instrument as security, usually at about a 20 percent discount). The factor takes \nas an apparent HDC, but the gym idea doesn’t work and the owner declares bankruptcy. If this were a \ncommercial transaction, the makers (the students) would still owe on the notes even if there was, as here, \na complete failure of consideration (called “paying on a dead horse”). But the students don’t have to pay. \n \nWhether the gym owner here committed fraud is uncertain, but the holder-in-due-course doctrine did \noften work to promote fraud. Courts frequently saw cases brought by credit companies (factors) against \nconsumers who bought machines that did not work and services that did not live up to their promises. The \nancient concept of an HDC did not square with the realities of modern commerce, in which instruments \nby the millions are negotiated for uncompleted transactions. The finance company that bought such \ncommercial paper could never have honestly claimed (in the sociological sense) to be wholly ignorant that \nmany makers will have claims against their payees (though they could and did make the claim in the legal \nsense). \n \nActing to curb abuses, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1976 promulgated a trade regulation rule \nthat in effect abolished the holder-in-due-course rule for consumer credit transactions. Under the FTC \nrule titled “Preservation of Consumers’ Claims and Defenses,” [3] the creditor becomes a mere holder and \nstands in the shoes of the seller, subject to all claims and defenses that the debtor could assert against the \nseller. Specifically, the rule requires the seller to provide notice in any consumer credit contract that the",

App. 1999) \n \nLytton, J. \n \nFacts \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n869 \nOmni purchased some grain from Country Grain, and on February 2, 1996, it issued two checks, totaling \n$75,000, to Country Grain. Country Grain, in turn, endorsed the checks over to Carter as a retainer for \nfuture legal services. Carter deposited the checks on February 5; Country Grain failed the next day. On \nFebruary 8, Carter was notified that Omni had stopped payment on the checks. Carter subsequently filed \na complaint against Omni…alleging that it was entitled to the proceeds of the checks, plus pre-judgment \ninterest, as a holder in due course.…[Carter moved for summary judgment; the motion was denied.] \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nCarter argues that its motion for summary judgment should have been granted because, as a holder in due \ncourse, it has the right to recover on the checks from the drawer, Omni. \n \nThe Illinois Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) defines a holder in due course as: \n“the holder of an instrument if: \n \n(1) the instrument when issued does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is \nnot otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity, and (2) the \nholder took the instrument (i) for value,… \n \nSection 3-303(a) of the UCC also states that: \n \n(a) “An instrument is issued or transferred for value if: (1) the instrument is issued or transferred \nfor a promise of performance, to the extent that the promise has been performed * * *.” \n(emphasis added) \n \nCarter contends that in Illinois a contract for future legal services should be treated differently than other \nexecutory contracts. It contends that when the attorney-client relationship is created by payment of a fee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n870 \nor retainer, the contract is no longer executory. Thus, Carter would achieve holder in due course status. \nWe are not persuaded. \n \nA retainer is the act of a client employing an attorney; it also denotes the fee paid by the client when he \nretains the attorney to act for him. [Citation] We have found no Illinois cases construing section 3-303(a) \nas it relates to a promise to perform future legal services under a retainer. The general rule, however, is \nthat “an executory promise is not value.” [Citation] “[T]he promise does not rise to the level of ‘value’ in \nthe commercial paper market until it is actually performed.” [Citation] \n \nThe UCC comment to section 303 gives the following example: \n \n“Case # 2. X issues a check to Y in consideration of Y’s promise to perform services in the future. Although \nthe executory promise is consideration for issuance of the check it is value only to the extent the promise \nis performed. \n \nWe have found no exceptions to these principles for retainers. Indeed, courts in other jurisdictions \ninterpreting similar language under section 3-303 have held that attorneys may be holders in due course \nonly to the extent that they have actually performed legal services prior to acquiring a negotiable \ninstrument. See [Citations: Pennsylvania, Florida, Massachusetts]. We agree. \n \nThis retainer was a contract for future legal services. Under section 3-303(a)(1), it was a “promise of \nperformance,” not yet performed. Thus, no value was received, and Carter is not a holder in due course. \n \nFurthermore, in this case, no evidence was presented in the trial court that Carter performed any legal \nservices for Country Grain prior to receiving the checks. Without an evidentiary basis for finding that \nCarter received the checks for services performed, the trial court correctly found that Carter failed to \nprove that it was a holder in due course. [Citations] \n \nConclusion \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n871 \nBecause we have decided that Carter did not take the checks for value under section 3-303(a) of the UCC, \nwe need not address its other arguments. \n \nThe judgment of the circuit court of Peoria County is affirmed. \n \nHoldridge, J., dissenting. \nI respectfully dissent. In a contractual relationship between attorney and client, the payment of a fee or \nretainer creates the relationship, and once that relationship is created the contract is no longer executory. \n[Citation] Carter’s agreement to enter into an attorney-client relationship with Country Grain was the \nvalue exchanged for the checks endorsed over to the firm. Thus, the general rule cited by the majority that \n“an executory promise is not value” does not apply to the case at bar. On that basis I would hold that the \ntrial court erred in determining that Carter was not entitled to the check proceeds and I therefore dissent. \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \n \n1.

[Citation] Under that standard, absent fraudulent behavior, an \notherwise innocent party was assumed to have acted in good faith. The “honesty in fact” requirement, also \nknown as the “pure heart and empty head” doctrine, is a subjective test under which a holder had to \nsubjectively believe he was negotiating an instrument in good faith for him to become a holder in due \ncourse. Maine [Citation, 1999]. \n \nIn 1994, however, the Ohio legislature amended the definition of “good faith” to include not only the \nsubjective “honesty in fact” test, but also an objective test: “the observance of reasonable commercial \nstandards of fair dealing.” Ohio UCC 1-201(20). A holder in due course must now satisfy both a subjective \nand an objective test of good faith. What constitutes “reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing” for \nparties claiming holder-in-due-course status, however, has not heretofore been defined in the state of \nOhio. \n \nIn support of his contention that Buckeye is not a holder in due course, Sheth cites a decision from the \nSupreme Court of Maine, [referred to above] in which the court provided clarification with respect to the \nobjective prong of the “good faith” analysis: \n \n“The fact finder must therefore determine, first, whether the conduct of the holder comported with \nindustry or ‘commercial’ standards applicable to the transaction and second, whether those \nstandards were reasonable standards intended to result in fair dealing. Each of those \ndeterminations must be made in the context of the specific transaction at hand. If the fact finder’s \nconclusion on each point is ‘yes,’ the holder will be determined to have acted in good faith even if, \nin the individual transaction at issue, the result appears unreasonable. Thus, a holder may be \naccorded holder in due course where it acts pursuant to those reasonable commercial standards \nof fair dealing—even if it is negligent—but may lose that status, even where it complies with \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n875 \ncommercial standards, if those standards are not reasonably related to achieving fair dealing.” \n[Citation] \n \nCheck cashing is an unlicensed and unregulated business in Ohio. [Citation] Thus, there are no concrete \ncommercial standards by which check-cashing businesses must operate. Moreover, Buckeye argues that \nits own internal operating policies do not require that it verify the availability of funds, nor does Buckeye \napparently have any guidelines with respect to the acceptance of postdated checks. Buckeye asserts that \ncashing a postdated check does not prevent a holder from obtaining holder-in-due-course status and cites \nseveral cases in support of this contention. All of the cases cited by Buckeye, however, were decided prior \nto the UCC’s addition of the objective prong to the definition of “good faith.” \n \nUnder a purely subjective “honesty in fact” analysis, it is clear that Buckeye accepted the check from Camp \nin good faith and would therefore achieve holder-in-due-course status. When the objective prong of the \ngood faith test is applied, however, we find that Buckeye did not conduct itself in a commercially \nreasonable manner. While not going so far as to say that cashing a postdated check prevents a holder from \nobtaining holder-in-due-course status in every instance, the presentation of a postdated check should put \nthe check cashing entity on notice that the check might not be good.

Mr. Hauser reviewed the checks, ascertained that the checks were \ncounterfeits and contacted the Raritan Borough and Hillsborough Police Departments. Mr. Hauser \nconcluded that the checks were counterfeits because none of the payees were employees of Hauser Co., \nand because he did not write the checks or authorize anyone to sign those checks on his behalf. At that \ntime, Hauser Co. employed Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Each company swore that it assigned the checks to plaintiff in exchange for \nconsideration received from plaintiff.

Moreover, pursuant to section 3-403(a)’s \nrequirement that the transfer must have been made for the purpose of giving the transferee the right to \nenforce the instrument, the assignment agreements expressly provided plaintiff with that right, stating \nthat “all payments [assignor] may receive from any of the referenced Debtors…shall be the exclusive \nproperty of [assignee].” Again, Hauser Co. does not dispute any facts relating to the assignment of the \nchecks to plaintiff. \n \nHauser Co. contends, instead, that the checks are per se invalid because they were fraudulent and \nunauthorized.

This section states a person is \nnot a holder in due course if the instrument bears “apparent evidence of forgery or alteration” or is \notherwise “so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity.” \n \nIn order to preclude liability from a holder in due course under section 3-302, it must be apparent on the \nface of the instrument that it is fraudulent. The trial court specifically found that Hauser Co. had provided \nno such evidence, stating that Hauser Co. had failed to show that there was anything about the \nappearance of the checks to place the check cashing company on notice that any check was not valid. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n881 \nSpecifically, with respect to Hauser Co.’s facsimile signature on the checks, the court stated that the \nsignature was identical to Hauser Co.’s authorized facsimile signature. Moreover, each of the check \ncashing companies certified that they had no knowledge that the signatures on the checks were fraudulent \nor that there were any claims or defenses to enforcement of the checks. Hence, the trial court’s conclusion \nthat there was no apparent evidence of invalidity was not an abuse of discretion and was based on a \nreasonable reading of the record. \n \nTo be sure, section 3-308(a) does shift the burden of establishing the validity of the signature to the \nplaintiff, but only if the defendant specifically denies the signature’s validity in the pleadings. The section \nstates: \n \nIn an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each \nsignature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity \nof a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person \nclaiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action \nis to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time \nof trial of the issue of validity of the signature.",

How parties are discharged from liability on commercial paper \n \n \nIn Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\", Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial \nPaper\", and Chapter 21 \"Holder in Due Course and Defenses\", we focused on the methods and \nconsequences of negotiating commercial paper when all the proper steps are followed.

As a result, this third party is entitled to collect from the maker, unless the latter has a \nreal defense. \n \nIn this chapter, we begin by examining a question especially important to management: personal \nliability for signing company notes and checks. Then we look at the two general types of liability—\ncontract and warranty—introduced in Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\". We conclude \nthe chapter by reviewing the ways in which parties are discharged from liability. \n \n \n \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n889 \n \n \n \n22.1 Liability Imposed by Signature: Agents, Authorized and \nUnauthorized \n \nLEARNING OBJECTIVES \n \n1. Recognize what a signature is under Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. \n2. Understand how a person’s signature on an instrument affects liability if the person is an agent, or a \npurported agent, for another. \n \n \nThe liability of an agent who signs commercial paper is one of the most frequently litigated issues in this \narea of law. For example, Igor is an agent (treasurer) of Frank N. Stein, Inc. Igor signs a note showing that \nthe corporation has borrowed $50,000 from First Bank. The company later becomes bankrupt. The \nquestion: Is Igor personally liable on the note? The unhappy treasurer might be sued by the bank—the \nimmediate party with whom he dealt—or by a third party to whom the note was transferred (see Figure \n22.1 \"Signature by Representative\"). \n \nFigure 22.1 Signature by Representative \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n890 \n \nThere are two possibilities regarding an agent who signs commercial paper: the agent was authorized to \ndo so, or the agent was not authorized to do so. First, though, what is a signature? \n \nA “Signature” under the Uniform Commercial Code \nSection 3-401 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides fairly straightforwardly that “a signature \ncan be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including \nany trade or assumed name, or by any word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with the \npresent intention to authenticate a writing.” \n \nLiability of an Agent Who Has Authority to Sign \nAgents often sign instruments on behalf of their principals, and—of course—because a corporation’s \nexistence is a legal fiction (you can’t go up and shake hands with General Motors), corporations can only \nact through their agents. \n \nThe General Rule \nSection 3-402(a) of the UCC provides that a person acting (or purporting to act) as an agent who signs an \ninstrument binds the principal to the same extent that the principal would be bound if the signature were \non a simple contract. The drafters of the UCC here punt to the common law of agency: if, under agency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n891 \nlaw, the principal would be bound by the act of the agent, the signature is the authorized signature of the \nprincipal. And the general rule in agency law is that the agent is not liable if he signs his own name and \nmakes clear he is doing so as an agent. In our example, Igor should sign as follows: “Frank N. Stein, Inc., \nby Igor, Agent.” Now it is clear under agency law that the corporation is liable and Igor is not. [1] Good job, \nIgor. \n \nIncorrect Signatures \nThe problems arise where the agent, although authorized, signs in an incorrect way. There are three \npossibilities: (1) the agent signs only his own name—“Igor”; (2) the agent signs both names but without \nindication of any agency—“Frank N. Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.”",

Stein, Inc., / Igor” (the signature is ambiguous—are both parties to be \nliable, or is Igor merely an agent?); (3) the agent signs as agent but doesn’t identify the principal—“Igor, \nAgent.” \n \nThe UCC provides that in each case, the agent is liable to a holder in due course (HDC) who took the \ninstrument without notice that the agent wasn’t intended to be liable on the instrument. As to any other \nperson (holder or transferee), the agent is liable unless she proves that the original parties to the \ninstrument did not intend her to be liable on it. Section 3-402(c) says that, as to a check, if an agent signs \nhis name without indicating agency status but the check has the principal’s identification on it (that would \nbe in the upper left corner), the authorized agent is not liable. \n \nLiability of an “Agent” Who Has No Authority to Sign \nA person who has no authority to sign an instrument cannot really be an “agent” because by definition an \nagent is a person or entity authorized to act on behalf of and under the control of another in dealing with \nthird parties. Nevertheless, unauthorized persons not infrequently purport to act as agents: either they are \nmistaken or they are crooks. Are their signatures binding on the “principal”? \n \nThe General Rule \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n892 \nAn unauthorized signature is not binding; it is—as the UCC puts it—“ineffective except as the signature of \nthe unauthorized signer.” [2] So if Crook signs a Frank N. Stein, Inc., check with the name “Igor,” the only \nperson liable on the check is Crook. \n \nThe Exceptions \nThere are two exceptions. Section 4-403(a) of the UCC provides that an unauthorized signature may be \nratified by the principal, and Section 3-406 says that if negligence contributed to an instrument’s \nalteration or forgery, the negligent person cannot assert lack of authority against an HDC or a person who \nin good faith pays or takes the instrument for value or for collection. This is the situation where Principal \nleaves the rubber signature stamp lying about and Crook makes mischief with it, making out a check to \nPayee using the stamp. But if Payee herself failed to exercise reasonable care in taking a suspicious \ninstrument, both Principal and Payee could be liable, based on comparative negligence principles. [3] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nUnder the UCC, a “signature” is any writing or mark used by a person to indicate that a writing is authentic. \nAgents often sign on behalf of principals, and when the authorized agent makes clear that she is so signing—\nby naming the principal and signing her name as “agent”—the principal is liable, not the agent. But when the \nagent signs incorrectly, the UCC says, in general, that the agent is personally liable to an HDC who takes the \npaper without notice that the agent is not intended to be liable. Unauthorized signatures (forgeries) are \nineffective as to the principal: they are effective as the forger’s signature, unless the principal or the person \npaying on the instrument has been negligent in contributing to, or in failing to notice, the forgery, in which \ncase comparative negligence principles are applied. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Able signs his name on a note with an entirely illegible squiggle. Is that a valid signature? \n2. Under what circumstances is an agent clearly not personally liable on an instrument? \n3.

Usually, notice of dishonor is given when the instrument is returned with a \nstamp (“NSF”—the dreaded “nonsufficient funds”), a ticket, or a memo. \n \nSuppose—you’ll want to graph this out—Ann signs a note payable to Betty, who indorses it to Carl, who in \nturn indorses it to Darlene. Darlene indorses it to Earl, who presents it to Ann for payment. Ann refuses. \nAnn is the only primary party, so if Earl is to be paid he must give notice of dishonor to one or more of the \nsecondary parties, in this case, the indorsers. He knows that Darlene is rich, so he notifies only Darlene. \nHe may collect from Darlene but not from the others. If Darlene wishes to be reimbursed, she may notify \nBetty (the payee) and Carl (a prior indorser). If she fails to notify either of them, she will have no recourse. \nIf she notifies both, she may recover from either. Carl in turn may collect from Betty, because Betty \nalready will have been notified. If Darlene notifies only Carl, then she may collect only from him, but he \nmust notify Betty or he cannot be reimbursed. Suppose Earl notified only Betty. Then Carl and Darlene \nare discharged. Why? Earl cannot proceed against them because he did not notify them. Betty cannot \nproceed against them because they indorsed subsequent to her and therefore were not contractually \nobligated to her. However, if, mistakenly believing that she could collect from either Carl or Darlene, Betty \ngave each notice within the time allowed to Earl, then he would be entitled to collect from one of them if \nBetty failed to pay, because they would have received notice. It is not necessary to receive notice from one \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n898 \nto whom you are liable; Section 3-503(b) says that notice may be given by any person, so that notice \noperates for the benefit of all others who have rights against the obligor. \n \nThere are some deadlines for giving notice: on an instrument taken for collection, a bank must give notice \nbefore midnight on the next banking day following the day on which it receives notice of dishonor; a \nnonbank must give notice within thirty days after the day it received notice; and in all other situations, the \ndeadline is thirty days after the day dishonor occurred. [12] \n \nWaived or Excused Conditions \nPresentment and notice of dishonor have been discussed as conditions precedent for imposing liability \nupon secondarily liable parties (again, drawers and indorsers). But the UCC provides circumstances in \nwhich such conditions may be waived or excused. \n \nPresentment Waived or Excused \nUnder UCC Section 3-504(a), presentment is excused if (1) the creditor cannot with reasonable diligence \npresent the instrument; (2) the maker or acceptor has repudiated the obligation to pay, is dead, or is in \ninsolvency proceedings; (3) no presentment is necessary by the instrument’s terms; (4) the drawer or \nindorsers waived presentment; (5) the drawer instructed the drawee not to pay or accept; or (6) the \ndrawee was not obligated to the drawer to pay the draft. \n \nNotice of Dishonor Excused \nNotice of dishonor is not required if (1) the instrument’s terms do not require it or (2) the debtor waived \nthe notice of dishonor. Moreover, a waiver of presentment is also a waiver of notice of dishonor. Delay in \ngiving the notice is excused, too, if it is caused by circumstances beyond the control of the person giving \nnotice and she exercised reasonable diligence when the cause of delay stopped. [13] \n \nIn fact, in real life, presentment and notice of dishonor don’t happen very often, at least as to notes. Going \nback to presentment for a minute: the UCC provides that the “party to whom presentment is made [the \ndebtor] may require exhibition of the instrument,…reasonable identification of the person demanding \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n899 \npayment,…[and] a signed receipt [from the creditor (among other things)]” (Section 3-501). This all \nmakes sense: for example, certainly the prudent contractor paying on a note for his bulldozer wants to \nmake sure the creditor actually still has the note (hasn’t negotiated it to a third party) and is the correct \nperson to pay, and getting a signed receipt when you pay for something is always a good idea. \n“Presentment” here is listed as a condition of liability, but in fact, most of the time there is no \npresentment at all: \n \n[I]t’s a fantasy. Every month millions of homeowners make payments on the notes that they \nsigned when they borrowed money to buy their houses. Millions of college graduates similarly \nmake payments on their student loan notes. And millions of drivers and boaters pay down the \nnotes that they signed when they borrowed money to purchase automobiles or vessels.

Every month millions of homeowners make payments on the notes that they \nsigned when they borrowed money to buy their houses. Millions of college graduates similarly \nmake payments on their student loan notes. And millions of drivers and boaters pay down the \nnotes that they signed when they borrowed money to purchase automobiles or vessels. [Probably] \nnone of these borrowers sees the notes that they are paying. There is no “exhibition” of the \ninstruments as section 3-501 [puts it]. There is no showing of identification. In some cases…there \nis no signing of a receipt for payment. Instead, each month, the borrowers simply mail a check to \nan address that they have been given. [14] \n \nThe Official Comment to UCC Section 5-502 says about the same thing: \n \nIn the great majority of cases presentment and notice of dishonor are waived with respect to \nnotes.

Understand that independent of contract liability, parties to negotiable instruments incur warranty liability. \n2. Know what warranties a person makes when she transfers an instrument. \n3. Know what warranties a person makes when he presents an instrument for payment or acceptance. \n4. Understand what happens if a bank pays or accepts a check by mistake. \n \n \nOverview of Warranty Liability \nWe discussed the contract liability of primary and secondary parties, which applies to those who sign the \ninstrument. Liability arises a second way, too—by warranty. A negotiable instrument is a type of property \nthat is sold and bought, just the way an automobile is, or a toaster. If you buy a car, you generally expect \nthat it will, more or less, work the way cars are supposed to work—that’s the implied warranty of \nmerchantability. Similarly, when an instrument is transferred from A to B for consideration, the \ntransferee (B) expects that the instrument will work the way such instruments are supposed to work. If A \ntransfers to B a promissory note made by Maker, B figures that when the time is right, she can go to \nMaker and get paid on the note. So A makes some implied warranties to B—transfer warranties. And \nwhen B presents the instrument to Maker for payment, Maker assumes that B as the indorsee from A is \nentitled to payment, that the signatures are genuine, and the like. So B makes some implied warranties to",

The reason \npresentment warranties 2 and 3 don’t apply to makers and drawers (they apply to drawees) is because \nmakers and drawers are going to know their own signatures and the terms of the instruments; indorsers \nalready warranted the wholesomeness of their transfer (transfer warranties), and acceptors should \nexamine the instruments when they accept them. \n \n \nPayment by Mistake \nSometimes a drawee pays a draft (most familiarly, again, a bank pays a check) or accepts a draft by \nmistake. The UCC says that if the mistake was in thinking that there was no stop-payment order on it \n(when there was), or that the drawer’s signature was authorized (when it was not), or that there were \nsufficient funds in the drawer’s account to pay it (when there were not), “the drawee may recover the \namount paid…or in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.” [6]Except—and it’s a big \nexception—such a recovery of funds does not apply “against a person who took the instrument in good \nfaith and for value.” [7] The drawee in that case would have to go after the forger, the unauthorized signer, \nor, in the case of insufficient funds, the drawer. Example: Able draws a check to Baker. Baker deposits the \ncheck in her bank account, and Able’s bank mistakenly pays it even though Able doesn’t have enough \nmoney in his account to cover it. Able’s bank cannot get the money back from Baker: it has to go after \nAble.

However, discharge does not operate if the payment is made in bad faith to one who \nunlawfully obtained the instrument (and UCC Section 3-602(b) lists two other exceptions). \n \n \n \nDischarge by Tender \nA person who tenders full payment to a holder on or after the date due discharges any subsequent liability",

According to Petitioner, having \nestablished that under his reading of § 3-409(a) the Bank accepted the check, Petitioner advances that the \nBank is obliged to pay him, pursuant to § 3-413(a)…Petitioner extends his line of reasoning by arguing \nthat the actions of the Bank amounted to a conversion under § 3-420,…Petitioner argues that because the \nBank accepted the check, an act which, according to Petitioner, discharged the drawer, he no longer had \nenforceable rights in the check and only had a right to the proceeds. Petitioner’s position is that the Bank \nexercised unauthorized dominion and control over the proceeds of the check to the complete exclusion of \nthe Petitioner after the Bank accepted the check and refused to distribute the proceeds, counted out by the \nteller, to him. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n919 \n \nWe turn to the Bank’s obligations, or lack thereof, with regard to the presentment of a check by someone \nnot its customer. Bank argues, correctly, that it had no duty to the Petitioner, a non-customer and a \nstranger to the Bank, and that nothing in the Code allows Petitioner to force Bank of America to act as a \ndepository bank… \n \nAbsent a special relationship, a non-customer has no claim against a bank for refusing to honor a \npresented check. [Citations] This is made clear by § 3-408, which states: \n \nA check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the \ndrawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until the drawee \naccepts it. \n \nOnce a bank accepts a check, under § 3-409, it is obliged to pay on the check under § 3-413. Thus, the \nrelevant question in terms of any rights Petitioner had against the Bank [regarding presentment] turns \nnot on the reasonableness of the thumbprint identification, but rather upon whether the Bank accepted \nthe check when presented as defined by § 3-409. As will be seen infra [below] the question of the \nthumbprint identification is relevant only to the issue of whether the Bank’s refusal to pay the instrument \nconstituted dishonor under § 3-502, a determination which has no impact in terms of any duty allegedly \nowed by the Bank to the Petitioner. \n \nThe statute clearly states that acceptance becomes effective when the presenter is notified of that fact. The \nfacts demonstrate that at no time did the teller notify Petitioner that the Bank would pay on the check. \nRather, the facts show that: \n[T]he check was given back to [Petitioner] by the teller so that he could put his thumbprint \nsignature on it, not to notify or give him rights on the purported acceptance. After appellant \ndeclined to put his thumbprint signature on the check, he was informed by both the teller and the \nbranch manager that it was against bank policy to honor the check without a thumbprint \nsignature. Indignant, [Petitioner] walked out of the bank with the check. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n920 \n \nAs the intermediate appellate court correctly pointed out, the negotiation of the check is in the nature of a \ncontract, and there can be no agreement until notice of acceptance is received. As a result, there was never \nacceptance as defined by § 3-409(a), and thus the Bank, pursuant to § 3-408 never was obligated to pay \nthe check under § 3-413(a). Thus, the answer to Petitioner’s second question [Did the lower court err in \nfinding the Bank did not accept the…check at issue, as “acceptance” is defined in UCC Section 3-409?] is \n“no.” \n \n“Conversion” under § 3-420. \n \nBecause it never accepted the check, Bank of America argues that the intermediate appellate court also \ncorrectly concluded that the Bank did not convert the check or its proceeds under § 3-420. Again, we must \nagree. The Court of Special Appeals stated: \n \n“Conversion,” we have held, “requires not merely temporary interference with property rights, \nbut the exercise of unauthorized dominion and control to the complete exclusion of the rightful \npossessor.” [Citation] At no time did [Respondent] exercise “unauthorized dominion and control \n[over the check] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,” [Petitioner]. \n \n[Petitioner] voluntarily gave the check to [Respondent’s] teller. When [Petitioner] indicated to the \nteller that he was not an account holder, she gave the check back to him for a thumbprint \nsignature in accordance with bank policy. After being informed by both [Respondent’s] teller and \nbranch manager that it was [Respondent’s] policy not to cash a non-account holder’s check \nwithout a thumbprint signature, [Petitioner] left the bank with the check in hand. \n \nBecause [Petitioner] gave the check to the teller, [Respondent’s] possession of that check was \nanything but “unauthorized,” and having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to \n[Petitioner] for his thumbprint signature, [Respondent] never exercised “dominion and control",

Background \nMartin, an attorney, received an e-mail message on August 16, 2008, from a person who called himself \nRoman Hidotashi. Hidotashi claimed that he was a representative of Chipang Lee Song Manufacturing \nCompany and needed to hire a lawyer to collect millions of dollars from past-due accounts of North \nAmerican customers. Martin agreed to represent the company. \n \nOn September 8, 2008, Martin received a check for $290,986.15 from a purported Chipang Lee Song \nManufacturing Company customer, even though Martin had yet to commence any collections work. The \ncheck, which was drawn on First Century Bank USA, arrived in an envelope with a Canadian postmark \nand no return address. The check was accompanied by an undated transmittal letter. Martin endorsed the \ncheck and deposited it in his client trust account at PNC. Martin then e-mailed Hidotashi, reported that \nhe had deposited the check, and stated that he would await further instructions. \n \nHidotashi responded to Martin’s e-mail message on September 9, 2008. Hidotashi stated that he had an \n“immediate need for funds” and instructed Martin to wire $130,600 to a bank account in Tokyo. Martin \nwent to PNC’s main office in Louisville the next morning and met with representative Craig Friedman. \nAccording to Martin, Friedman advised that the check Martin deposited had cleared. Martin instructed \nFriedman to wire $130,600 to the Tokyo account. \n \nMartin returned to PNC later the same day. According to Martin, Friedman accessed Martin’s account \ninformation and said, “I don’t understand this. The check was cleared yesterday.

[Citation] \n \nIn sum, the court must grant summary judgment in PNC’s favor on the breach-of-transfer-warranties \nclaim because the parties do not contest any material facts, which establish Martin’s liability. \n \nB. Breach of Contract \nPNC is also entitled to summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim because the undisputed facts \nestablish Martin’s liability. \n \nTo support its allegation that a contract existed, PNC filed copies of Martin’s account agreement and \nMartin’s accompanying signature card. Under the agreement’s terms, Martin agreed to bind himself to the \nagreement by signing the signature card. Martin does not dispute that the account agreement was a \nbinding contract, and he does not dispute the account agreement’s terms. \n \nMartin’s account agreement authorized PNC to charge Martin’s account for the value of any item returned \nto PNC unpaid or any item on which PNC did not receive payment. If PNC’s charge-back created an \noverdraft, Martin was required to pay PNC the amount of the overdraft immediately. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n929 \nThe scam of which Martin was a victim falls squarely within the charge-back provision of the account \nagreement. The check was returned to PNC unpaid. PNC charged Martin’s account, leaving it with an \noverdraft. Martin was obliged to pay PNC immediately. \n \nAs with the breach-of-transfer-warranties claim, Martin cannot defend against the breach-of-contract \nclaim by arguing that PNC made a mistake. The account agreement authorized PNC to charge back \nMartin’s account “even if the amount of the item has already been made available to you.” The account \nagreement, as a result, placed the risk of loss on Martin. Any mistake on PNC’s part was immaterial \nbecause PNC always had the right to charge back Martin’s account. [Citation] \n \nC. Martin’s Counterclaims \nMartin has asserted counterclaims for violations of various Uniform Commercial Code provisions; \nnegligence and failure to exercise ordinary care; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract and \nbreach of the implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing; detrimental reliance; conversion; and \nnegligent retention and supervision. Martin argues that “[t]o the extent that either party should be \nentitled to summary judgment in this case, it would be Martin with respect to his counterclaims against \nPNC.” Martin, however, has not moved for summary judgment on his counterclaims, and the court does \nnot address them on PNC’s motion. \n \nD. Damages \nPNC’s recovery under both theories of liability is contingent on PNC’s demonstrating that it acted in good \nfaith. PNC may recover for breach of the transfer warranties only if it took the check in good faith. § 3-\n416(b). Moreover, PNC must satisfy the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which Kentucky \nlaw incorporates in the account agreement. [Citation] Good faith, under both theories, means honesty in \nfact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. That means “contracts impose \non the parties thereto a duty to do everything necessary to carry them out.” [Citation] \n \nThe undisputed evidence establishes that PNC acted in good faith. PNC accepted deposit of Martin’s \ncheck, attempted to present the check for payment at First Century Bank, and charged back Martin’s \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n930 \naccount when the check was dishonored. Martin cannot claim that PNC lacked good faith and fair dealing \nwhen PNC took actions permitted under the contract. [Citation] Although PNC might have had the ability \nto investigate the authenticity of the check before crediting Martin’s account, PNC bore no such obligation \nbecause Martin warranted that the check was authentic. [UCC] § 3-416(a). Friedman’s and Jennewein’s \nstatements do not impute a lack of good faith to PNC, even if Martin could support the statements with \ncompetent evidence. The Uniform Commercial Code and the account agreement place the risk of loss on \nMartin, even if PNC made a mistake. \n \nMartin suggests that an insurance carrier might have already reimbursed PNC for the loss.

The act provides certain warranties to protect \nrecipients of substitute checks that are intended to protect recipients against losses associated with the \ncheck substitution process. One of these warranties provides that “[a] bank that transfers, presents, or \nreturns a substitute check…for which it receives consideration warrants…that…[t]he substitute check \nmeets the requirements of legal equivalence” (12 CFR § 229.52(a)(1)). The Check 21 Act does not replace \nexisting state laws regarding such instruments. The Uniform Commercial Code still applies, and we turn \nto it next. \n \nTwo notable consequences of the Check 21 Act are worth mentioning. The first is that a check may be \npresented to the payor bank for payment very quickly, perhaps in less than an hour: the customer’s “float” \ntime is abbreviated. That means be sure you have enough money in your account to cover the checks that \nyou write. The second consequence of Check 21 Act is that it is now possible for anybody—you at home or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n944 \nthe merchant from whom you are buying something—to scan a check and deposit it instantly. “Remote \ndeposit capture” allows users to transmit a scanned image of a check for posting and clearing using a web-\nconnected computer and a check scanner. The user clicks to send the deposit to the desired existing bank \naccount. Many merchants are using this system: that’s why if you write a check at the hardware store you \nmay see it scanned and returned immediately to you. The digital data are transmitted, and the scanned \nimage may be retrieved, if needed, as a “substitute check.” \n \nUCC Article 4: Aspects of Bank Operations \nReason for Article 4 \nOver the years, the states had begun to enact different statutes to regulate the check collection process. \nEighteen states adopted the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code; many others enacted \nDeferred Posting statutes. Not surprisingly, a desire for uniformity was the principal reason for the \nadoption of UCC Article 4. Article 4 absorbed many of the rules of the American Bankers Association Code \nand of the principles of the Deferred Posting statutes, as well as court decisions and common customs not \npreviously codified. \n \nBanks Covered \nArticle 4 covers three types of banks: depository banks, payor banks, and collecting banks. These terms—\nalready mentioned earlier—are defined in UCC Section 4-105. A depositary bank is the first bank to which \nan item is transferred for collection. Section 4-104 defines “item” as “an instrument or a promise or order \nto pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment[,]…not including a credit or debit card slip.” A \npayor bank is any bank that must pay a check because it is drawn on the bank or accepted there—the \ndrawee bank (a depositary bank may also be a payor bank). A collecting bank is any bank except the payor \nbank that handles the item for collection. \n \nTechnical Rules \nDetailed coverage of Parts 2 and 3 of Article 4, the substantive provisions, is beyond the scope of this \nbook. However, Article 4 answers several specific questions that bank customers most frequently ask. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n945 \n1. What is the effect of a “pay any bank” indorsement? The moment these words are indorsed on a \ncheck, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder. This restriction can be lifted whenever (a) the \ncheck has been returned to the customer initiating collection or (b) the bank specially indorses the \ncheck to a person who is not a bank (4-201). \n2.

May a depositary bank supply a missing indorsement? It may supply any indorsement of the \ncustomer necessary to title unless the check contains words such as “payee’s indorsement required.” \nIf the customer fails to indorse a check when depositing it in his account, the bank’s notation that the \ncheck was deposited by a customer or credited to his account takes effect as the customer’s \nindorsement. (Section 4-205(1)). \n3. Are any warranties given in the collection process? Yes. They are identical to those provided in \nArticle 3, except that they apply only to customers and collecting banks (4-207(a)). The customer or \ncollecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants (1) \nhe is entitled to enforce the item; (2) all signatures are authorized authentic; (3) the item has not \nbeen altered; (4) the item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment; (5) he has no knowledge \nof insolvency proceedings regarding the maker or acceptor or in the case of an unaccepted draft, the \ndrawer. These warranties cannot be disclaimed as to checks. \n4. Does the bank have the right to a charge-back against a customer’s account, or refund? The answer \nturns on whether the settlement was provisional or final. A settlement is the proper crediting of the \namount ordered to be paid by the instrument. Someone writes you a check for $1,000 drawn on First \nBank, and you deposit it in Second Bank. Second Bank will make a “provisional settlement” with \nyou—that is, it will provisionally credit your account with $1,000, and that settlement will be final \nwhen First Bank debits the check writer’s account and credits Second Bank with the funds. Under \nSection 4-212(1), as long as the settlement was still provisional, a collecting bank has the right to a \n“charge-back” or refund if the check “bounces” (is dishonored). However, if settlement was final, the \nbank cannot claim a refund. \n \nWhat determines whether settlement is provisional or final? Section 4-213(1) spells out four events \n(whichever comes first) that will convert a payor bank’s provisional settlement into final settlement: \nWhen it (a) pays the item in cash; (b) settles without reserving a right to revoke and without having a right \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n946 \nunder statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement with the customer; finishes posting the item to the \nappropriate account; or (d) makes provisional settlement and fails to revoke the settlement in the time \nand manner permitted by statute, clearinghouse rule, or agreement. All clearinghouses have rules \npermitting revocation of settlement within certain time periods. For example an item cleared before 10 \na.m. may be returned and the settlement revoked before 2 p.m. From this section it should be apparent \nthat a bank generally can prevent a settlement from becoming final if it chooses to do so. \n \nRelationship with Customers \nThe relationship between a bank and its customers is governed by UCC Article 4. However, Section 4-\n103(1) permits the bank to vary its terms, except that no bank can disclaim responsibility for failing to act \nin good faith or to exercise ordinary care. Most disputes between bank and customer arise when the bank \neither pays or refuses to pay a check. Under several provisions of Article 4, the bank is entitled to pay, \neven though the payment may be adverse to the customer’s interest. \n \nCommon Issues Arising between Banks and Their Customers \nPayment of Overdrafts \nSuppose a customer writes a check for a sum greater than the amount in her account. May the bank pay \nthe check and charge the customer’s account? Under Section 4-401(1), it may. Moreover, it may pay on an \naltered check and charge the customer’s account for the original tenor of the check, and if a check was \ncompleted it may pay the completed amount and charge the customer’s account, assuming the bank acted \nin good faith without knowledge that the completion was improper. \n \nPayment of Stale Checks \nSection 4-404 permits a bank to refuse to pay a check that was drawn more than six months before being \npresented. Banks ordinarily consider such checks to be “stale” and will refuse to pay them, but the same \nsection gives them the option to pay if they choose. A corporate dividend check, for example, will be \npresumed to be good more than six months later. The only exception to this rule is for certified checks, \nwhich must be paid whenever presented, since the customer’s account was charged when the check was \ncertified.",

Understand what a “wholesale transaction” is; recognize that UCC Article 4A governs such transactions, and \nrecognize how the Article addresses three common issues. \n2. Know what a “letter of credit” (LC) is, the source of law regarding LCs, and how such instruments are used. \n \n \nWholesale Funds Transfers \nAnother way that money is transferred is by commercial fund transfers or wholesale funds transfers, \nwhich is by far the largest segment of the US payment system measured in amounts of money transferred. \nIt is trillions of dollars a day. Wholesale transactions are the transfers of funds between businesses or \nfinancial institutions. \n \nBackground and Coverage \nIt was in the development of commercial “wholesale wire transfers” of money in the nineteeth and early \ntwentieth centuries that businesses developed the processes enabling the creation of today’s consumer \nelectronic funds transfers. Professor Jane Kaufman Winn described the development of uniform law \ngoverning commercial funds transfers: \n \nAlthough funds transfers conducted over funds transfer facilities maintained by the Federal \nReserve Banks were subject to the regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, many funds transfers \ntook place over private systems, such as the Clearing House for Interbank Payment Systems \n(“CHIPS”). The entire wholesale funds transfer system was not governed by a clear body of law \nuntil U.C.C. Article 4A was promulgated in 1989 and adopted by the states shortly thereafter. The \nArticle 4A drafting process resulted in many innovations, even though it drew heavily on the \npractices that had developed among banks and their customers during the 15 years before the \ndrafting committee was established. While a consensus was not easy to achieve, the community \nof interests shared by both the banks and their customers permitted the drafting process to find \nworkable compromises on many thorny issues.[1] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n958 \nAll states and US territories have adopted Article 4A. Consistent with other UCC provisions, the rights and \nobligations under Article 4A may be varied by agreement of the parties. Article 4A does not apply if any \nstep of the transaction is governed by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Although the implication may be \notherwise, the rules in Article 4A apply to any funds transfer, not just electronic ones (i.e., transfers by \nmail are covered, too). Certainly, however, electronic transfers are most common, and—as the Preface to \nArticle 4A notes—a number of characteristics of them influenced the Code’s rules. These transactions are \ncharacterized by large amounts of money—multimillions of dollars; the parties are sophisticated \nbusinesses or financial institutions; funds transfers are completed in one day, they are highly efficient \nsubstitutes for paper delivery; they are usually low cost—a few dollars for the funds transfer charged by \nthe sender’s bank. \n \nOperation of Article 4A \nThe UCC “Prefatory Note” to Article 4A observes that “the funds transfer that is covered by Article 4A is \nnot a complex transaction.” To illustrate the operation of Article 4A, assume that Widgets International \nhas an account with First Bank. In order to pay a supplier, Supplies Ltd., in China, Widgets instructs First \nBank to pay $6 million to the account of Supplies Ltd. in China Bank. In the terminology of Article 4A, \nWidgets’ instruction to its bank is a “payment order.” Widgets is the “sender” of the payment order, First \nBank is the “receiving bank,” and Supplies Ltd. is the “beneficiary” of the order. \n \nWhen First Bank performs the purchase order by instructing China Bank to credit the account of Supplies \nLimited, First Bank becomes a sender of a payment order, China Bank becomes a receiving bank, and",

The usual practice is for banks and their \ncustomers to agree to security procedures for the verification of payment orders. If a bank establishes a \ncommercially reasonable procedure, complies with that procedure, and acts in good faith and according to \nits agreement with the customer, the customer is bound by an unauthorized payment order. There is, \nhowever, an important exception to this rule. A customer will not be liable when the order is from a \nperson unrelated to its business operations. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n960 \nError by Sender \nSecond, who is responsible when the sender makes a mistake—for instance, in instructing payment \ngreater than what was intended? The general rule is that the sender is bound by its own error. But in cases \nwhere the error would have been discovered had the bank complied with its security procedure, the \nreceiving bank is liable for the excess over the amount intended by the sender, although the bank is \nallowed to recover this amount from the beneficiary. \n \nBank Mistake in Transferring Funds \nThird, what are the consequences when the bank makes a mistake in transferring funds? Suppose, for \nexample, that Widgets (in the previous situation) instructed payment of $2 million but First Bank in turn \ninstructed payment of $20 million.

Here are discussed the definition of letters of credit, the \nsource of law governing them, how they work as payments for exports and as payments for imports. \n \nDefinition \nA letter of credit is a statement by a bank (or other financial institution) that it will pay a specified sum \nof money to specific persons if certain conditions are met. Or, to rephrase, it is a letter issued by a bank \nauthorizing the bearer to draw a stated amount of money from the issuing bank (or its branches, or other \nassociated banks or agencies). Originally, a letter of credit was quite literally that—a letter addressed by \nthe buyer’s bank to the seller’s bank stating that the former could vouch for their good customer, the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n961 \nbuyer, and that it would pay the seller in case of the buyer’s default. An LC is issued by a bank on behalf of \nits creditworthy customers, whose application for the credit has been approved by that bank. \n \nSource of Law \nLetters of credit are governed by both international and US domestic law. \n \nInternational Law \nMany countries (including the United States) have bodies of law governing letters of credit. Sophisticated \ntraders will agree among themselves by which body of law they choose to be governed. They can agree to \nbe bound by the UCC, or they may decide they prefer to be governed by the Uniform Customs and Practice \nfor Commercial Documentary Credits (UCP), a private code devised by the Congress of the International \nChamber of Commerce.

Julius is in New York and Rochelle is in Paris; does French law \nor New York law govern? The answer will depend on the particulars of the dispute. An American court \nmust determine under the applicable principles of the law of “conflicts of law” whether New York or \nFrench law applies. \n \nDomestic Law \nThe principal body of law applicable to the letter of credit in the United States is Article 5 of the UCC. \nSection 5-103 declares that Article 5 “applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations \narising out of transactions involving letters of credit.” The Official Comment to 5-101 observes, “A letter of \ncredit is an idiosyncratic form of undertaking that supports performance of an obligation incurred in a \nseparate financial, mercantile, or other transaction or arrangement.” And—as is the case in other parts of \nthe Code—parties may, within some limits, agree to “variation by agreement in order to respond to and \naccommodate developments in custom and usage that are not inconsistent with the essential definitions \nand mandates of the statute.” Although detailed consideration of Article 5 is beyond the scope of this \nbook, a distinction between guarantees and letters of credit should be noted: Article 5 applies to the latter \nand not the former. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n962 \nLetters of Credit as Payment for Exports \nThe following discussion presents how letters of credit work as payment for exports, and a sample letter of \ncredit is presented at Figure 23.4 \"A Letter of Credit\". \n \nFigure 23.4 A Letter of Credit \n \nJulius desires to sell fine quality magic wands and other stage props to Rochelle’s Gallery in Paris. \nRochelle agrees to pay by letter of credit—she will, in effect, get her bank to inform Julius that he will get \npaid if the goods are right. She does so by “opening” a letter of credit at her bank—the issuing bank—the \nBanque de Rue de Houdini where she has funds in her account, or good credit. She tells the bank the \nterms of sale, the nature and quantity of the goods, the amount to be paid, the documents she will require \nas proof of shipment, and an expiration date. Banque de Rue de Houdini then directs its correspondent \nbank in the United States, First Excelsior Bank, to inform Julius that the letter of credit has been opened: \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n963 \nRochelle is good for it. For Julius to have the strongest guarantee that he will be paid, Banque de Rou de \nHoudini can ask First Excelsior to confirm the letter of credit, thus binding both Banque de Rue de \nHoudini and Excelsior to pay according to the terms of the letter. \n \nOnce Julius is informed that the letter of credit has been issued and confirmed, he can proceed to ship the \ngoods and draw a draft to present (along with the required documents such as commercial invoice, bill of \nlading, and insurance policy) to First Excelsior, which is bound to follow exactly its instructions from \nBanque de Rue de Houdini. Julius can present the draft and documents directly, through correspondent \nbanks, or by a representative at the port from which he is shipping the goods. On presentation, First \nExcelsior may forward the documents to Banque de Rue de Houdini for approval and when First Excelsior \nis satisfied it will take the draft and pay Julius immediately on a sight draft or will stamp the draft \n“accepted” if it is a time draft (payable in thirty, sixty, or ninety days). Julius can discount an accepted \ntime draft or hold it until it matures and cash it in for the full amount. First Excelsior will then forward \nthe draft through international banking channels to Banque de Rue de Houdini to debit Rochelle’s \naccount. \n \nAs Payment for Imports \nUS importers—buyers—also can use the letter of credit to pay for goods bought from abroad. The \nimporter’s bank may require that the buyer put up collateral to guarantee it will be reimbursed for \npayment of the draft when it is presented by the seller’s agents. Since the letter of credit ordinarily will be \nirrevocable, the bank will be bound to pay the draft when presented (assuming the proper documents are \nattached), regardless of deficiencies ultimately found in the goods. The bank will hold the bill of lading",

The Lumber Company “laminated” the two by six-inch boards to \nmake them stronger. However, carpenter Dennis Baker inspected the boards and determined that the \nboards were not laminated properly. \n \nMeade hired Baker to repair the barn.

Specifically, the Bank asserts that Meade did not issue the stop payment order within \na reasonable time for the Bank to act upon it, and therefore that the trial court should have granted \nsummary judgment in favor of the Bank. \n \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when it has been established: (1) that there is no genuine issue as \nto any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that \nreasonable minds can come to only one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving \nparty. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n967 \n[UCC 4-403(A)] provides that a customer may stop payment on any item drawn on the customer’s \naccount by issuing an order to the bank that describes the item with reasonable certainty and is received \nby the bank “at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before \nany action by the bank with respect to the item.” What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the \nfacts of the case. See Chute v. Bank One of Akron, (1983) [Citation] \n \nIn Chute, Bank One alleged that its customer, Mr. Chute, did not give it a reasonable opportunity to act \nupon his stop payment order when he gave an oral stop payment at one Bank One branch office, and a \ndifferent Bank One branch office paid the check the following day. In ruling that Bank One had a \nreasonable opportunity to act upon Mr. Chute’s order before it paid the check, the court considered the \nteller’s testimony that stop payment orders are entered onto the computer upon receipt, where they are \nvirtually immediately accessible to all Bank One tellers. \n \nIn this case, as in Chute, Meade gave notice one day, and the Bank paid the check the following day. \nAdditionally, in this case, the same branch that took the stop payment order also paid the check. \nMoreover, Evans testified that the Bank’s policy for stop payment orders is to enter them into the \ncomputer immediately, and that Meade’s stop payment order may have shown up on the computer on \nSaturday if she had entered it on Friday. Based on this information, and construing the facts in the light \nmost favorable to Meade, reasonable minds could conclude that Meade provided the Bank with the stop \npayment order within time for the Bank to act upon the stop payment order. Accordingly, we overrule the \nBank’s first assignment of error. \n \nIII. \nIn its second assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in permitting Meade to \ntestify regarding the amount he spent on court costs, attorney fees, and taking depositions. Meade \ncontends that because he incurred these costs as a result of the Bank paying his check over a valid stop \npayment order, the costs are properly recoverable. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n968 \nAs a general rule, the costs and expenses of litigation, other than court costs, are not recoverable in an \naction for damages. [Citations] \n \nIn this case, the statute providing for damages, [UCC 4-403(c)], provides that a customer’s recoverable \nloss for a bank’s failure to honor a valid stop payment order “may include damages for dishonor of \nsubsequent items * * *.” The statute does not provide for recouping attorney fees and costs.

Pursuant to [UCC 4-403(c)] “[t]he burden of establishing the fact \nand amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop payment order or order to \nclose an account is on the customer.” Establishing the fact and amount of loss, “the customer must show \nsome loss other than the mere debiting of the customer’s account.” [Citation] \n \n…Baker testified that he charged Meade between two hundred-eighty and three hundred dollars to \nproperly laminate the runners and support the barn. Based upon these facts, we find that the record \ncontains sufficient evidence that Meade sustained some loss beyond the mere debiting of his account as a \nresult of the Bank paying his check. Accordingly, we overrule the Bank’s third assignment of error. \n \nV. \n…In its final assignment of error, the Bank contends that the trial court erred in denying its motions for \njudgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial.… \n[U]nlike our consideration of the Bank’s motions for a directed verdict, in considering the Bank’s motion \nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we also must consider whether the amount of the jury’s award \nis supported by sufficient evidence. The Bank contends the jury’s general verdict, awarding Meade \n$3,800, is not supported by evidence in the record. \n \nA bank customer seeking damages for the improper payment of a check over a valid stop payment order \ncarries the burden of proving “the fact and amount of loss.” [UCC 4-403(C).] To protect banks and \nprevent unjust enrichment to customers, the mere debiting of the customer’s account does not constitute \na loss. [Citation] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n970 \nIn this case, the Bank’s payment of Meade’s $1,406.79 check to the Lumber Company discharged Meade’s \ndebt to the Lumber Company in the same amount. Therefore, the mere debiting of $1,406.79 from \nMeade’s account does not constitute a loss. \n \nMeade presented evidence that he incurred $300 in repair costs to make the barn satisfactory. Meade also \nnotes that he never got the four by six-inch runners he wanted. However, Meade’s carpenter, Baker, \ntestified that since he properly laminated the two by six-inch runners, they are just as strong or stronger \nthan the four by six-inch runners would have been. \n \nMeade also presented evidence of his costs and fees. However, as we determined in our review of the \nBank’s second assignment of error, only the court may award costs and fees, and therefore this evidence \nwas improperly admitted. Thus, the evidence cannot support the damage award. Meade did not present \nany other evidence of loss incurred by the Bank’s payment of his check.…Therefore, we find that the trial \ncourt erred in declining to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of damages.

Recognize that there are laws prohibiting discrimination in credit granting. \n4. Understand how consumers’ credit records are maintained and may be corrected. \n \n \nThe Cost of Credit \nLenders, whether banks or retailers, are not free to charge whatever they wish for credit. Usury laws \nestablish a maximum rate of lawful interest. The penalties for violating usury laws vary from state to state. \nThe heaviest penalties are loss of both principal and interest, or loss of a multiple of the interest the \ncreditor charged. The courts often interpret these laws stringently, so that even if the impetus for a \nusurious loan comes from the borrower, the contract can be avoided, as demonstrated in Matter of Dane’s \nEstate (Section 24.3 \"Cases\"). \n \nSome states have eliminated interest rate limits altogether. In other states, usury law is riddled with \nexceptions, and indeed, in many cases, the exceptions have pretty much eaten up the general rule. Here \nare some common exceptions: \n \n• \nBusiness loans. In many states, businesses may be charged any interest rate, although some states \nlimit this exception to incorporated businesses. \n• \nMortgage loans. Mortgage loans are often subject to special usury laws. The allowable interest \nrates vary, depending on whether a first mortgage or a subordinate mortgage is given, or whether \nthe loan is insured or provided by a federal agency, among other variables. \n• \nSecond mortgages and home equity loans by licensed consumer loan companies. \n• \nCredit card and other retail installment debt. The interest rate for these is governed by the law of \nthe state where the credit card company does business. (That’s why the giant Citibank, otherwise \nheadquartered in New York City, runs its credit card division out of South Dakota, which has no \nusury laws for credit cards.) \n• \nConsumer leasing. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n988 \n• \n“Small loans” such as payday loans and pawnshop loans. \n• \nLease-purchases on personal property.

Understand that consumers have the right to cancel some purchases made on credit. \n2. Know how billing mistakes may be corrected. \n3. Recognize that professional debt collectors are governed by some laws restricting certain practices. \n \n \nCancellation Rights \nOrdinarily, a contract is binding when signed. But consumer protection laws sometimes provide an escape \nvalve. For example, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation gives consumers three days to cancel \ncontracts made with door-to-door salespersons. Under this cooling-off provision, the cancellation is \neffective if made by midnight of the third business day after the date of the purchase agreement. The \nsalesperson must notify consumers of this right and supply them with two copies of a cancellation form, \nand the sales agreement must contain a statement explaining the right. The purchaser cancels by \nreturning one copy of the cancellation form to the seller, who is obligated either to pick up the goods or to \npay shipping costs. The three-day cancellation privilege applies only to sales of twenty-five dollars or more \nmade either in the home or away from the seller’s place of business; it does not apply to sales made by \nmail or telephone, to emergency repairs and certain other home repairs, or to real estate, insurance, or \nsecurities sales. \n \nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects consumers in a similar way. For certain big-ticket purchases \n(such as installations made in the course of major home improvements), sellers sometimes require a \nmortgage (which is subordinate to any preexisting mortgages) on the home. The law gives such customers \nthree days to rescind the contract. Many states have laws similar to the FTC’s three-day cooling-off period, \nand these may apply to transactions not covered by the federal rule (e.g., to purchases of less than twenty-\nfive dollars and even to certain contracts made at the seller’s place of business). \n \nCorrecting Billing Mistakes \nBilling Mistakes \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n998 \nIn 1975, Congress enacted the Fair Credit Billing Act as an amendment to the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act. It was intended to put to an end the phenomenon, by then a standard part of any \ncomedian’s repertoire, of the many ways a computer could insist that you pay a bill, despite errors and \ndespite letters you might have written to complain. The act, which applies only to open-end credit and not \nto installment sales, sets out a procedure that creditors and customers must follow to rectify claimed \nerrors. The customer has sixty days to notify the creditor of the nature of the error and the amount. Errors \ncan include charges not incurred or those billed with the wrong description, charges for goods never \ndelivered, accounting or arithmetic errors, failure to credit payments or returns, and even charges for \nwhich you simply request additional information, including proof of sale. During the time the creditor is \nreplying, you need not pay the questioned item or any finance charge on the disputed amount. \n \nThe creditor has thirty days to respond and ninety days to correct your account or explain why your belief \nthat an error has been committed is incorrect.

Failure of the \ncreditor to follow the rules, an explanation of which must be provided to each customer every six months \nand when a dispute arises, bars it from collecting the first fifty dollars in dispute, plus finance charges, \neven if the creditor turns out to be correct. \n \nDisputes about the Quality of Goods or Services Purchased \nWhile disputes over the quality of goods are not “billing errors,” the act does apply to unsatisfactory goods \nor services purchased by credit card (except for store credit cards); the customer may assert against the \ncredit card company any claims or defenses he or she may have against the seller. This means that under \ncertain circumstances, the customer may withhold payments without incurring additional finance \ncharges. However, this right is subject to three limitations: (1) the value of the goods or services charged \nmust be in excess of fifty dollars, (2) the goods or services must have been purchased either in the home \nstate or within one hundred miles of the customer’s current mailing address, and (3) the consumer must \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n999 \nmake a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute before refusing to pay. If the consumer does refuse to pay, \nthe credit card company would acquiesce: it would credit her account for the disputed amount, pass the \nloss down to the merchant’s bank, and that bank would debit the merchant’s account. The merchant \nwould then have to deal with the consumer directly. \n \n \nDebt Collection Practices \nBanks, financial institutions, and retailers have different incentives for extending credit—for some, a loan \nis simply a means of making money, and for others, it is an inducement to buyers. But in either case, \ncredit is a risk because the consumer may default; the creditor needs a means of collecting when the \ncustomer fails to pay. Open-end credit is usually given without collateral. The creditor can, of course, sue, \nbut if the consumer has no assets, collection can be troublesome. Historically, three different means of \nrecovering the debt have evolved: garnishment, wage assignment, and confession of judgment. \n \nGarnishment \nGarnishment is a legal process by which a creditor obtains a court order directing the debtor’s employer \n(or any party who owes money to the debtor) to pay directly to the creditor a certain portion of the \nemployee’s wages until the debt is paid. Until 1970, garnishment was regulated by state law, and its effects \ncould be devastating—in some cases, even leading to suicide. In 1970, Title III of the Consumer Credit \nProtection Act asserted federal control over garnishment proceedings for the first time. The federal wage-\ngarnishment law limits the amount of employee earnings that may be withheld in any one pay date to the \nlesser of 25 percent of disposable (after-tax) earnings or the amount by which disposable weekly earnings \nexceed thirty times the highest current federal minimum wage. The federal law covers everyone who \nreceives personal earnings, including wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and retirement income \n(though not tips), but it allows courts to garnish above the federal maximum in cases involving support \npayments (e.g., alimony), in personal bankruptcy cases, and in cases where the debt owed is for state or \nfederal tax. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1000 \nThe federal wage-garnishment law also prohibits an employer from firing any worker solely because the \nworker’s pay has been garnished for one debt (multiple garnishments may be grounds for discharge). The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places",

The \npenalty for violating this provision is a $1,000 fine, one-year imprisonment, or both. But the law does not \nsay that an employee fired for having one debt garnished may sue the employer for damages. In a 1980 \ncase, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied an employee the right to sue, holding that the statute places \nenforcement exclusively in the hands of the federal secretary of labor. [1] \n \nThe l970 federal statute is not the only limitation on the garnishment process. Note that the states can \nalso still regulate garnishment so long as the state regulation is not in conflict with federal law: North \nCarolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas prohibit most garnishments, unless it is the \ngovernment doing the garnishment. And there is an important constitutional limitation as well. Many \nstates once permitted a creditor to garnish the employee’s wage even before the case came to court: a \nsimple form from the clerk of the court was enough to freeze a debtor’s wages, often before the debtor \nknew a suit had been brought. In 1969, the US Supreme Court held that this prejudgment garnishment \nprocedure was unconstitutional. [2] \n \nWage Assignment \nA wage assignment is an agreement by an employee that a creditor may take future wages as security \nfor a loan or to pay an existing debt. With a wage assignment, the creditor can collect directly from the \nemployer. However, in some states, wage assignments are unlawful, and an employer need not honor the \nagreement (indeed, it would be liable to the employee if it did). Other states regulate wage assignments in \nvarious ways—for example, by requiring that the assignment be a separate instrument, not part of the \nloan agreement, and by specifying that no wage assignment is valid beyond a certain period of time (two \nor three years). \n \nConfession of Judgment \nBecause suing is at best nettlesome, many creditors have developed forms that allow them to sidestep the \ncourthouse when debtors have defaulted. As part of the original credit agreement, the consumer or \nborrower waives his right to defend himself in court by signing a confession of judgment. This written \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1001 \ninstrument recites the debtor’s agreement that a court order be automatically entered against him in the \nevent of default. The creditor’s lawyer simply takes the confession of judgment to the clerk of the court, \nwho enters it in the judgment book of the court without ever consulting a judge. Entry of the judgment \nentitles the creditor to attach the debtor’s assets to satisfy the debt. Like prejudgment garnishment, a \nconfession of judgment gives the consumer no right to be heard, and it has been banned by statute or \ncourt decisions in many states. \n \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 \nMany stores, hospitals, and other organizations attempt on their own to collect unpaid bills, but \nthousands of merchants, professionals, and small businesses rely on collection agencies to recover \naccounts receivable. The debt collection business employed some 216,000 people in 2007 and collected \nover $40 billion in debt. [3] For decades, some of these collectors used harassing tactics: posing as \ngovernment agents or attorneys, calling at the debtor’s workplace, threatening physical harm or loss of \nproperty or imprisonment, using abusive language, publishing a deadbeats list, misrepresenting the size \nof the debt, and telling friends and neighbors about the debt. To provide a remedy for these abuses, \nCongress enacted, as part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act \n(FDCPA) in 1977. \n \nThis law regulates the manner by which third-party collection agencies conduct their business. It covers \ncollection of all personal, family, and household debts by collection agencies. It does not deal with \ncollection by creditors themselves; the consumer’s remedy for abusive debt collection by the creditor is in \ntort law. \n \nUnder the FDCPA, the third-party collector may contact the debtor only during reasonable hours and not \nat work if the debtor’s employer prohibits it. The debtor may write the collector to cease contact, in which \ncase the agency is prohibited from further contact (except to confirm that there will be no further contact). \nA written denial that money is owed stops the bill collector for thirty days, and he can resume again only \nafter the debtor is sent proof of the debt. Collectors may no longer file suit in remote places, hoping for \ndefault judgments; any suit must be filed in a court where the debtor lives or where the underlying \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1002",

[New York law] makes any note for which more than the legal rate \nof interests is ‘reserved or taken’ or ‘agreed to be reserved or taken’ void. [The law] commands \ncancellation of a note in violation of [its provisions]. Here, since both sides concede that the note \nevidences the complete agreement between the parties, we cannot aid appellant by reliance upon the \npresumption that he did not make the loan at a usurious rate [Citation]. The terms of the loan are not in \ndispute. Thus, the note itself establishes, on its face, clear evidence of usury. There is no requirement of a \nspecific intent to violate the usury statute. A general intent to charge more than the legal rate as evidenced \nby the note, is all that is needed. If the lender intends to take and receive a rate in excess of the legal \npercentage at the time the note is made, the statute condemns the act and mandates its cancellation \n[Citation]. The showing, as here, that the note reserves to the lender an illegal rate of interest satisfies \nrespondents’ burden of proving a usurious loan. \n \nNext, where the rate of interest on the face of a note is in excess of the legal rate, it cannot be argued that \nsuch a loan may be saved because the borrower prompted the loan or even set the rate. The usury statutes \nare for the protection of the borrower and [their] purpose would be thwarted if the lender could avoid its \nconsequences by asking the borrower to set the rate. Since the respondents herein asserted the defense of \nusury, it cannot be said that the decedent waived the defense by setting or agreeing to the 7 1/2% Rate of \ninterest. \n \nFinally, equitable considerations cannot be indulged when, as here, a statute specifically condemns an act. \nThe statute fixes the law, and it must be followed. \n \nThe order should be affirmed, without costs. \n \n \n \n \nCASE QUESTIONS \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1005 \n \n1.

Because the Act does not prohibit discrimination based on the manner in which someone \ndresses, Park West’s requirement that Rosa change his clothes does not give rise to claims of \nillegal discrimination. Further, even if Park West’s statement or action were based upon Rosa’s \nsexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation, the Act does not prohibit such discrimination. \n \nPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins (U.S. Supreme Court, 1988), which Rosa relied on, was not to the contrary, \naccording to the district court, because that case “neither holds, nor even suggests, that discrimination \nbased merely on a person’s attire is impermissible.” \n \nOn appeal, Rosa says that the district court “fundamentally misconceived the law as applicable to the \nPlaintiff’s claim by concluding that there may be no relationship, as a matter of law, between telling a \nbank customer what to wear and sex discrimination.” …The Bank says that Rosa loses for two reasons. \nFirst, citing cases pertaining to gays and transsexuals, it says that the ECOA does not apply to \ncrossdressers. Second, the Bank says that its employee genuinely could not identify Rosa, which is why \nshe asked him to go home and change. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1007 \nIII. \n…In interpreting the ECOA, this court looks to Title VII case law, that is, to federal employment \ndiscrimination law.…The Bank itself refers us to Title VII case law to interpret the ECOA. \n \nThe ECOA prohibits discrimination, “with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction[,] on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age.” 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a). Thus to prevail, the \nalleged discrimination against Rosa must have been “on the basis of…sex.” See [Citation.] The ECOA’s sex \ndiscrimination prohibition “protects men as well as women.” \n \nWhile the district court was correct in saying that the prohibited bases of discrimination under the ECOA \ndo not include style of dress or sexual orientation, that is not the discrimination alleged. It is alleged that \nthe Bank’s actions were taken, in whole or in part, “on the basis of… [the appellant’s] sex.” The Bank, by \nseeking dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), subjected itself to rigorous standards. We may affirm dismissal \n“only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with \nthe allegations.” [Citations] Whatever facts emerge, and they may turn out to have nothing to do with sex-\nbased discrimination, we cannot say at this point that the plaintiff has no viable theory of sex \ndiscrimination consistent with the facts alleged. \n \nThe evidence is not yet developed, and thus it is not yet clear why Brunelle told Rosa to go home and \nchange. It may be that this case involves an instance of disparate treatment based on sex in the denial of \ncredit. See [Citation]; (“‘Disparate treatment’…is the most easily understood type of discrimination. The \nemployer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their…sex.”); [Citation] \n(invalidating airline’s policy of weight limitations for female “flight hostesses” but not for similarly \nsituated male “directors of passenger services” as impermissible disparate treatment); [Citation] \n(invalidating policy that female employees wear uniforms but that similarly situated male employees need \nwear only business dress as impermissible disparate treatment); [Citation] (invalidating rule requiring \nabandonment upon marriage of surname that was applied to women, but not to men). It is reasonable to \ninfer that Brunelle told Rosa to go home and change because she thought that Rosa’s attire did not accord \nwith his male gender: in other words, that Rosa did not receive the loan application because he was a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1008 \nman, whereas a similarly situated woman would have received the loan application. That is, the Bank may \ntreat, for credit purposes, a woman who dresses like a man differently than a man who dresses like a \nwoman. If so, the Bank concedes, Rosa may have a claim. Indeed, under Price Waterhouse, “stereotyped \nremarks [including statements about dressing more ‘femininely’] can certainly be evidence that gender \nplayed a part.” [Citation.] It is also reasonable to infer, though, that Brunelle refused to give Rosa the loan",

McCullough \n296 F.Supp.2d 895 (W.D. Tenn. 2003) \n \nBackground \nThis case concerns Defendants’ receipt and use of Christine Rodgers’ consumer report. The material facts \ndo not seem to be disputed. The parties agree that Ms. Rodgers gave birth to a daughter, Meghan, on May \n4, 2001. Meghan’s father is Raymond Anthony. Barbara McCullough, an attorney, represented Mr. \nAnthony in a child custody suit against Ms. Rodgers in which Mr. Anthony sought to obtain custody and \nchild support from Ms. Rodgers. Ms. McCullough received, reviewed, and used Ms. Rodgers’ consumer \nreport in connection with the child custody case. \n \nOn September 25, 2001, Ms. McCullough instructed Gloria Christian, her secretary, to obtain Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report. Ms. McCullough received the report on September 27 or 28 of 2001. She \nreviewed the report in preparation for her examination of Ms. Rodgers during a hearing to be held in \njuvenile court on October 23, 2001. She also used the report during the hearing, including attempting to \nmove the document into evidence and possibly handing it to the presiding judge. \n \nThe dispute in this case centers around whether Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms. Rodgers’ \nconsumer report for a purpose permitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”). Plaintiff \ncontends that Ms. McCullough, as well as her law firm, Wilkes, McCullough & Wagner, a partnership, and \nher partners, Calvin J. McCullough and John C. Wagner, are liable for the unlawful receipt and use of Ms. \nRodgers’ consumer report in violation 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681 o(negligent failure to comply with the FCRA) and \n1681n (willful failure to comply with the FCRA or obtaining a consumer report under false pretenses). \nPlaintiff has also sued Defendants for the state law tort of unlawful invasion of privacy.… \n \nAnalysis \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1010 \nPlaintiff has moved for summary judgment on the questions of whether Defendants failed to comply with \nthe FCRA (i.e. whether Defendants had a permissible purpose to obtain Ms. Rodgers’ credit report), \nwhether Defendants’ alleged failure to comply was willful, and whether Defendants’ actions constituted \nunlawful invasion of privacy. The Court will address the FCRA claims followed by the state law claim for \nunlawful invasion of privacy. \n \nA. Permissible Purpose under the FCRA \nPursuant to the FCRA, “A person shall not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose unless (1) the \nconsumer report is obtained for a purpose for which the consumer report is authorized to be furnished \nunder this section.…” [Citation.] Defendants do not dispute that Ms. McCullough obtained and used Ms.",

Defendants \ndo not allege that these constitute permissible purposes under the FCRA. \n \n \n \n24.4 Summary and Exercises \n \nSummary \nConsumers who are granted credit have long received protection through usury laws (laws that establish a \nmaximum interest rate). The rise in consumer debt in recent years has been matched by an increase in \nfederal regulation of consumer credit transactions. The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of credit \nterms; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits certain types of discrimination in the granting of credit; \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act gives consumers access to their credit dossiers and prohibits unapproved \nuse of credit-rating information. After entering into a credit transaction, a consumer has certain \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1015 \ncancellation rights and may use a procedure prescribed by the Fair Credit Billing Act to correct billing \nerrors. Traditional debt collection practices—garnishment, wage assignments, and confession of judgment \nclauses—are now subject to federal regulation, as are the practices of collection agencies under the Fair \nDebt Collection Practices Act. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1. Carlene Consumer entered into an agreement with Rent to Buy, Inc., to rent a computer for $20 per week. \nThe agreement also provided that if Carlene chose to rent the computer for fifty consecutive weeks, she \nwould own it. She then asserted that the agreement was not a lease but a sale on credit subject to the \nTruth in Lending Act, and that Rent to Buy, Inc., violated the act by failing to state the annual percentage \nrate. Is Carlene correct? \n2. Carlos, a resident of Chicago, was on a road trip to California when he heard a noise under the hood of his \ncar. He took the car to a mechanic for repair. The mechanic overhauled the power steering unit and billed \nCarlos $600, which he charged on his credit card. Later that day—Carlos having driven about fifty miles—\nthe car made the same noise, and Carlos took it to another mechanic, who diagnosed the problem as a \nloose exhaust pipe connection at the manifold. Carlos was billed $300 for this repair, with which he was \nsatisfied. Carlos returned to Chicago and examined his credit card statement. What rights has he as to the \n$600 charge on his card? \n3. Ken was the owner of Scrimshaw, a company that manufactured and sold carvings made on fossilized ivory. \nHe applied for a loan from Bank. Bank found him creditworthy, but seeking additional security for \nrepayment, it required his wife, Linda, to sign a guaranty as well. During a subsequent recession, demand \nfor scrimshaw fell, and Ken’s business went under. Bank filed suit against both Ken and Linda. What defense \nhas Linda? \n4. The FCRA requires that credit-reporting agencies “follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum \npossible accuracy of the information.” In October of 1989, Renie Guimond became aware of, and notified \nthe credit bureau Trans Union about, inaccuracies in her credit report: that she was married (and it listed a \nSocial Security number for this nonexistent spouse), that she was also known as Ruth Guimond, and that \nshe had a Saks Fifth Avenue credit card. About a month later, Trans Union responded to Guimond’s letter, \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1016 \nstating that the erroneous information had been removed. But in March of 1990, Trans Union again \npublished the erroneous information it purportedly had removed. Guimond then requested the source of \nthe erroneous information, to which Trans Union responded that it could not disclose the identity of the \nsource because it did not know its source. The disputed information was eventually removed from \nGuimond’s file in October 1990. When Guimond sued, Trans Union defended that she had no claim because \nno credit was denied to her as a result of the inaccuracies in her credit file. The lower court dismissed her \ncase; she appealed. To what damages, if any, is Guimond entitled? \n5. Plaintiff incurred a medical debt of $160.

A signature loan is merely a written promise by the debtor \nto repay, but the creditor stuck holding a promissory note with a signature loan only—while he may sue a \ndefaulting debtor—will get nothing if the debtor is insolvent. Again, that’s no security at all. Real security \nfor the creditor comes in two forms: by agreement with the debtor or by operation of law without an \nagreement. \n \nBy Agreement with the Debtor \nSecurity obtained through agreement comes in three major types: (1) personal property security (the most \ncommon form of security); (2) suretyship—the willingness of a third party to pay if the primarily obligated \nparty does not; and (3) mortgage of real estate. \n \nBy Operation of Law \nSecurity obtained through operation of law is known as a lien. Derived from the French for “string” or \n“tie,” a lien is the legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another in order to secure payment or \ndischarge an obligation. \n \nIn this chapter, we take up security interests in personal property and suretyship. In the next chapter, we \nlook at mortgages and nonconsensual liens. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1020 \n \nBasics of Secured Transactions \nThe law of secured transactions consists of five principal components: (1) the nature of property that can \nbe the subject of a security interest; (2) the methods of creating the security interest; (3) the perfection of \nthe security interest against claims of others; (4) priorities among secured and unsecured creditors—that \nis, who will be entitled to the secured property if more than one person asserts a legal right to it; and (5) \nthe rights of creditors when the debtor defaults. After considering the source of the law and some key \nterminology, we examine each of these components in turn. \nHere is the simplest (and most common) scenario: Debtor borrows money or obtains credit from Creditor, \nsigns a note and security agreement putting up collateral, and promises to pay the debt or, upon Debtor’s \ndefault, let Creditor (secured party) take possession of (repossess) the collateral and sell it. Figure 25.1 \n\"The Grasping Hand\" illustrates this scenario—the grasping hand is Creditor’s reach for the collateral, but \nthe hand will not close around the collateral and take it (repossess) unless Debtor defaults. \n \nFigure 25.1 The Grasping Hand \n \n \nSource of Law and Definitions \nSource of Law \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1021 \nArticle 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs security interests in personal property. The \nUCC defines the scope of the article (here slightly truncated): [1] \n \nThis chapter applies to the following: \n1. A transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or \nfixtures by contract; \n2. An agricultural lien; \n3. A sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; \n4. A consignment… \n \nDefinitions \nAs always, it is necessary to review some definitions so that communication on the topic at hand is \npossible. The secured transaction always involves a debtor, a secured party, a security agreement, a \nsecurity interest, and collateral. \n \nArticle 9 applies to any transaction “that creates a security interest.” The UCC in Section 1-201(35) \ndefines security interest as “an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or \nperformance of an obligation.” \n \nSecurity agreement is “an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest.” It is the contract \nthat sets up the debtor’s duties and the creditor’s rights in event the debtor defaults. [2] \n \nCollateral “means the property subject to a security interest or agricultural lien.” [3] \n \nPurchase-money security interest (PMSI) is the simplest form of security interest. Section 9-103(a) \nof the UCC defines “purchase-money collateral” as “goods or software that secures a purchase-money \nobligation with respect to that collateral.” A PMSI arises where the debtor gets credit to buy goods and the \ncreditor takes a secured interest in those goods. Suppose you want to buy a big hardbound textbook on \ncredit at your college bookstore. The manager refuses to extend you credit outright but says she will take \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1022 \nback a PMSI. In other words, she will retain a security interest in the book itself, and if you don’t pay, \nyou’ll have to return the book; it will be repossessed. Contrast this situation with a counteroffer you might \nmake: because she tells you not to mark up the book (in the event that she has to repossess it if you \ndefault), you would rather give her some other collateral to hold—for example, your gold college signet \nring. Her security interest in the ring is not a PMSI but a pledge; a PMSI must be an interest in the \nparticular goods purchased. A PMSI would also be created if you borrowed money to buy the book and \ngave the lender a security interest in the book.",

As before, Behnfeldt is the debtor and an obligor. As an accommodation party, \nBruno is a secondary obligor. Bruno has this status even if the note states that her obligation is a primary \nobligation and that she waives all suretyship defenses.” \n \nAgain, usually the debtor is the obligor, but consider example 3 from the same Official Comment: \n“Behnfeldt borrows money on an unsecured basis. Bruno cosigns the note and grants a security interest in \nher Honda to secure her [Behnfeldt’s] obligation.

Collateral is—again—property that \nis subject to the security interest. It can be divided into four broad categories: goods, intangible property, \nindispensable paper, and other types of collateral. \n \nGoods \nTangible property as collateral is goods. Goods means “all things that are movable when a security interest \nattaches. The term includes (i) fixtures, (ii) standing timber that is to be cut and removed under a \nconveyance or contract for sale, (iii) the unborn young of animals, (iv) crops grown, growing, or to be \ngrown, even if the crops are produced on trees, vines, or bushes, and (v) manufactured homes. The term \nalso includes a computer program embedded in goods.” [8] Goods are divided into several subcategories; \nsix are taken up here. \n \nConsumer Goods \nThese are “goods used or bought primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” [9] \n \nInventory \n“Goods, other than farm products, held by a person for sale or lease or consisting of raw materials, works \nin progress, or material consumed in a business.” [10] \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1025 \n \nFarm Products \n“Crops, livestock, or other supplies produced or used in farming operations,” including aquatic goods \nproduced in aquaculture. [11] \n \nEquipment \nThis is the residual category, defined as “goods other than inventory, farm products, or consumer \ngoods.” [12] \n \nFixtures \nThese are “goods that have become so related to particular real property that an interest in them arises \nunder real property law.” [13] Examples would be windows, furnaces, central air conditioning, and \nplumbing fixtures—items that, if removed, would be a cause for significant reconstruction. \n \nAccession \nThese are “goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the \noriginal goods is lost.” [14] A new engine installed in an old automobile is an accession. \n \nIntangible Property \nTwo types of collateral are neither goods nor indispensible paper: accounts and general intangibles. \n \nAccounts \nThis type of intangible property includes accounts receivable (the right to payment of money), insurance \npolicy proceeds, energy provided or to be provided, winnings in a lottery, health-care-insurance \nreceivables, promissory notes, securities, letters of credit, and interests in business entities. [15] Often there \nis something in writing to show the existence of the right—such as a right to receive the proceeds of \nsomebody else’s insurance payout—but the writing is merely evidence of the right. The paper itself doesn’t \nhave to be delivered for the transfer of the right to be effective; that’s done by assignment. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1026 \nGeneral Intangibles \nGeneral intangibles refers to “any personal property, including things in action, other than accounts, \ncommercial tort claims, deposit accounts, documents, goods, instruments, investment property, letter-of-\ncredit rights, letters of credit, money, and oil, gas, or other minerals before extraction.” General \nintangibles include payment intangibles and software.

Here the security agreement calls for the collateral to stand for both present \nand future advances of credit without any additional paperwork. \n \nHere are examples of future advances: \n \no \nExample 1: A debtor enters into a security agreement with a creditor that contains a \nfuture advances clause. The agreement gives the creditor a security interest in a \n$700,000 inventory-picking robot to secure repayment of a loan made to the debtor. The \nparties contemplate that the debtor will, from time to time, borrow more money, and \nwhen the debtor does, the machine will stand as collateral to secure the further \nindebtedness, without new paperwork. \no \nExample 2: A debtor signs a security agreement with a bank to buy a car. The security \nagreement contains a future advances clause. A few years later, the bank sends the debtor \na credit card. Two years go by: the car is paid for, but the credit card is in default. The \nbank seizes the car. “Whoa!” says the debtor. “I paid for the car.” “Yes,” says the bank, \n“but it was collateral for all future indebtedness you ran up with us. Check out your loan \nagreement with us and UCC Section 9-204(c), especially Comment 5.” \n \nSee Figure 25.2 \"Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral\". \n \n \n \nFigure 25.2 Tangibles and Intangibles as Collateral \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1029 \n \n \nAttachment of the Security Interest \nIn General \nAttachment is the term used to describe when a security interest becomes enforceable against the debtor \nwith respect to the collateral. In Figure 25.1 \"The Grasping Hand\", ”Attachment” is the outreached hand \nthat is prepared, if the debtor defaults, to grasp the collateral. [21] \n \nRequirements for Attachment \nThere are three requirements for attachment: (1) the secured party gives value; (2) the debtor has rights in \nthe collateral or the power to transfer rights in it to the secured party; (3) the parties have a security \nagreement “authenticated” (signed) by the debtor, or the creditor has possession of the collateral. \n \n \n \nCreditor Gives Value \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1030 \nThe creditor, or secured party, must give “value” for the security interest to attach. The UCC, in Section 1-\n204, provides that \n \na person gives ‘value’ for rights if he acquires them \n \n(1) in return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately \navailable credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in \nthe event of difficulties in collection; or \n \n(2) as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim; or \n \n(3) by accepting delivery pursuant to a pre-existing contract for purchase; or \n \n(4) generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. \n \nSuppose Deborah owes Carl $3,000. She cannot repay the sum when due, so she agrees to give Carl a \nsecurity interest in her automobile to the extent of $3,000 in return for an extension of the time to pay. \nThat is sufficient value. \n \nDebtor’s Rights in Collateral \nThe debtor must have rights in the collateral. Most commonly, the debtor owns the collateral (or has some \nownership interest in it). The rights need not necessarily be the immediate right to possession, but they \nmust be rights that can be conveyed. [22] A person can’t put up as collateral property she doesn’t own. \n \nSecurity Agreement (Contract) or Possession of Collateral by Creditor \nThe debtor most often signs the written security agreement, or contract. The UCC says that “the debtor \n[must have] authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral.…” \n“Authenticating” (or “signing,” “adopting,” or “accepting”) means to sign or, in recognition of electronic \ncommercial transactions, “to execute or otherwise adopt a symbol, or encrypt or similarly process a \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1031 \nrecord…with the present intent of the authenticating person to identify the person and adopt or accept a \nrecord.” The “record” is the modern UCC’s substitution for the term “writing.” It includes information \nelectronically stored or on paper. [23] \n \nThe “authenticating record” (the signed security agreement) is not required in some cases. It is not \nrequired if the debtor makes a pledge of the collateral—that is, delivers it to the creditor for the creditor \nto possess. For example, upon a creditor’s request of a debtor for collateral to secure a loan of $3,000, the \ndebtor offers up his stamp collection. The creditor says, “Fine, have it appraised (at your expense) and \nshow me the appraisal. If it comes in at $3,000 or more, I’ll take your stamp collection and lock it in my \nsafe until you’ve repaid me. If you don’t repay me, I’ll sell it.” A creditor could take possession of any \ngoods and various kinds of paper, tangible or intangible. In commercial transactions, it would be common",

When the debtor’s obligation is satisfied, \nthe secured party files a termination statement if the collateral was consumer goods; otherwise—upon \ndemand—the secured party sends the debtor a termination statement. [32] \n \nDebtor Moves out of State \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1034 \nThe UCC also has rules for continued perfection of security interests when the debtor—whether an \nindividual or an association (corporation)—moves from one state to another. Generally, an interest \nremains perfected until the earlier of when the perfection would have expired or for four months after the \ndebtor moves to a new jurisdiction. [33] \n \nWhere to File the Financing Statement \nFor most real-estate-related filings—ore to be extracted from mines, agricultural collateral, and fixtures—\nthe place to file is with the local office that files mortgages, typically the county auditor’s office. [34] For \nother collateral, the filing place is as duly authorized by the state. In some states, that is the office of the \nSecretary of State; in others, it is the Department of Licensing; or it might be a private party that \nmaintains the state’s filing system. [35] The filing should be made in the state where the debtor has his or \nher primary residence for individuals, and in the state where the debtor is organized if it is a registered \norganization. [36] The point is, creditors need to know where to look to see if the collateral offered up is \nalready encumbered. In any event, filing the statement in more than one place can’t hurt. The filing office \nwill provide instructions on how to file; these are available online, and electronic filing is usually available \nfor at least some types of collateral. \n \nExemptions \nSome transactions are exempt from the filing provision. The most important category of exempt collateral \nis that covered by state certificate of title laws. For example, many states require automobile owners to \nobtain a certificate of title from the state motor vehicle office. Most of these states provide that it is not \nnecessary to file a financing statement in order to perfect a security interest in an automobile. The reason \nis that the motor vehicle regulations require any security interests to be stated on the title, so that anyone \nattempting to buy a car in which a security interest had been created would be on notice when he took the \nactual title certificate. [37] \n \nTemporary Perfection \nThe UCC provides that certain types of collateral are automatically perfected but only for a while: “A \nsecurity interest in certificated securities, or negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1035 \nfiling or the taking of possession for a period of twenty days from the time it attaches to the extent that it \narises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement.”[38] Similar temporary perfection \ncovers negotiable documents or goods in possession of a bailee, and when a security certificate or \ninstrument is delivered to the debtor for sale, exchange, presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or \nregistration. [39] After the twenty-day period, perfection would have to be by one of the other methods \nmentioned here. \n \nPerfection by Possession \nA secured party may perfect the security interest by possession where the collateral is negotiable \ndocuments, goods, instruments, money, tangible chattel paper, or certified securities. [40] This is a pledge \nof assets (mentioned in the example of the stamp collection). No security agreement is required for \nperfection by possession. \n \nA variation on the theme of pledge is field warehousing. When the pawnbroker lends money, he takes \npossession of the goods—the watch, the ring, the camera. But when large manufacturing concerns wish to \nborrow against their inventory, taking physical possession is not necessarily so easy. The bank does not \nwish to have shipped to its Wall Street office several tons of copper mined in Colorado. Bank employees \nperhaps could go west to the mine and take physical control of the copper, but banks are unlikely to \nemploy people and equipment necessary to build a warehouse on the spot. Thus this so-called field pledge \nis rare. \n \nMore common is the field warehouse. The field warehouse can take one of two forms. An independent \ncompany can go to the site and put up a temporary structure—for example, a fence around the copper—\nthus establishing physical control of the collateral. Or the independent company can lease the warehouse \nfacilities of the debtor and post signs indicating that the goods inside are within its sale custody. Either \nway, the goods are within the physical possession of the field warehouse service. The field warehouse then \nsegregates the goods secured to the particular bank or finance company and issues a warehouse receipt to",

            "chunk": "with nothing. Here we take up the general rule and the exceptions. \n \nGeneral Rule \nThe general rule regarding priorities is, to use a quotation attributed to a Southern Civil War general, the \none who wins “gets there firstest with the mostest.” The first to do the best job of perfecting wins. The \nUniform Commercial Code (UCC) creates a race of diligence among competitors. \n \nApplication of the Rule \nIf both parties have perfected, the first to perfect wins. If one has perfected and one attached, the \nperfected party wins. If both have attached without perfection, the first to attach wins. If neither has \nattached, they are unsecured creditors. Let’s test this general rule against the following situations: \n \n1. Rosemary, without having yet lent money, files a financing statement on February 1 covering certain \ncollateral owned by Susan—Susan’s fur coat. Under UCC Article 9, a filing may be made before the \nsecurity interest attaches. On March 1, Erika files a similar statement, also without having lent any \nmoney. On April 1, Erika loans Susan $1,000, the loan being secured by the fur coat described in the \nstatement she filed on March 1. On May 1, Rosemary also loans Susan $1,000, with the same fur coat \nas security. Who has priority? Rosemary does, since she filed first, even though Erika actually first \nextended the loan, which was perfected when made (because she had already filed). This result is \ndictated by the rule even though Rosemary may have known of Erika’s interest when she \nsubsequently made her loan. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1041 \n2. Susan cajoles both Rosemary and Erika, each unknown to the other, to loan her $1,000 secured by \nthe fur coat, which she already owns and which hangs in her coat closet. Erika gives Susan the money \na week after Rosemary, but Rosemary has not perfected and Erika does not either. A week later, they \nfind out they have each made a loan against the same coat. Who has priority? Whoever perfects first: \nthe rule creates a race to the filing office or to Susan’s closet. Whoever can submit the financing \nstatement or actually take possession of the coat first will have priority, and the outcome does not \ndepend on knowledge or lack of knowledge that someone else is claiming a security interest in the \nsame collateral. But what of the rule that in the absence of perfection, whichever security interest \nfirst attached has priority? This is “thought to be of merely theoretical interest,” says the UCC \ncommentary, “since it is hard to imagine a situation where the case would come into litigation \nwithout [either party] having perfected his interest.” And if the debtor filed a petition in bankruptcy, \nneither unperfected security interest could prevail against the bankruptcy trustee. \n \nTo rephrase: An attached security interest prevails over other unsecured creditors (unsecured creditors \nlose to secured creditors, perfected or unperfected). If both parties are secured (have attached the \ninterest), the first to perfect wins. [1] If both parties have perfected, the first to have perfected wins. [2] \n \nExceptions to the General Rule \nThere are three immediate exceptions to the general rule, and several other exceptions, all of which—\nactually—make some straightforward sense even if it sounds a little complicated to explain them. \n \nImmediate Exceptions \nWe call the following three exceptions “immediate” ones because they allow junior filers immediate \npriority to take their collateral before the debtor’s other creditors get it. They all involve purchase-money \nsecurity interests (PMSIs), so if the debtor defaults, the creditor repossesses the very goods the creditor \nhad sold the debtor. \n \n(1) Purchase-money security interest in goods (other than inventory or livestock). The UCC provides that \n“a perfected purchase-money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1042 \na conflicting security interest in the same goods…if the purchase-money security interest is perfected \nwhen debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter.” [3] The Official Comment to \nthis UCC section observes that “in most cases, priority will be over a security interest asserted under an \nafter-acquired property clause.” \n \nSuppose Susan manufactures fur coats. On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would",

On February 1, Rosemary advances her $10,000 under a security \nagreement covering all Susan’s machinery and containing an after-acquired property clause. Rosemary \nfiles a financing statement that same day. On March 1, Susan buys a new machine from Erika for $5,000 \nand gives her a security interest in the machine; Erika files a financing statement within twenty days of \nthe time that the machine is delivered to Susan. Who has priority if Susan defaults on her loan payments? \nUnder the PMSI rule, Erika has priority, because she had a PMSI. Suppose, however, that Susan had not \nbought the machine from Erika but had merely given her a security interest in it. Then Rosemary would \nhave priority, because her filing was prior to Erika’s. \n \nWhat would happen if this kind of PMSI in noninventory goods (here, equipment) did not get priority \nstatus? A prudent Erika would not extend credit to Susan at all, and if the new machine is necessary for \nSusan’s business, she would soon be out of business. That certainly would not inure to the benefit of \nRosemary. It is, mostly, to Rosemary’s advantage that Susan gets the machine: it enhances Susan’s ability \nto make money to pay Rosemary. \n \n(2) Purchase-money security interest in inventory. The UCC provides that a perfected PMSI in inventory \nhas priority over conflicting interests in the same inventory, provided that the PMSI is perfected when the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, the PMSI-secured party sends an authenticated notification \nto the holder of the conflicting interest and that person receives the notice within five years before the \ndebtor receives possession of the inventory, and the notice states that the person sending it has or expects \nto acquire a PMSI in the inventory and describes the inventory. [4] The notice requirement is aimed at \nprotecting a secured party in the typical situation in which incoming inventory is subject to a prior \nagreement to make advances against it. If the original creditor gets notice that new inventory is subject to \na PMSI, he will be forewarned against making an advance on it; if he does not receive notice, he will have \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1043 \npriority. It is usually to the earlier creditor’s advantage that her debtor is able to get credit to “floor” \n(provide) inventory, without selling which, of course, the debtor cannot pay back the earlier creditor. \n \n(3) Purchase-money security interest in fixtures. Under UCC Section 9-334(e), a perfected security in \nfixtures has priority over a mortgage if the security interest is a PMSI and the security interest is perfected \nby a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days after. A mortgagee is usually a \nbank (the mortgagor is the owner of the real estate, subject to the mortgagee’s interest). The bank’s \nmortgage covers the real estate and fixtures, even fixtures added after the date of the mortgage (after-\nacquired property clause). In accord with the general rule, then, the mortgagee/bank would normally have \npriority if the mortgage is recorded first, as would a fixture filing if made before the mortgage was \nrecorded. But with the exception noted, the bank’s interest is subordinate to the fixture-seller’s later-\nperfected PMSI. Example: Susan buys a new furnace from Heating Co. to put in her house. Susan gave a \nbank a thirty-year mortgage on the house ten years before. Heating Co. takes back a PMSI and files the \nappropriate financing statement before or within twenty days of installation. If Susan defaults on her loan \nto the bank, Heating Co. would take priority over the bank. And why not? The mortgagee has, in the long \nrun, benefited from the improvement and modernization of the real estate. (Again, there are further \nnuances in Section 9-334 beyond our scope here.) A non-PMSI in fixtures or PMSIs perfected more than \ntwenty days after goods become a fixture loses out to prior recorded interests in the realty. \n \nOther Exceptions \nWe have noted the three immediate exceptions to the general rule that “the firstest with the mostest” \nprevails. There are some other exceptions. \n \nThink about how these other exceptions might arise: who might want to take property subject to a security \nagreement (not including thieves)? That is, Debtor gives Creditor a security interest in, say, goods, while \nretaining possession. First, buyers of various sorts might want the goods if they paid for them; they \nusually win. Second, lien creditors might want the goods (a lien creditor is one whose claim is based on \noperation of law—involuntarily against Debtor, and including a trustee in bankruptcy—as opposed to one \nwhose claim is based on agreement); lien creditors may be statutory (landlords, mechanics, bailees) or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1044 \njudicial.

Third, a bankruptcy trustee representing Debtor’s creditors (independent of the trustee’s role as \na lien creditor) might want to take the goods to sell and satisfy Debtor’s obligations to the creditors. \nFourth, unsecured creditors; fifth, secured creditors; and sixth, secured and perfected creditors. We will \nexamine some of the possible permutations but are compelled to observe that this area of law has many \nfine nuances, not all of which can be taken up here. \n \nFirst we look at buyers who take priority over, or free of, unperfected security interests. Buyers who take \ndelivery of many types of collateral covered by anunperfected security interest win out over the hapless \nsecured party who failed to perfect if they give value and don’t know of the security interest or agricultural \nlien. [5] A buyer who doesn’t give value or who knows of the security interest will not win out, nor will a \nbuyer prevail if the seller’s creditor files a financing statement before or within twenty days after the \ndebtor receives delivery of the collateral. \n \nNow we look at buyers who take priority over perfected security interests. Sometimes people who buy \nthings even covered by a perfected security interest win out (the perfected secured party loses). \n \n• \nBuyers in the ordinary course of business. “A buyer in the ordinary course of business, other than \n[one buying farm products from somebody engaged in farming] takes free of a security interest \ncreated by the buyer’s seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows \n[it].” [6] Here the buyer is usually purchasing inventory collateral, and it’s OK if he knows the \ninventory is covered by a security interest, but it’s not OK if he knows “that the sale violates a term \nin an agreement with the secured party.” [7] It would not be conducive to faith in commercial \ntransactions if buyers of inventory generally had to worry whether their seller’s creditors were \ngoing to repossess the things the buyers had purchased in good faith. For example (based on \nexample 1 to the same comment, UCC 9-320, Official Comment 3), Manufacturer makes \nappliances and owns manufacturing equipment covered by a perfected security agreement in \nfavor of Lender. Manufacturer sells the equipment to Dealer, whose business is buying and selling \nused equipment; Dealer, in turn, sells the stuff to Buyer, a buyer in the ordinary course. Does \nBuyer take free of the security interest? No, because Dealer didn’t create it; Manufacturer did. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1045 \n• \nBuyers of consumer goods purchased for personal, family, or household use take free of security \ninterests, even if perfected, so long as they buy without knowledge of the security interest, for \nvalue, for their own consumer uses, and before the filing of a financing statement covering the \ngoods. This—again—is the rub when a seller of consumer goods perfects by “mere attachment” \n(automatic perfection) and the buyer of the goods turns around and sells them. For example, Tom \nbuys a new refrigerator from Sears, which perfects by mere attachment. Tom has cash flow \nproblems and sells the fridge to Ned, his neighbor. Ned doesn’t know about Sears’s security \ninterest and pays a reasonable amount for it. He puts it in his kitchen for home use. Sears cannot \nrepossess the fridge from Ned. If it wanted to protect itself fully, Sears would have filed a \nfinancing statement; then Ned would be out the fridge when the repo men came. [8] The “value” \nissue is interestingly presented in the Nicolosi case (Section 25.5 \"Cases\"). \n• \nBuyers of farm products. The UCC itself does not protect buyers of farm products from security \ninterests created by “the person engaged in farming operations who is in the business of selling \nfarm products,” and the result was that sometimes the buyer had to pay twice: once to the farmer \nand again to the lender whom the farmer didn’t pay. As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors",

As a result, Congress included in its 1985 \nFarm Security Act, 7 USC 1631, Section 1324, this language: “A buyer who in the ordinary course \nof business buys a farm product from a seller engaged in farming operations shall take free of a \nsecurity interest created by the seller, even though the security interest is perfected; and the buyer \nknows of the existence of such interest.” \n \nThere are some other exceptions, beyond our scope here. \n \nLien Creditors \nPersons (including bankruptcy trustees) who become lien creditors before the security interest is \nperfected win out—the unperfected security interest is subordinate to lien creditors. Persons who become \nlien creditors after the security interest is perfected lose (subject to some nuances in situations where the \nlien arises between attachment by the creditor and the filing, and depending upon the type of security \ninterest and the type of collateral). [9] More straightforwardly, perhaps, a lien securing payment or \nperformance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1046 \nordinary course of business has priority over other security interests (unless a statute provides \notherwise). [10] This is the bailee or “material man” (one who supplies materials, as to build a house) with a \nlien situation. Garage Mechanic repairs a car in which Owner has previously given a perfected security \ninterest to Bank. Owner doesn’t pay Bank. Bank seeks to repossess the car from Mechanic. It will have to \npay the Mechanic first. And why not? If the car was not running, Bank would have to have it repaired \nanyway. \n \nBankruptcy Trustee \nTo what extent can the bankruptcy trustee take property previously encumbered by a security interest? It \ndepends. If the security interest was not perfected at the time of filing for bankruptcy, the trustee can take \nthe collateral.[11] If it was perfected, the trustee can’t take it, subject to rules on preferential transfers: the \nBankruptcy Act provides that the trustee can avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property—\nincluding a security interest—(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor, (2) on or account of an antecedent debt, \n(3) made while the debtor was insolvent, (4) within ninety days of the bankruptcy petition date (or one \nyear, for “insiders”—like relatives or business partners), (5) which enables the creditor to receive more \nthan it would have in the bankruptcy. [12]There are further bankruptcy details beyond our scope here, but \nthe short of it is that sometimes creditors who think they have a valid, enforceable security interest find \nout that the bankruptcy trustee has snatched the collateral away from them. \n \nDeposit accounts perfected by control. A security interest in a deposit account (checking account, savings \naccount, money-market account, certificate of deposit) takes priority over security interests in the account \nperfected by other means, and under UCC Section 9-327(3), a bank with which the deposit is made takes \npriority over all other conflicting security agreements. [13] For example, a debtor enters into a security \nagreement with his sailboat as collateral. The creditor perfects. The debtor sells the sailboat and deposits \nthe proceeds in his account with a bank; normally, the creditor’s interest would attach to the proceeds. \nThe debtor next borrows money from the bank, and the bank takes a security interest in the debtor’s \naccount by control. The debtor defaults. Who gets the money representing the sailboat’s proceeds? The \nbank does. The rationale: “this…enables banks to extend credit to their depositors without the need to \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1047 \nexamine [records] to determine whether another party might have a security interest in the deposit \naccount.” [14] \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nWho among competing creditors gets the collateral if the debtor defaults? The general rule on priorities is \nthat the first to secure most completely wins: if all competitors have perfected, the first to do so wins. If one \nhas perfected and the others have not, the one who perfects wins. If all have attached, the first to attach wins. \nIf none have attached, they’re all unsecured creditors. To this general rule there are a number of exceptions. \nPurchase-money security interests in goods and inventory prevail over previously perfected secured parties in \nthe same goods and inventory (subject to some requirements); fixture financers who file properly have \npriority over previously perfected mortgagees. Buyers in the ordinary course of business take free of a security \ninterest created by their seller, so long as they don’t know their purchase violates a security agreement.",

[Citation] “Chrysler enjoyed a limited privilege to enter [the \nplaintiff’s] property for the sole and exclusive purpose of effectuating the repossession. So long as the \nentry was limited in purpose (repossession), and so long as no gates, barricades, doors, enclosures, \nbuildings, or chains were breached or cut, no breach of the peace occurred by virtue of the entry onto his \nproperty.” \n \n…[W]e come to essentially the same conclusion: where a repossession is effectuated by an actual breaking \ninto the lessee/debtor’s premises or breaching or cutting of chains, gates, barricades, doors or other \nbarriers designed to exclude trespassers, the likelihood that a breach of the peace occurred is high. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1069 \nDavenport v. Chrysler Credit Corp., [Citation] (Tenn.App.1991), a case analyzing Tennessee’s version of \nsection 9-503 is particularly helpful, holding that “‘[a] breach of the peace is almost certain to be found if \nthe repossession is accompanied by the unauthorized entry into a closed or locked garage.’”…This is so \nbecause “public policy favors peaceful, non-trespassory repossessions when the secured party has a free \nright of entry” and “forced entries onto the debtor’s property or into the debtor’s premises are viewed as \nseriously detrimental to the ordinary conduct of human affairs.” Davenport held that the creditor’s \nrepossession of a car by entering a closed garage and cutting a chain that would have prevented it from \nremoving the car amounted to a breach of the peace, “[d]espite the absence of violence or physical \nconfrontation” (because the debtor was not at home when the repossession \noccurred).Davenport recognized that the secured creditors’ legitimate interest in obtaining possession of \ncollateral without having to resort to expensive and cumbersome judicial procedures must be balanced \nagainst the debtors’ legitimate interest in being free from unwarranted invasions of their property and \nprivacy interests. \n \n“Repossession is a harsh procedure and is, essentially, a delegation of the State’s exclusive prerogative to \nresolve disputes. Accordingly, the statutes governing the repossession of collateral should be construed in \na way that prevents abuse and discourages illegal conduct which might otherwise go unchallenged \nbecause of the debtor’s lack of knowledge of legally proper repossession techniques” [Citation].",

Article 9 lumps together all the former types of security devices, including the pledge, chattel \nmortgage, and conditional sale. \nFive types of tangible property may serve as collateral: (1) consumer goods, (2) equipment, (3) farm \nproducts, (4) inventory, and (5) fixtures. Five types of intangibles may serve as collateral: (1) accounts, (2) \ngeneral intangibles (e.g., patents), (3) documents of title, (4) chattel paper, and (5) instruments. Article 9 \nexpressly permits the debtor to give a security interest in after-acquired collateral. \n \nTo create an enforceable security interest, the lender and borrower must enter into an agreement \nestablishing the interest, and the lender must follow steps to ensure that the security interest first attaches \nand then is perfected. There are three general requirements for attachment: (1) there must be an \nauthenticated agreement (or the collateral must physically be in the lender’s possession), (2) the lender \nmust have given value, and (3) the debtor must have some rights in the collateral. Once the interest \nattaches, the lender has rights in the collateral superior to those of unsecured creditors. But others may \ndefeat his interest unless he perfects the security interest. The three common ways of doing so are (1) \nfiling a financing statement, (2) pledging collateral, and (3) taking a purchase-money security interest \n(PMSI) in consumer goods. \n \nA financing statement is a simple notice, showing the parties’ names and addresses, the signature of the \ndebtor, and an adequate description of the collateral. The financing statement, effective for five years, \nmust be filed in a public office; the location of the office varies among the states. \n \nSecurity interests in instruments and negotiable documents can be perfected only by the secured party’s \ntaking possession, with twenty-one-day grace periods applicable under certain circumstances. Goods may \nalso be secured through pledging, which is often done through field warehousing. If a seller of consumer \ngoods takes a PMSI in the goods sold, then perfection is automatic and no filing is required, although the \nlender may file and probably should, to avoid losing seniority to a bona fide purchaser of consumer goods \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1075 \nwithout knowledge of the security interest, if the goods are used for personal, family, or household \npurposes. \n \nThe general priority rule is “first in time, first in right.” Priority dates from the earlier of two events: (1) \nfiling a financing statement covering the collateral or (2) other perfection of the security interest. Several \nexceptions to this rule arise when creditors take a PMSI, among them, when a buyer in the ordinary \ncourse of business takes free of a security interest created by the seller. \n \nOn default, a creditor may repossess the collateral. For the most part, self-help private repossession \ncontinues to be lawful but risky. After repossession, the lender may sell the collateral or accept it in \nsatisfaction of the debt. Any excess in the selling price above the debt amount must go to the debtor. \n \nSuretyship is a legal relationship that is created when one person contracts to be responsible for the \nproper fulfillment of another’s obligation, in case the latter (the principal debtor) fails to fulfill it. The \nsurety may avail itself of the principal’s contract defenses, but under various circumstances, defenses may \nbe available to the one that are not available to the other. One general defense often raised by sureties is \nalteration of the contract. If the surety is required to perform, it has rights for reimbursement against the \nprincipal, including interest and legal fees; and if there is more than one surety, each standing for part of \nthe obligation, one who pays a disproportionate part may seek contribution from the others. \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1 \nKathy Knittle borrowed $20,000 from Bank to buy inventory to sell in her knit shop and signed a security \nagreement listing as collateral the entire present and future inventory in the shop, including proceeds",

A long time ago, the mortgage was considered \nan actual transfer of title, to become void if the debt was paid off. The modern view, held in most states, is \nthat the mortgage is but a lien, giving the holder, in the event of default, the right to sell the property and \nrepay the debt from the proceeds. The person giving the mortgage is the mortgagor, or borrower. In the \ntypical home purchase, that’s the buyer. The buyer needs to borrow to finance the purchase; in exchange \nfor the money with which to pay the seller, the buyer “takes out a mortgage” with, say, a bank. The lender \nis the mortgagee, the person or institution holding the mortgage, with the right to foreclose on the \nproperty if the debt is not timely paid. Although the law of real estate mortgages is different from the set \nof rules in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) that we examined in Chapter 25 \"Secured \nTransactions and Suretyship\", the circumstances are the same, except that the security is real estate rather \nthan personal property (secured transactions) or the promise of another (suretyship). \n \nThe Uses of Mortgages \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1081 \nMost frequently, we think of a mortgage as a device to fund a real estate purchase: for a homeowner to \nbuy her house, or for a commercial entity to buy real estate (e.g., an office building), or for a person to \npurchase farmland. But the value in real estate can be mortgaged for almost any purpose (a home equity \nloan): a person can take out a mortgage on land to fund a vacation. Indeed, during the period leading up \nto the recession in 2007–08, a lot of people borrowed money on their houses to buy things: boats, new \ncars, furniture, and so on. Unfortunately, it turned out that some of the real estate used as collateral was \novervalued: when the economy weakened and people lost income or their jobs, they couldn’t make the \nmortgage payments. And, to make things worse, the value of the real estate sometimes sank too, so that \nthe debtors owed more on the property than it was worth (that’s called being underwater). They couldn’t \nsell without taking a loss, and they couldn’t make the payments. Some debtors just walked away, leaving",

FL 2002) \n \nBackground \n \n[Paul Cherry filed a complaint suing Chase for Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violations and slander of \ncredit.]…Chase counter-claimed for foreclosure and reestablishment of the lost note.… \n \n…Chase held a mortgage on Cherry’s home to which Cherry made timely payments until August 2000. \nCherry stopped making payments on the mortgage after he received a letter from Chase acknowledging \nhis satisfaction of the mortgage. Cherry notified Chase of the error through a customer service \nrepresentative. Cherry, however, received a check dated August 15, 2000, as an escrow refund on the \nmortgage. Chase subsequently recorded a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the Pinellas County public records \non October 19, 2000. On November 14, 2000, Chase sent Cherry a “Loan Reactivation” letter with a new \nloan number upon which to make the payments. During this time, Cherry was placing his mortgage \npayments into a bank account, which subsequently were put into an escrow account maintained by his \nattorney. These payments were not, and have not, been tendered to Chase. As a result of the failure to \ntender, Chase sent Cherry an acceleration warning on November 17, 2000, and again on March 16, 2001. \nChase notified the credit bureaus as to Cherry’s default status and moved for foreclosure. In a letter \naddressed to Cherry’s attorney, dated April 24, 2001, Chase’s attorney advised Cherry to make the \nmortgage payments to Chase. Chase recorded a “vacatur, revocation, and cancellation of satisfaction of \nmortgage” (vacatur) [vacatur: an announcement filed in court that something is cancelled or set aside; an \nannulment] in the Pinellas County public records on May 3, 2001. Chase signed the vacatur on March 21, \n2001, and had it notarized on March 27, 2001. Chase has also been unable to locate the original note, \ndated October 15, 1997, and deems it to be lost.… \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1100 \n \nForeclosure \n \nChase accelerated Cherry’s mortgage debt after determining he was in a default status under the mortgage \nprovisions. Chase claims that the right to foreclose under the note and mortgage is “absolute,” [Citation], \nand that this Court should enforce the security interest in the mortgage though Chase made an \nadministrative error in entering a Satisfaction of Mortgage into the public records.… \n \nMortgage \n \n…Chase relies on the Florida Supreme Court decision in United Service Corp. v. Vi-An Const. Corp., \n[Citation] (Fla.1955), which held that a Satisfaction of Mortgage “made through a mistake may be \ncanceled” and a mortgage reestablished as long as no other innocent third parties have “acquired an \ninterest in the property.” Generally the court looks to the rights of any innocent third parties, and if none \nexist, equity will grant relief to a mortgagee who has mistakenly satisfied a mortgage before fully paid. \n[Citation]. Both parties agree that the mortgage was released before the debt was fully paid. Neither party \nhas presented any facts to this Court that implies the possibility nor existence of a third party interest. \nAlthough Cherry argues under Biggs v. Smith, 184 So. 106, 107 (1938), that a recorded satisfaction of \nmortgage is “prima facie evidence of extinguishment of a mortgage lien,” Biggs does not apply this \nstandard to mortgage rights affected by a mistake in the satisfaction. \n \nTherefore, on these facts, this Court acknowledges that a vacatur is a proper remedy for Chase to correct \nits unilateral mistake since “equity will grant relief to those who have through mistake released a \nmortgage.” [Citation.] Accordingly, this Court holds that an equity action is required to make a vacatur \nenforceable unless the parties consent to the vacatur or a similar remedy during the mortgage \nnegotiation.… \n \nTender \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1101 \nCherry has not made a mortgage payment to Chase since August 2000, but claims to have made these \npayments into an escrow account, which he claims were paid to the escrow account because Chase \nrecorded a satisfaction of his mortgage and, therefore, no mortgage existed. Cherry also claims that \nrepresentatives of Chase rejected his initial attempts to make payments because of a lack of a valid loan \nnumber. Chase, however, correctly argues that payments made to an escrow account are not a proper \ntender of payment.Matthews v. Lindsay, [Citation] (1884) (requiring tender to be made to the court). Nor \ndid Cherry make the required mortgage payments to the court as provided by [relevant court rules], \nallowing for a “deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether that party claims all or \nany part of the sum or thing.” Further, Chase also correctly argues that Cherry’s failure to tender the \npayments from the escrow account or make deposits with the court is more than just a “technical breach” \nof the mortgage and note.

Prior to signing the lease, Powder Coaters negotiated the terms with Mark \nTaylor, (“Taylor”) who was the property manager for the warehouse facility and an agent of BG Holding. \n \nThe warehouse facility did not have a sufficient power supply to support Powder Coaters’ machinery. \nTherefore, Powder Coaters contracted with F & D Electrical (“F & D”) to perform electrical work which \nincluded installing two eight foot strip light fixtures and a two hundred amp load center. Powder Coaters \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1105 \nnever paid F & D for the services.

Powder Coaters is no longer a viable company. \n \nIn January 1997, F & D filed a Notice and Certificate of Mechanic’s Lien and Affidavit of Mechanic’s Lien. \nIn February 1997, F & D filed this action against BG Holding foreclosing on its mechanic’s lien pursuant to \nS.C. [statute].… \n \nA jury trial was held on September 2nd and 3rd, 1998. At the close of F & D’s evidence, and at the close of \nall evidence, BG Holding made motions for directed verdicts, which were denied. The jury returned a \nverdict for F & D in the amount of $8,264.00. The court also awarded F & D attorneys’ fees and cost in the \namount of $8,264.00, for a total award of $16,528.00. \n \nBG Holding appealed. The Court of Appeals, in a two to one decision, reversed the trial court, holding a \ndirected verdict should have been granted to BG Holding on the grounds BG Holding did not consent to \nthe electrical upgrade, as is required by the Mechanic’s Lien Statute. This Court granted F & D’s petition \nfor certiorari, and the issue before this Court is: \nDid the trial court err in denying BG Holding’s motion for directed verdict because the record \nwas devoid of any evidence of owner’s consent to materialman’s performance of work on its \nproperty as required by [the S.C. statute]? \n \nLaw/Analysis \nF & D argues the majority of the Court of Appeals erred in holding the facts of the case failed to establish \nthat BG Holding consented to the work performed by F & D, as is required by the [South Carolina] \nMechanic’s Lien Statute. We agree. \n… \n \nSouth Carolina’s Mechanic’s Lien Statute provides: \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1106 \nA person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials furnished and \nactually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building…by virtue of an agreement with, \nor by consent of, the owner of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or \nrightfully acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have a lien \nupon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or structure …to \nsecure the payment of the debt due. [emphasis added.] \n \nBoth parties in this case concede there was no express “agreement” between F & D and BG Holding. \nTherefore, the issue in this appeal turns on the meaning of the word “consent” in the statute, as applied in \nthe landlord-tenant context. This is a novel issue in South Carolina. \n \nThis Court must decide who must give the consent, who must receive consent, and what type of consent \n(general, specific, oral, written) must be given in order to satisfy the statute. Finally, the Court must \ndecide whether the evidence in this case shows BG Holding gave the requisite consent. \n \nA. Who Must Receive the Consent. \nThe Court of Appeals’ opinion in this case contemplates the consent must be between the materialman \n(lien claimant) and the landlord (owner). “It is only logical…that consent under [the relevant section] \nmust…be between the owner and the entity seeking the lien…” [Citation from Court of Appeals]. As stated \npreviously, applying the Mechanic’s Lien Statute in the landlord-tenant context presents a novel issue. We \nfind the consent required by the statute does not have to be between the landlord/owner and the \nmaterialman, as the Court of Appeals’ opinion indicates. A determination that the required consent must \ncome from the owner to the materialman means the materialman can only succeed if he can prove an \nagreement with the owner. Such an interpretation would render meaningless the language of the statute \nthat provides: “…by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of the owner.…\" \n \nTherefore, it is sufficient for the landlord/owner or his agent to give consent to his tenant. The \nlandlord/owner should be able to delegate to his tenant the responsibility for making the requested \nimprovements. The landlord/owner may not want to have direct involvement with the materialman or \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1107 \nsub-contractors, but instead may wish to allow the tenant to handle any improvements or upgrades \nhimself. In addition, the landlord/owner may be located far away and may own many properties, making \nit impractical for him to have direct involvement with the materialman.

Sheth did not ask to re-open the \nbidding.… \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1113 \nSheth filed the current lawsuit, with Alpha as the sole plaintiff, on February 14, 2003. The lawsuit asked \nfor declaratory relief, restitution, and other damages. The trial court granted the defendants’ summary \njudgment motion on August 8, 2003. Alpha appeals. \n \nLocation of the Sale \n \nAlpha argues that the sale was improper because it was at the Third Avenue entrance, not the \nAdministration Building. Alpha points to a letter from a King County employee stating that auctions are \nheld at the Administration Building. The letter also stated that personnel were instructed to direct bidders \nand trustees to that location if asked. In addition, Alpha argues that the Third Avenue entrance was not a \n‘public’ place, as required by [the statute], since auction sales were forbidden there. We disagree. Alpha \nhas not shown that the Third Avenue entrance was an improper location. The evidence shows that the \ncounty had changed its policy as to where auctions would be held and had posted signs to that effect. \nHowever, the county did not exclude people from the Third Avenue entrance or prevent auctions from \nbeing held there. Street, who frequented sales, stated that auctions were being held in both locations. The \nsale was held where the Notice of Sale indicated it would be. In addition, Alpha has not introduced any \nevidence to show that the Third Avenue entrance was not a public place at the time of the sale. The public \nwas free to come and go at that location, and the area was ‘open and available for all to use.’ Alpha relies \non Morton v. Resolution Trust (S.D. Miss. 1995) to support its contention that the venue of the sale was \nimproper. [But] Morton is not on point. \n \nDuty to Re-Open Sale \nAlpha argues that Currin should have re-opened the sale. However, it is undisputed that Sheth did not \nrequest that Currin re-open it. The evidence indicates that Currin may have known about Sheth’s interest \nin bidding prior to the day of the sale, due to a conversation with Sheth’s attorney about Sheth’s desire to \nprotect his interest in the Property. But, this knowledge did not create in Currin any affirmative duty to \noffer to re-open the sale. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1114 \nIn addition, Alpha cites no Washington authority to support the contention that Currin would have been \nobligated to re-open the sale if Sheth had asked him to. The decision to continue a sale appears to be fully \nwithin the discretion of the trustee: “[t]he trustee may for any cause the trustee deems advantageous, \ncontinue the sale.” [Citation.] Alpha’s citation to Peterson v. Kansas City Life Ins. Co., Missouri (1936) to \nsupport its contention that Currin should have re-opened the sale is unavailing. In Peterson, the Notice of \nSale indicated that the sale would be held at the ‘front’ door of the courthouse. But, the courthouse had \nfour doors, and the customary door for sales was the east door. The sheriff, acting as the trustee, \nconducted the sale at the east door, and then re-opened the sale at the south door, as there had been some \nsales at the south door. Alpha contends this shows that Currin should have re-opened the sale when \nlearning of the Administration Building location, akin to what the sheriff did in Peterson. However, \nPeterson does not indicate that the sheriff had an affirmative duty to re-sell the property at the south \ndoor. This case is not on point. \n \nChilled Bidding \nAlpha contends that Currin chilled the bidding on the Property by telling bidders that he expected a full \ncredit sale price and by holding the sale at the courthouse. Chilled bidding can be grounds for setting \naside a sale. Country Express Stores, Inc. v. Sims, [Washington Court of Appeals] (1997). TheCountry \nExpress court explained the two types of chilled bidding: \n \nThe first is intentional, occurring where there is collusion for the purpose of holding down the bids. The \nsecond consists of inadvertent and unintentional acts by the trustee that have the effect of suppressing the \nbidding. To establish chilled bidding, the challenger must establish the bidding was actually suppressed, \nwhich can sometimes be shown by an inadequate sale price. \n \nWe hold that there was no chilling. Alpha has not shown that Currin engaged in intentional chilling. There \nis no evidence that Currin knew about the signs indicating auctions were occurring at the Administration \nBuilding when he prepared the Notice of Sale, such that he intentionally held the sale at a location from \nwhich he knew bidders would be absent.

In February of 1948, Plaintiff asked to obtain a \nloan elsewhere and pay him off; he offered a discount if she would do so, three times, increasing the \namount offered each time. Plaintiff understood that Defendant was getting a loan from the Federal \nHousing Administration (FHA), but she was confronted with a number of requirements, including \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1120 \nsignificant property improvements, which—because they were neighbors—Plaintiff knew were ongoing. \nWhile the improvements were being made, in June or July, he said to her, “Just let the payments go and \nwe’ll settle everything up at the same time,” meaning she need not make monthly payments until the \nFHA was consummated, and he’d be paid from the proceeds.

The 2005 act—preceded by “massive lobbying largely by banks and credit card companies” [1]—\nwas intended by its promoters to restore personal responsibility and integrity in the bankruptcy system. \nThe law’s critics said it was simply a way for the credit card industry to extract more money from \nconsumers before their debts were wiped away. \n \nFigure 27.1 US Bankruptcies, 1980–2009 \n \nBankruptcy Action.com,http://www.bankruptcyaction.com/USbankstats.htm, statistics from \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. \n \nBankruptcy Courts, Judges, and Costs \nEach federal judicial district has a US Bankruptcy Court, whose judges are appointed by US Courts of \nAppeal. Unless both sides agree otherwise, bankruptcy judges are to hear only bankruptcy matters (called \ncore proceedings). Bankruptcy trustees are government lawyers appointed by the US Attorney General. \nThey have administrative responsibilities in overseeing the proceedings. \n \nThe filing fee for a bankruptcy is about $200, depending upon the type of bankruptcy, and the typical \nlawyer’s fee for uncomplicated cases is about $1,200–$1,400. \n \nOverview of Bankruptcy Provisions \nThe BAPCPA provides for six different kinds of bankruptcy proceedings. Each is covered by its own \nchapter in the act and is usually referred to by its chapter number (see Figure 27.2 \"Bankruptcy Options\"). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1125 \n \nFigure 27.2 Bankruptcy Options \n \nThe bankruptcy statute (as opposed to case law interpreting it) is usually referred to as the \nbankruptcy code. The types of bankruptcies are as follows: \n \n• \nChapter 7, Liquidation: applies to all debtors except railroads, insurance companies, most banks \nand credit unions, and homestead associations. [2]A liquidation is a “straight” bankruptcy \nproceeding. It entails selling the debtor’s nonexempt assets for cash and distributing the cash to \nthe creditors, thereby discharging the insolvent person or business from any further liability for \nthe debt. About 70 percent of all bankruptcy filings are Chapter 7. \n• \nChapter 9, Adjustment of debts of a municipality: applies to municipalities that are insolvent and \nwant to adjust their debts. [3] (The law does not suppose that a town, city, or county will go out of \nexistence in the wake of insolvency.) \n• \nChapter 11, Reorganization: applies to anybody who could file Chapter 7, plus railroads. It is the \nmeans by which a financially troubled company can continue to operate while its financial affairs \nare put on a sounder basis. A business might liquidate following reorganization but will probably \ntake on new life after negotiations with creditors on how the old debt is to be paid off. A company \nmay voluntarily decide to seek Chapter 11 protection in court, or it may be forced involuntarily \ninto a Chapter 11 proceeding. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1126 \n• \nChapter 12, Adjustment of debts of a family farmer or fisherman with regular annual \nincome. [4] Many family farmers cannot qualify for reorganization under Chapter 13 because of the \nlow debt ceiling, and under Chapter 11, the proceeding is often complicated and expensive. As a \nresult, Congress created Chapter 12, which applies only to farmers whose total debts do not \nexceed $1.5 million. \n• \nChapter 13, Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income: applies only to individuals \n(no corporations or partnerships) with debt not exceeding about $1.3 million. [5] This chapter \npermits an individual with regular income to establish a repayment plan, usually either a \ncomposition (an agreement among creditors, discussed in Section 27.5 \"Alternatives to \nBankruptcy\", “Alternatives to Bankruptcy”) or an extension (a stretch-out of the time for paying \nthe entire debt). \n• \nChapter 15, Ancillary and other cross-border cases: incorporates the United Nations’ Model Law \non Cross-Border Insolvency to promote cooperation among nations involved in cross-border \ncases and is intended to create legal certainty for trade and investment. “Ancillary” refers to the \npossibility that a US debtor might have assets or obligations in a foreign country; those non-US \naspects of the case are “ancillary” to the US bankruptcy case. \n \nThe BAPCPA includes three chapters that set forth the procedures to be applied to the various \nproceedings. Chapter 1, “General Provisions,” establishes who is eligible for relief under the act. Chapter \n3, “Case Administration,” spells out the powers of the various officials involved in the bankruptcy \nproceedings and establishes the methods for instituting bankruptcy cases.

However, some principles \nvary, and we conclude the chapter by noting special features of two other important proceedings—Chapter \n13 and Chapter 11. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBankruptcy law’s purpose is to give the honest debtor a fresh start and to resolve disputes among creditors. \nThe most recent amendments to the law were effective in 2005. Bankruptcy law provides relief to six kinds of \ndebtors: (1) Chapter 7, straight bankruptcy—liquidation—applies to most debtors (except banks and \nrailroads); (2) Chapter 9 applies to municipalities; (3) Chapter 11 is business reorganization; (4) Chapter 12 \napplies to farmers; (5) Chapter 13 is for wage earners; and (6) Chapter 15 applies to cross-border \nbankruptcies.

Understand the basic procedures involved in administering a bankruptcy case. \n2. Recognize the basic elements of creditors’ rights under the bankruptcy code. \n3. Understand the fundamentals of what property is included in the debtor’s estate. \n4. Identify some of the debtor’s exemptions—what property can be kept by the debtor. \n5. Know some of the debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. \n6. Know how an estate is liquidated under Chapter 7. \n \n \nCase Administration (Chapter 3 of the Bankruptcy Code) \nRecall that the purpose of liquidation is to convert the debtor’s assets—except those exempt under the \nlaw—into cash for distribution to the creditors and thereafter to discharge the debtor from further \nliability. With certain exceptions, any person may voluntarily file a petition to liquidate under Chapter 7. A \n“person” is defined as any individual, partnership, or corporation. The exceptions are railroads and \ninsurance companies, banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and the like. \n \nFor a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding, as for bankruptcy proceedings in general, the various aspects of \ncase administration are covered by the bankruptcy code’s Chapter 3. These include the rules governing \ncommencement of the proceedings, the effect of the petition in bankruptcy, the first meeting of the \ncreditors, and the duties and powers of trustees. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1129 \nCommencement \nThe bankruptcy begins with the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with the bankruptcy court. \n \nVoluntary and Involuntary Petitions \nThe individual, partnership, or corporation may file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy; 99 percent of \nbankruptcies are voluntary petitions filed by the debtor. But involuntary bankruptcy is possible, too, \nunder Chapter 7 or Chapter 11.

We begin with the rules \ngoverning proof of claims by creditors and the priority of their claims. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1131 \n \nClaims and Creditors \nA claim is defined as a right to payment, whether or not it is reduced to judgment, liquidated, \nunliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or \nunsecured. A creditor is defined as a person or entity with a claim that arose no later than when the court \nissues the order for relief. These are very broad definitions, intended to give the debtor the broadest \npossible relief when finally discharged. \n \nProof of Claims \nBefore the trustee can distribute proceeds of the estate, unsecured creditors must file a proof of claim, \nprima facie evidence that they are owed some amount of money. They must do so within six months after \nthe first date set for the first meeting of creditors. A creditor’s claim is disallowed, even though it is valid, \nif it is not filed in a timely manner. A party in interest, such as the trustee or creditor, may object to a \nproof of claim, in which case the court must determine whether to allow it. In the absence of objection, the \nclaim is “deemed allowed.” The court will not allow some claims. These include unenforceable claims, \nclaims for unmatured interest, claims that may be offset by debts the creditor owes the debtor, and \nunreasonable charges by an insider or an attorney. If it’s a “no asset” bankruptcy—most are—creditors are \nin effect told by the court not to waste their time filing proof of claim. \n \nClaims with Priority \nThe bankruptcy act sets out categories of claimants and establishes priorities among them. The law is \ncomplex because it sets up different orders of priorities. \n \nFirst, secured creditors get their security interests before anyone else is satisfied, because the security \ninterest is not part of the property that the trustee is entitled to bring into the estate. This is why being a \nsecured creditor is important (as discussed in Chapter 25 \"Secured Transactions and \nSuretyship\"and Chapter 26 \"Mortgages and Nonconsensual Liens\"). To the extent that secured creditors \nhave claims in excess of their collateral, they are considered unsecured or general creditors and are \nlumped in with general creditors of the appropriate class. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1132 \n \nSecond, of the six classes of claimants (see Figure 27.3 \"Distribution of the Estate\"), the first is known as \nthat of “priority claims.” It is subdivided into ten categories ranked in order of priority. The highest-\npriority class within the general class of priority claims must be paid off in full before the next class can \nshare in a distribution from the estate, and so on. Within each class, members will share pro rata if there \nare not enough assets to satisfy everyone fully. The priority classes, from highest to lowest, are set out in \nthe bankruptcy code (11 USC Section 507) as follows: \n \n(1) Domestic support obligations (“DSO”), which are claims for support due to the spouse, former \nspouse, child, or child’s representative, and at a lower priority within this class are any claims by \na governmental unit that has rendered support assistance to the debtor’s family obligations. \n \n(2) Administrative expenses that are required to administer the bankruptcy case itself. Under \nformer law, administrative expenses had the highest priority, but Congress elevated domestic \nsupport obligations above administrative expenses with the passage of the BAPCPA. Actually, \nthough, administrative expenses have a de facto priority over domestic support obligations, \nbecause such expenses are deducted before they are paid to DSO recipients. Since trustees are \npaid from the bankruptcy estate, the courts have allowed de facto top priority for administrative \nexpenses because no trustee is going to administer a bankruptcy case for nothing (and no lawyer \nwill work for long without getting paid, either). \n \n(3) Gap creditors. Claims made by gap creditors in an involuntary bankruptcy petition under \nChapter 7 or Chapter 11 are those that arise between the filing of an involuntary bankruptcy \npetition and the order for relief issued by the court. These claims are given priority because \notherwise creditors would not deal with the debtor, usually a business, when the business has \ndeclared bankruptcy but no trustee has been appointed and no order of relief issued. \n \n(4) Employee wages up to $10,950 for each worker, for the 180 days previous to either the \nbankruptcy filing or when the business ceased operations, whichever is earlier (180-day period). \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1133",

Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 11 bankruptcies. \n2. Understand the basic concepts of Chapter 13 bankruptcies. \n \n \nReorganization: Chapter 11 Bankruptcy \nOverview \nChapter 11 provides a means by which corporations, partnerships, and other businesses, including sole \nproprietorships, can rehabilitate themselves and continue to operate free from the burden of debts that \nthey cannot pay. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1149 \n \nIt is simple enough to apply for the protection of the court in Chapter 11 proceeding, and for many years, \nlarge financially ailing companies have sought shelter in Chapter 11. Well-known examples include \nGeneral Motors, Texaco, K-Mart, Delta Airlines, and Northwest Airlines. An increasing number of \ncorporations have turned to Chapter 11 even though, by conventional terms, they were solvent. Doing so \nenables them to negotiate with creditors to reduce debt. It also may even permit courts to snuff out \nlawsuits that have not yet been filed. Chapters 3 and 5, discussed in Section 27.2 \"Case Administration; \nCreditors’ Claims; Debtors’ Exemptions and Dischargeable Debts; Debtor’s Estate\", apply to Chapter 11 \nproceedings also. Our discussion, therefore, is limited to special features of Chapter 11. \n \nHow It Works \nEligibility \nAny person eligible for discharge in Chapter 7 proceeding (plus railroads) is eligible for a Chapter 11 \nproceeding, except stockbrokers and commodity brokers. Individuals filing Chapter 11 must take credit \ncounseling; businesses do not. A company may voluntarily enter Chapter 11 or may be put there \ninvoluntarily by creditors. Individuals can file Chapter 11 particularly if they have too much debt to qualify \nfor Chapter 13 and make too much money to qualify for Chapter 7; under the 2005 act, individuals must \ncommit future wages to creditors, just as in Chapter 13. [1] \n \nOperation of Business \nUnless a trustee is appointed, the debtor will retain possession of the business and may continue to \noperate with its own management. The court may appoint a trustee on request of any party in interest \nafter notice and a hearing. The appointment may be made for cause—such as dishonesty, incompetence, \nor gross mismanagement—or if it is otherwise in the best interests of the creditors. Frequently, the same \nincompetent management that got the business into bankruptcy is left running it—that’s a criticism of \nChapter 11. \n \nCreditors’ Committee \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1150 \nThe court must appoint a committee of unsecured creditors as soon as practicable after issuing the order \nfor relief. The committee must consist of creditors willing to serve who have the seven largest claims, \nunless the court decides to continue a committee formed before the filing, if the committee was fairly \nchosen and adequately represents the various claims. The committee has several duties, including these: \n(1) to investigate the debtor’s financial affairs, (2) to determine whether to seek appointment of a trustee \nor to let the business continue to operate, and (3) to consult with the debtor or trustee throughout the \ncase. \n \nThe Reorganization Plan \nThe debtor may always file its own plan, whether in a voluntary or involuntary case. If the court leaves the \ndebtor in possession without appointing a trustee, the debtor has the exclusive right to file a \nreorganization plan during the first 120 days. If it does file, it will then have another 60 days to obtain the \ncreditors’ acceptances. Although its exclusivity expires at the end of 180 days, the court may lengthen or \nshorten the period for good cause. At the end of the exclusive period, the creditors’ committee, a single \ncreditor, or a holder of equity in the debtor’s property may file a plan. If the court does appoint a trustee, \nany party in interest may file a plan at any time. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act specifies certain features of the plan and permits others to be included. \nAmong other things, the plan must (1) designate classes of claims and ownership interests; (2) specify \nwhich classes or interests are impaired—a claim or ownership interest is impaired if the creditor’s legal, \nequitable, contractual rights are altered under the plan; (3) specify the treatment of any class of claims or \ninterests that is impaired under the plan; (4) provide the same treatment of each claim or interests of a",

The essential difference between assignment and composition lies in the \ncreditors’ agreement: an assignment implies no agreement among the creditors, whereas a composition \ndoes. Not all creditors of the particular debtor need agree to the composition for it to be valid.

The \nreceiver may liquidate the property, continue to operate the business, or preserve the assets without \noperating the business until the court finally determines how to dispose of the debtor’s property. \n \nThe difficulty with most of the alternatives to bankruptcy lies in their voluntary character: a creditor who \nrefuses to go along with an agreement to discharge the debtor can usually manage to thwart the debtor \nand her fellow creditors because, at the end of the day, the US Constitution forbids the states from \nimpairing private citizens’ contractual obligations. The only final protection, therefore, is to be found in \nthe federal bankruptcy law. \n \nKEY TAKEAWAY \n \nBankruptcy is expensive and frequently convoluted. Nonbankruptcy alternatives include assignment for the \nbenefit of creditors (the debtor’s assets are assigned to a trustee who manages or disposes of them for \ncreditors), compositions (agreements by creditors to accept less than they are owed and to discharge the \ndebtor from further liability), and receivership (a type of court-supervised assignment). \n \nEXERCISES \n \n1.

The loans have been assigned to Educational \nCredit Management Corporation (“ECMC”). By September 2009, the accrual of interest on these student \nloans had caused the debt to balloon to more than $146,000. The debtor asks the court to declare that \nthese student loans were discharged in bankruptcy. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code provides financially distressed debtors with a fresh start by discharging most of \ntheir pre-petition debts.…However, under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8), there is a presumption that educational \nloans extended by or with the aid of a governmental unit or nonprofit institution are nondischargeable \nunless the debtor can demonstrate that their repayment would be an undue hardship. See [Citation]. This \nexception to a bankruptcy discharge ensures that student loans, which are typically extended solely on the \nbasis of the student’s future earnings potential, cannot be discharged by recent graduates who then pocket \nall of the future benefits derived from their education. See [Citation]. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1159 \nThe debtor bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she is entitled to a \ndischarge of the student loan. See [Citation]. That is, the debtor must prove that repayment of student \nloans will cause an undue hardship. \n \nThe Bankruptcy Code does not define “the undue hardship.” Courts interpreting section 523(a)(8), \nhowever, have concluded that undue hardship [and] is something more than “garden-variety hardship.” \n[Citation.] Only cases involving “real and substantial” hardship merit discharges. See [Citation.] \n \nThe Ninth Circuit has adopted a three-part test to guide courts in their attempts to determine whether a \ndebtor will suffer an undue hardship is required to repay a student loan: \n \n• \nFirst, the debtor must establish “that she cannot maintain, based on current income and \nexpenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the \nloans.”… \n• \nSecond, the debtor must show “that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of",

N.Y. State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., [Citation]). \n \nDebtor must satisfy all three parts of the Brunner test before her student loans can be discharged. Failure \nto prove any of the three prongs will defeat a debtor’s case. \n \nWhen this bankruptcy case was filed in September 2005, the debtor was a single woman and had no \ndependents. She is 39 years old. \n \nSchedule I reported that the debtor was unemployed. The debtor’s responses to the Statement of Financial \nAffairs revealed that she had received $5,500 in income during 2005 prior to the filing of the petition. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1160 \nEvidence at trial indicated that after the petition was filed, the debtor found work and earned a total of \n$9,424 in 2005. In 2004 and 2003, she earned $13,994 and $17,339, respectively. \nDespite this modest income, the debtor did not immediately file an adversary proceeding to determine the \ndischargeability of her student loans. It was almost three years after the entry of her chapter 7 discharge \n‘on January 3, 2006 that the debtor reopened her chapter 7 case in order to pursue this adversary \nproceeding.’ \n \nIn her complaint, the debtor admits that after she received a discharge, she found part-time work with a \nchurch and later took a full-time job as a speech therapist. During 2006, the debtor earned $20,009 and \nin 2007 she earned $37,314. Hence, while it is clear the debtor’s income was very modest in the time \nperiod immediately prior to her bankruptcy petition, her financial situation improved during her \nbankruptcy case. \n \nThe court cannot conclude based on the evidence of the debtor’s financial circumstances up to the date of \nthe discharge, that she was unable to maintain a minimal standard of living if she was required to repay \nher students [sic] loans. \n \nHowever, in January 2007, the debtor was injured in an automobile accident. Her injuries eventually \nhalted the financial progress she had been making and eventually prevented her from working. She now \nsubsists on social security disability payments. \n \nThe circumstance creating the debtor’s hardship, the automobile accident, occurred after her chapter 7 \npetition was filed, indeed, approximately one year after her discharge was entered. The debtor is \nmaintaining that this post-petition, post-discharge circumstance warrants a declaration that her student \nloans were discharged effective from the petition date. \n \nWhen must the circumstances creating a debtor’s hardship arise: before the bankruptcy case is filed; after \nthe case if filed but prior to the entry of a discharge; or at anytime, including after the entry of a \ndischarge? \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1161 \n \nThe court concludes that the circumstances causing a chapter 7 debtor’s financial hardship must arise \nprior to the entry of the discharge. If the circumstances causing a debtor’s hardship arise after the entry of \na discharge, those circumstances cannot form the basis of a determination that repayment of a student \nloan will be an undue hardship.… \n \n[T]here is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code requiring that a complaint under section 523(a)(8) [to \ndischarge student loans] be filed at any particular point in a bankruptcy case, whether it is filed under \nchapter 7 or 13. [Relevant Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure] permits such dischargeability \ncomplaints to be brought at any time, including after the entry of a discharge and the closing of the \nbankruptcy case.… \n \nWhile a debtor’s decision to file an action to determine the dischargeability of a student loan is not \ntemporally constrained, this does not mean that a debtor’s financial hardship may arise after a discharge \nhas been entered. \n \n[The] Coleman [case, cited by debtor] deals with the ripeness of a dispute concerning the dischargeability \nof a student loan. [The Ninth Circuit held that it] is ripe for adjudication at any point during the case. The \nNinth Circuit did not conclude, however, that a debtor could rely upon post-discharge circumstances to \nestablish undue hardship.

N.Y. 1984) \n \nLifland, Bankruptcy Judge. \n \nWhether an industrial enterprise in the United States is highly successful is often gauged by its \n“membership” in what has come to be known as the “Fortune 500”. Having attained this measure of \nfinancial achievement, Johns-Manville Corp. and its affiliated companies (collectively referred to as \n“Manville”) were deemed a paradigm of success in corporate America by the financial community. Thus, \nManville’s filing for protection under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (“the Code or the \nBankruptcy Code”) on August 26, 1982 (“the filing date”) was greeted with great surprise and \nconsternation on the part of some of its creditors and other corporations that were being sued along with \nManville for injuries caused by asbestos exposure. As discussed at length herein, Manville submits that \nthe sole factor necessitating its filing is the mammoth problem of uncontrolled proliferation of asbestos \nhealth suits brought against it because of its substantial use for many years of products containing \nasbestos which injured those who came into contact with the dust of this lethal substance. According to \nManville, this current problem of approximately 16,000 lawsuits pending as of the filing date is \ncompounded by the crushing economic burden to be suffered by Manville over the next 20–30 years by \nthe filing of an even more staggering number of suits by those who had been exposed but who will not \nmanifest the asbestos-related diseases until some time during this future period (“the future asbestos \nclaimants”). Indeed, approximately 6,000 asbestos health claims are estimated to have arisen in only the \nfirst 16 months since the filing date. This burden is further compounded by the insurance industry’s \ngeneral disavowal of liability to Manville on policies written for this very purpose. \n \nIt is the propriety of the filing by Manville which is the subject of the instant decision. Four separate \nmotions to dismiss the petition pursuant to Section 1112(b) of the Code have been lodged before this \nCourt.… \nPreliminarily, it must be stated that there is no question that Manville is eligible to be a debtor under the \nCode’s statutory requirements. Moreover, it should also be noted that neither Section 109 nor any other \nprovision relating to voluntary petitions by companies contains any insolvency \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1165 \nrequirement.…Accordingly, it is abundantly clear that Manville has met all of the threshold eligibility \nrequirements for filing a voluntary petition under the Code.… \n \nA “principal goal” of the Bankruptcy Code is to provide “open access” to the “bankruptcy process.” \n[Citation.] The rationale behind this “open access” policy is to provide access to bankruptcy relief which is \nas “open” as “access to the credit economy.” Thus, Congress intended that “there should be no legal \nbarrier to voluntary petitions.” Another major goal of the Code, that of “rehabilitation of debtors,” \nrequires that relief for debtors must be “timely.” Congress declared that it is essential to both the “open \naccess” and “rehabilitation” goals that \n \n[i]nitiating relief should not be a death knell. The process should encourage resort to it, by \ndebtors and creditors, that cuts short the dissipation of assets and the accumulation of debts. \nBelated commencement of a case may kill an opportunity for reorganization or arrangement. \n \nAccordingly, the drafters of the Code envisioned that a financially beleaguered debtor with real debt and \nreal creditors should not be required to wait until the economic situation is beyond repair in order to file a \nreorganization petition. The “Congressional purpose” in enacting the Code was to encourage resort to the \nbankruptcy process. This philosophy not only comports with the elimination of an insolvency \nrequirement, but also is a corollary of the key aim of Chapter 11 of the Code, that of avoidance of \nliquidation. The drafters of the Code announced this goal, declaring that reorganization is more efficient",

BAP, (Idaho, 2008) \n \nOn July 13, 1995, Ryan was convicted of possession of an unregistered firearm under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) \nin the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. Ryan was sentenced to fifty-seven months in \nprison followed by three years of supervised release. In addition, Ryan was ordered to pay a fine of \n$7,500…, costs of prosecution in the amount of $83,420, and a special assessment of $50.00. Ryan served \nhis sentence. He also paid the $7,500 fine. The district court, following an appellate mandate, ultimately \neliminated the restitution obligation. \n \nOn April 25, 2003, Ryan filed a petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter 7 in the District of Idaho. He \nreceived his chapter 7 discharge on August 11, 2003. Shortly thereafter, Ryan filed a case under chapter \n13, listing as his only obligation the amount of unpaid costs of prosecution owed to the United States \n(“Government”).… \n \nRyan completed payments under the plan, and an “Order of Discharge” was entered on October 5, 2006. \nThe chapter 13 trustee’s final report reflected that the Government received $2,774.89 from payments \nmade by Ryan under his plan, but a balance of $77,088.34 on the Government’s costs of prosecution \nclaim remained unpaid. Ryan then renewed his request for determination of dischargeability. The \nbankruptcy court held that the unpaid portion of the Government’s claim for costs of prosecution was \nexcepted from discharge by § 1328(a)(3). Ryan appealed. \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1168 \n \nSection 1328(a)(3) provides an exception to discharge in chapter 13 for “restitution, or a criminal fine.” It \nstates, in pertinent part: \n \n[A]s soon as practicable after the completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, the \ncourt shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under \nsection 502 of this title except any debt… \n \n(3) for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime \n[.] [emphasis added]. \n \nThe essential question, then, is whether these costs of prosecution constitute a “criminal fine.” \n \nStatutory interpretation begins with a review of the particular language used by Congress in the relevant \nversion of the law. [Citation.] \n \nThe term “criminal fine” is not defined in [Chapter 13] or anywhere else in the Bankruptcy Code. \nHowever, its use in § 1328(a)(3) implicates two important policies embedded in the Bankruptcy Code. \nFirst, in light of the objective to provide a fresh start for debtors overburdened by debts that they cannot \npay, exceptions to discharge are interpreted strictly against objecting creditors and in favor of \ndebtors. See, e.g. [Citations]. In chapter 13, this principle is particularly important because Congress \nadopted the liberal “superdischarge” provisions of § 1328 as an incentive to debtors to commit to a plan to \npay their creditors all of their disposable income over a period of years rather than simply discharging \ntheir debts in a chapter 7 liquidation. \n \n“[T]he dischargeability of debts in chapter 13 that are not dischargeable in chapter 7 represents a policy \njudgment that [it] is preferable for debtors to attempt to pay such debts to the best of their abilities over \nthree years rather than for those debtors to have those debts hanging over their heads indefinitely, \nperhaps for the rest of their lives.” [Citations.] \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n1169 \n \nA second, countervailing policy consideration is a historic deference, both in the Bankruptcy Code and in \nthe administration of prior bankruptcy law, to excepting criminal sanctions from discharge in bankruptcy. \nApplication of this policy is consistent with a general recognition that, “[t]he principal purpose of the \nBankruptcy Code is to grant a ‘fresh start’ to the ‘honest but unfortunate debtor.’” [Citation] (emphasis \nadded [in original]). \n \nThe legislative history is clear that [in its 1994 amendments to the bankruptcy law] Congress intended to \noverrule the result in [of a 1990 Supreme Court case so that]:…“[N]o debtor with criminal restitution \nobligations will be able to discharge them through any bankruptcy proceeding.”… \n \nThe imposition on a defendant of the costs of a special prosecutor is different from ordering a defendant \nto pay criminal fines. Costs are paid to the entity incurring the costs; criminal fines are generally paid to a \nspecial fund for victims’ compensation and assistance in the U.S. Treasury.… \n \nTo honor the principle that exceptions to discharge are to be construed narrowly in favor of debtors, \nparticularly in chapter 13, where a broad discharge was provided by Congress as an incentive for debtors \nto opt for relief under that chapter rather than under chapter 7, it is not appropriate to expand the scope \nof the [Chapter 13] exception beyond the terms of the statute. Congress could have adopted an exception",

Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the\nauthors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people\nand businesses.\nThroughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the\nimportance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types include FRED\n(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed)® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices.\nPractical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas\nInstruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets\nare included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for\nstudent reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the\nchapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7, 8, 9) and statistics (Chapters 14, 15, 16) problems. The\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making. Chapters 13 and 14\n(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about the R software\n(https://openstax.org/r/r-software) package to promote further interest in trends in data science.\nTeaching Plan Options\nPrinciples of Finance includes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts\nfrom prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters\non prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-\nsemester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend\nfocusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:\n1 Introduction to Finance\nCore\n2 Corporate Structure and Governance\nCore\n3 Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nExtension\n4 Accrual Accounting Process\nExtension\nTable 1\n2\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n5 Financial Statements\nCore\n6 Measures of Financial Health\nCore\n7 Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nCore\n8 Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nCore\n9 Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nCore\n10 Bonds and Bond Valuation\nCore\n11 Stocks and Stock Valuation\nCore\n12 Historical Performance of US Markets\nCore\n13 Statistical Analysis in Finance\nExtension\n14 Regression Analysis in Finance\nExtension\n15 How to Think about Investing\nCore\n16 How Companies Think about Investing\nCore\n17 How Firms Raise Capital\nCore\n18 Financial Forecasting\nCore\n19 The Importance of Trade Credit and Working Capital in Planning Extension\n20 Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nExtension\nTable 1\nAlthough chapters are written to be independent, they do generally build on the understanding in the\nprevious core chapters.

Without good financial protocol,\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality",

Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\nwhere’s the risk?\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4). Return could be\n12\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe interest earned on an investment in a bond or the dividend from the purchase of stock. Return could be\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\n•\nDefault risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\n•\nInflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\n•\nDiversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\n•\nNon-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\nunnecessary diversifiable risk. We measure non-diversifiable risk with a statistical term called beta.\nSubsequent chapters on risk and return provide a more in-depth discussion of beta.\n•\nPolitical risk is associated with macroeconomic issues beyond the control of a company or its managers.\nThis is the risk of local, state, or national governments “changing the rules” and disrupting firm cash\nflows. Political risk could come about due to zoning changes, product liability decisions, taxation, or even\nnationalization of a firm or industry.\n1.1 • What Is Finance?\n13\n1.2\nThe Role of Finance in an Organization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the finance function.\n•\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job\nresponsibilities.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\nstrategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n•\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\n14\n1 • Introduction to Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the\ntiming and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\n•\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most\nimportant aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\n•\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic\nconditions are essential elements of financial planning.\n•\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are\nimportant aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been,\nhow it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\nFigure 1.5 The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help\nto evaluate a firm.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nElements of a Financial Plan",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization\n15\ndetermine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The\nprocess should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a\nperiodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences\nbetween the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n1.3\nImportance of Data and Technology\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the role of data in finance.\n•\nList and describe the various types of corporate data available.\n•\nExplain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\n•\nDescribe the impact of data digitization.\n•\nExplain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\nImportance of Data\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should",

For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\nmarket transactions.\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\nKey Market Players\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\n6\nIbid.\n1.5 • Markets and Participants\n21\nFigure 1.7 Broker and Dealer Markets\nDealers\nFinancial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\ndescriptions or worse.

They need both the macro data, so\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement.

            "chunk": "If managers are to help stockholders maximize their wealth, they must know how that wealth is determined in\nthe first place. One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\n2.1\nBusiness Structures\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify the business form created by most organizations.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\n•\nContrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\n•\nList and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal\nstructure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a\nsignificant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the\nfollowing:\n1.\nSole proprietorships\n2.\nPartnerships\n3.\nCorporations\n4.\nHybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)\nThe vast majority of businesses take the form of a proprietorship. However, based on the total dollar value of\ncombined sales, more than 80 percent of all business in the United States is conducted by a corporation.1\nBecause corporations engage in the most business, and because most successful businesses eventually\nconvert into corporations, we will focus on corporations in this chapter. However, it is still important to\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\nSole Proprietorships\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\n1.\nThey have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\n1\nAaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings. The Brookings Institution, May 15, 2017.\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/9-facts-about-pass-through-businesses\n40\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n2.\nThey are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations.\n3.\nTaxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\n4.\nControlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\nshortcomings:\n1.\nA sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it.

If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\ncoverage the business might have).\n2.\nUnlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\n3.\nBecause of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\nbusinesses.\n4.\nA sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\noutweigh the advantages.\nPartnerships\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\nraise large amounts of capital.\n2.1 • Business Structures\n41\nCorporations\nThe most common type of organizational structure for larger businesses is the corporation. A corporation is a\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\ncompany.\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\nsize and complexity.\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area.

For example, if a sole proprietor initially invested $5,000 to start their business and a customer sues them for $500,000 and the company loses the lawsuit, the sole proprietor would be liable for the remaining $495,000."

                    "answer": "A partnership has a tax advantage over a sole proprietorship because the firm's income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the partners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income tax. This means that each partner only pays taxes on their share of the partnership's income, rather than the entire income being taxed at the sole proprietor's personal income tax rate."

The earnings of most corporations in the United\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\nbusinesses.\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\n42\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLimited Liability Corporation\nLimited Liability Partnership\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nFewer restrictions on eligibility (only one\nmember allowed; can be professional,\nalthough some states disallow professionals)\nOnly certain\nprofessions\neligible\nUsually more personal liability protection\nLimited\nprotection from\npartners’ actions\nPersonal protection as well\nas protection from\nnegligence of other\npartners\nFlexibility in taxation\nEarnings\nincluded in\nmembers’\npersonal taxes\nEarnings taxed just once\nMust file taxes\nas pass-\nthrough entity\nTable 2.1 Advantages and Disadvantages of LLCs and LLPs\nLLCs and LLPs have gained great popularity in recent years, but larger companies still find substantial\nadvantages in being structured as C corporations. This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations.

The primary roles of any management group involve\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is\n2.2 • Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management\n45\noften not in the best interest of the long-term health and objectives of companies or their shareholders.\n2.3\nRole of the Board of Directors\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the oversight functions performed by boards.\n•\nDefine an independent board member.\n•\nCompare arguments for and against having independent board members.\n•\nDescribe ways boards can become diverse.\nFunctions of a Board of Directors\nA board of directors is a group of people who are elected to represent shareholders, and these directors are\nthen ultimately responsible for running the company. Every public company is legally required to install a\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\n46\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInternational Structure of a Board of Directors\nThe structure of a board of directors varies more outside of the United States. In Asia and the European Union,\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\nthe prominent executive officer.\nOversight: Corporate Governance\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\ncompetition and ethical behavior.",

Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\nagendas of most boards.\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\n48\n2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPepsiCo\nPepsiCo is a global leader in the food and beverage industry.

Why do you\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\nCompanies list for 2021?\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\ncompanies.\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\n•\nhelps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\nshareholders;\n•\nallows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\n•\nenables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\nself-profiting motives.\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\nUnited States.

Table 3.3 is a fictional example of a supply schedule for pizzas. In some cases, higher\nprices encourage producers to provide more of their product for sale.

Because a higher price\nencourages suppliers to sell more pizzas, the supply curve will be upward sloping.\nFigure 3.4 Supply Curve for Pizzas\nThe supply curve isolates the relationship between the price of pizzas and the quantity of pizzas supplied. All\nother relevant economic factors are assumed to remain unchanged when the curve is drawn. If a factor such\nas the cost of cheese or the salaries paid to workers changes, then the supply curve will move. A shift to the\nright indicates that a greater quantity of pizzas will be provided by firms at a particular price; this would\nindicate an increase in supply. A decrease in supply would be represented by a shift in the supply curve to the\nleft.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSupply Curve Shifts\nThe ceteris paribus assumption is made when drawing a supply curve, just as it is when drawing a demand\ncurve. If a relevant economic variable other than the price of the good for which the supply curve is drawn\nchanges, the supply curve will shift. For more information about how changes in these variables will move\nthe supply curve, watch the MRU video on supply curve shifts (https://openstax.org/r/mru-video-on-\nsupply).\nEquilibrium Price\nDemand represents buyers, and supply represents sellers. In the market, these two groups interact to\ndetermine the price of a good and the quantity of the good that is sold. Because both the demand curve and\nthe supply curve are graphed with price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, these two\ncurves can be placed in the same graph, as is shown in Figure 3.5.\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n71\nFigure 3.5 Graph of Demand and Supply Showing Equilibrium Price and Quantity\nThe point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is known as the equilibrium. At the equilibrium\nprice, the quantity demanded will equal exactly the quantity supplied. There is no shortage or surplus of the\nproduct. In the example shown in Figure 3.5, when the price is $15, consumers want to purchase 30 pizzas and\nsellers want to make 30 pizzas available for purchase. The market is in balance.\nA price higher than the equilibrium price will not be sustainable in a competitive marketplace. If the price of a\npizza were $20, suppliers would make 40 pizzas available, but the quantity of pizzas demanded would be only\n20 pizzas. This would be a surplus, or excess quantity supplied, of pizzas. Restaurant owners who see that they\nhave 40 pizzas to sell but can only sell 20 of those pizzas will lower their prices to encourage more customers\nto purchase pizzas. At the same time, the restaurant owners will cut back on their pizza production. This\nprocess will drive the pizza price down from $20 toward the equilibrium price.\nThe opposite would occur if the price of a pizza were only $5. Customers may want to purchase 50 pizzas, but\nrestaurants would only want to sell 10 pizzas at the low price. Quantity demanded would exceed quantity\nsupplied. At a price below the equilibrium price, a shortage would occur. Shortages drive prices up toward the\nequilibrium price.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Equilibrium Price\nA competitive market will drive prices to equilibrium.

Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n73\nSupply2, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium1\nto Equilibrium2\n. The new equilibrium price will\nbe $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left. In Figure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change\nfrom\nto\n.\nFigure 3.8 A Decrease in Demand\nAt the new equilibrium,\n, the price of a pizza is $10.

Show this movement in a graph. What happens to\nthe equilibrium? What are some reasons you can think of that may have caused this change in demand?\nSolution:\nThis is an increase in demand. At every price, consumers now want to purchase more sweatshirts than they\ndid before. This is shown in the graph as a movement of the demand curve outward to the right. Both the\nequilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will rise because of this increase in demand. The equilibrium\nprice will now be $40, and the equilibrium quantity of sweatshirts will be 30. Note that there is not an\nincrease in supply; the supply curve does not move. There is simply an increase in quantity supplied (see\nFigure 3.9).\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n75\nFigure 3.9 Graph Showing Increase in Sweatshirt Supply\nA change in any of the factors that are assumed to be held constant under the ceteris paribus assumption\ncould have caused the demand curve to shift to the right.

The investment\nspending category is roughly 15% to 18% of the US GDP.\nGovernment spending includes spending by federal, state, and local governments. Federal spending would\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\nHistorical Trends in GDP\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\nyears.\n5\n“GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\n3.2 • Macroeconomics\n81\nFigure 3.12 Growth of the US GDP6 Gross domestic product (GDP), the featured measure of US output, is the market value of the\ngoods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States.

A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that\ninterest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.\nThere is no shortage of loanable funds, nor is there any surplus.\n10\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. “US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.” Last updated July 19, 2021.\nhttps://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions\n86\n3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNominal Interest Rates\nThe nominal interest rate is the stated, or quoted, interest rate. If you want to borrow money to purchase a\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\nReal Interest Rates\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\nhave $1,060 to spend.\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\nRisk Premiums\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.",

You will notice,\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\ngiven time.\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\nare occurring are extremely low.\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\n3.4 • Interest Rates\n87\ncredit risk. Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who\nare higher risk.\nCompanies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US\ngovernment. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks.

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents.

These rates are influenced by factors such as credit risk, the borrower's financial stability, and the type of loan. For example, the US government pays a lower interest rate than corporations or individuals due to its lower credit risk. The prime rate is the interest rate that banks charge their best customers, large companies that are financially strong and have a very low risk of default. Credit card loans, on the other hand, have notoriously high interest rates due to the high risk involved for the lender."

You can enter the amount of one\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\nCurrency Appreciation\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates\n89\nCurrency prices are determined in the marketplace through the same types of supply-and-demand forces we\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. What would cause the peso to appreciate? Either an increase in the demand\nfor pesos or a decrease in the supply of pesos.\nCurrency Depreciation\nJust as a currency can appreciate, it can depreciate. If the quote at the bank was\n, it\nwould only cost $0.0500 to purchase a Mexican peso. When it costs fewer dollars to purchase a peso, the peso\nhas depreciated. Either a decrease in demand for pesos or an increase in supply of pesos will cause the peso to\ndepreciate.\nBecause an exchange rate is the price of one currency expressed in terms of another currency, if one of the\ncurrencies depreciates, the other currency must, by definition, appreciate. If it costs $0.0500 to purchase a\nMexican peso, the price of a US dollar, in terms of a Mexican peso would be calculated as\nSo, the price of one US dollar would be 20 Mexican pesos.\nExchange Rate Risk\nBusinesses that engage in international business face currency exchange rate risk. As exchange rates change,\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\nrate is\n, the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange",

Looking at the percentage change in Figure 3.20 is helpful for\ndetecting when the economy is growing but the growth is slowing. If the percentage change is positive but\nlower than it was for the previous quarter, then GDP is growing, but the growth rate is slowing.\nIndexes\nAn index is created to track the performance of a particular aspect of the economy or the financial markets. An\nindex helps compare the level of a variable at one point in time relative to another point in time. Indexes are\noften used when movement over time is more important than the absolute level of the variable at any one\npoint in time.\nEarlier in this chapter, we looked at the rate of change in the CPI to measure the rate of inflation. In its raw\nform, the CPI is an index. Remember that the CPI is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods. When\nthe index is created, the total cost of the market basket, whether it is $300 or $950, is irrelevant. What\neconomists are interested in is the magnitude of the difference in cost of the same market basket at a later\ndate.\nIn order to focus on the change over time, a base year is identified.

Let’s assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same\nbasket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index\nlevel increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare\ndifferent measures of inflation.\nFor example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In\nthe base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of\nthe 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United\nStates allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.\nTable 3.6 contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year\nof 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that\nJapan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same\nfrom one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n3.2 Macroeconomics\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n3.4 Interest Rates\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.

If a currency will purchase\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\nhave depreciated.\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis.

In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\nThe Accounting Equation\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nThe Accounting Equation\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\ndegree pursued.\nSolution:\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\naccounting value of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and\nservices) increase the accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\n105\nLikewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) decrease the value of the organization. So\neach dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same\napproach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statements:\n•\nGains increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nLosses decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nInvestments by owners increase the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nDistributions to owners decrease the value (equity) of the organization.\n•\nChanges in assets and liabilities can either increase or decrease the value (equity) of the organization\ndepending on the net result of the transaction.\nLet’s look at Chris’s Landscaping business again and do the same quick exercise you did with your personal\nfinances. If we were to total all of Chris’s assets, we would find just one: $250 in cash. She’s using the family’s\ntractor, but she doesn’t own the tractor, so it is not her asset. Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash",

Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0. Using the\naccounting equation, we find her equity to currently be $250, or\nDouble-Entry Accounting\nAccounting is based on a double-entry accounting system, which requires the following:\n•\nEach time we record a transaction, we must record a change in at least two different accounts. Having two\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\n•\nNot only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\nimpacted.\n•\nThe sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple\nbut detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\nDebits and Credits\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary. We can illustrate\neach account type and its corresponding debit and credit effects in the form of an expanded equation (see\nFigure 4.4).\n106\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 4.4 Expanded Accounting Equation\nAs we can see from this expanded accounting equation, Assets accounts increase on the debit side and\ndecrease on the credit side. This is also true of Dividends and Expenses accounts. Liabilities increase on the\ncredit side and decrease on the debit side. This is also true of Common Stock and Revenues accounts. This\nbecomes easier to understand as you become familiar with the normal balance of an account.\nThe balance sheet is a reflection of the accounting equation (see Figure 4.5). It has two sections, assets in one\nsection and liabilities and equity in the other section. It’s key to note that both assets and liabilities are broken\ndown on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to provide more detail and\ntransparency. Current assets are those that are consumed within a year. Assets that will be in use longer than\na year are considered noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be due within a year. Noncurrent\nliabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future.\nFigure 4.5 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent. Also highlighted are the various activities that affect the equity (or net worth) of the business.\nNotice each account subcategory (Current Assets and Noncurrent Assets, for example) has an “increase” side\nand a “decrease” side. As you may recall, these are called T-accounts, and they are used to analyze\ntransactions.\nThe basic components of even the simplest accounting system are accounts and a general ledger. An account\nis a record showing increases and decreases to assets, liabilities, and equity—the basic components found in\nthe accounting equation. Each of these categories, in turn, includes many individual accounts, all of which a\ncompany maintains in its general ledger. A general ledger is a comprehensive listing of all of a company’s\naccounts with their individual balances.\n4.3\nHow Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the revenue recognition principle and how it relates to current and future sales transactions.\n•\nExplain the expense recognition principle and how it relates to current and future purchase transactions.\n•\nAssess the role of ethics in revenue and expense recognition.",

In our current example, Chris’s landscaping business, the “revenue,” or the value of services\n4.3 • How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\n107\nperformed, for the month of August would be $1,400. It is the value Chris received in exchange for the services\nprovided to her clients. Likewise, when a business provides goods or services to customers for cash at the time\nof the service or in the future, the business classifies the amount(s) as revenue. Just as the $1,400 revenues\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCoffee Shop Products\nThink about a coffee shop in your area. Identify items the coffee shop sells that would be classified as\nrevenues. Remember, revenues for the coffee shop are related to its primary purpose: selling coffee and\nrelated items. Or, better yet, make a trip to the local coffee shop and get a first-hand experience.\nSolution:\nMany coffee shops earn revenue through multiple revenue streams, including coffee and other specialty\ndrinks, food items, gift cards, and merchandise.\nShort-Term Revenue Recognition Examples\nTwo brief examples may help illustrate the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting.\nAssume that a business sells $200 worth of merchandise. In some businesses, there are two ways the\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,\nwith the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded\nuntil May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded\nin the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be\nrecorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its\ncustomer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual\naccounting (see Figure 4.6).\nFigure 4.6 Credit versus Cash On the left is a credit sale recorded under the cash basis of accounting. On the right, the same credit\nsale is recorded under the accrual basis of accounting.\nLet’s now explore the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting using an expense.\n108\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAssume a business purchases $160 worth of printing supplies from a supplier (vendor). Similar to a sale, a\npurchase of merchandise can be paid for at the time of sale using cash (also a check or credit card) or at a later\ndate (on account).

Capitalization is the process by which a long-term asset is recorded on the balance sheet\nand its allocated costs are expensed on the income statement over the asset’s economic life.\nLong-term assets that are not used in daily operations are typically classified as an investment. For example, if\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\nthe land would be considered an investment.\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\nFundamentals of Depreciation\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\n1.\nRecord the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\noutflow of cash.\n2.\nAt the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\nestimated useful life.\nRecording the Initial Asset\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years. The journal entry to\nrecord the purchase is shown in Figure 4.10.\n114\n4 • Accrual Accounting Process\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 4.10 Journal Entry for Equipment/Cash\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nEstimating Useful Life and Salvage Value\nUseful life and salvage value are estimates made at the time an asset is placed in service. It is common and\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\nuseful life.\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\n•\nBook value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\n•\nUseful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\n•\nSalvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\nassets.\n•\nDepreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\n$10,000.",

The journal entry to record depreciation is shown in Figure 4.11.\n4\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission. “Waste Management, Inc.

It represents the\namount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\nthrough depreciation.\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\naccounting courses. Note that these methods are for accounting and reporting purposes. The IRS allows firms\nto use the same or different methods to depreciate assets in calculating taxable income.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFixed Assets\nYou work for Georgia-Pacific as an accountant in charge of the fixed assets subsidiary ledger at a\nproduction and warehouse facility in Pennsylvania. The facility is in the process of updating and replacing\nseveral asset categories, including warehouse storage units, fork trucks, and equipment on the production\nline.

You are excited about the new purchases and upgrades to the facility and\nhow they will help the company serve its customers better.

Liam pays shipping costs of $1,500\nand setup costs of $2,500 and assumes a useful life of five years or 960,000 prints. Based on experience, Liam\nanticipates a salvage value of $10,000. Recall that determination of the costs to be depreciated requires\nincluding all costs that prepare the asset for use by the company. Liam’s example would include shipping and\nsetup costs. Any costs for maintaining or repairing the equipment would be treated as regular expenses, so\nthe total cost would be $58,000, and after allowing for an anticipated salvage value of $10,000 in five years, the\nbusiness could take $48,000 in depreciation over the machine’s economic life (see Figure 4.12).\nFigure 4.12 Purchase Price and Depreciable Base\nStraight-line depreciation is a method of depreciation that evenly splits the depreciable amount across the\nuseful life of the asset. Therefore, we must determine the yearly depreciation expense by dividing the\ndepreciable base of $48,000 by the economic life of five years, giving an annual depreciation expense of\n$9,600. The journal entries to record the first two years of expenses are shown, along with the balance sheet\ninformation. Here are the journal entry and information for year one (Figure 4.13):\nFigure 4.13 Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 1\nAfter the journal entry in year one, the machine would have a book value of $48,400. This is the original cost of\n$58,000 less the accumulated depreciation of $9,600. The journal entry and information for year two are shown\nin Figure 4.14.\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\n117\nFigure 4.14 Journal Entry for Silk Screen Machine Depreciation Expense, Year 2\nLiam records an annual depreciation expense of $9,600. Each year, the accumulated depreciation balance\nincreases by $9,600, and the machine’s book value decreases by the same $9,600. At the end of five years, the\nasset will have a book value of $10,000, which is calculated by subtracting the accumulated depreciation of\nfrom the cost of $58,000.\nUnits-of-Production Depreciation\nStraight-line depreciation is efficient accounting for assets used consistently over their lifetime, but what about\nassets that are used with less regularity? The units-of-production depreciation method bases depreciation on\nthe actual usage of the asset, which is more appropriate when an asset’s life is a function of usage instead of\ntime. For example, this method could account for depreciation of a silk screen machine for which the\ndepreciable base is $48,000 (as in the straight-line method), but now the number of prints is important.\nIn our example, the machine will have total depreciation of $48,000 over its useful life of 960,000 prints.\nTherefore, we would divide $48,000 by 960,000 prints to get a cost per print of $0.05. If Liam printed 180,000\nitems in the first year, the depreciation expense would be\n. The\njournal entry to record this expense would be the same as with straight-line depreciation: only the dollar\namount would have changed. The presentation of accumulated depreciation and the calculation of the book\nvalue would also be the same. Liam would continue to depreciate the asset until a total of $48,000 in\ndepreciation was taken after running 960,000 total prints.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nDeciding on a Depreciation Method\nLiam is struggling to determine which deprecation method they should use for their new silk screen\nmachine. They expect sales to increase over the next five years. They also expect (hope) that in two years\nthey will need to buy a second silk screen machine to keep up with the demand for products of their\ngrowing company. Which depreciation method makes more sense for Liam: higher expenses in the first few\nyears or keeping expenses consistent over time? Or would it be better for them to think not in terms of\ntime, but rather in the usage of the machine?\nDouble-Declining-Balance Depreciation\nThe double-declining-balance depreciation method is the most complex of the three methods because it\naccounts for both time and usage and takes more expense in the first few years of the asset’s life. Double\ndeclining considers time by determining the percentage of depreciation expense that would exist under",

However, “management teams typically fail to invest either time or attention into\nmaking or periodically revisiting and revising reasonably supportable estimates of asset lives or salvage\nvalues, or the selection of depreciation methods, as prescribed by GAAP.”5 This failure is not an ethical\napproach to properly accounting for the use of assets.\nAccountants need to analyze depreciation of an asset over the entire useful life of the asset. As an asset\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,\n“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the\nquality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and\ncharges to operations as disposal gains.”7 An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate\nthe expense of an asset according to its usage.\n5\nHoward B.

Under normal circumstances, this might have been considered just\nanother accounting fiasco leading to the end of a company. However, WorldCom controlled a large\npercentage of backbone routes, a major component of the hardware supporting the internet, as even the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission recognized. If such an event were to happen today, it could shut\ndown international commerce and would be considered a national emergency.10 As demonstrated by\nWorldCom, the unethical behavior of a few accountants could have shut down the world’s online\nbusinesses and international commerce.

            "chunk": "specific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\nrather than a net loss.\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\nSales and Gross Profit\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\nfuture results.\nFirms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin\ngross profit/sales.) Cost of\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\ntheir Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.\nTheir cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell. In the link to learning, you will explore\nApple, a technology manufacturer. Their cost of goods would include the cost to manufacture the goods they\n130\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsell. Another type of firm is a service firm. A law office, for example, would include primarily the cost of labor in\ntheir cost of services.\nGross profit is a reflection of how profitable the firm’s performance was in its core business function. It\nincludes only the core business and direct costs of performing that business. If the company were a shoe\ncompany, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply making the shoes it sold. If it\nwere a bakery, gross profit would show how profitable the company was in simply baking the goods it sold.\nGross profit shows financial statement users how effective the business is at generating top-line profits on\ntheir core business function. It does not reflect the performance of other areas of the firm such as other\noperating costs to support the direct production process, indirect costs, and financing.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see its gross profit in Figure 5.2.

Does it\nreflect any change in performance over time (earning more or less gross profit on its gross sales)?\nIncome from Operations\nGross profit is a very helpful measure, but it is only the first of several provided by the income statement. After\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses. To sell its hunting and fishing equipment in the current year, Clear Lake\nSporting Goods paid rent for its building ($5,500) and utilities for its retail and warehouse spaces ($2,500);\nrecorded depreciation on equipment, buildings, and store furnishings (shelves, racks, etc.) ($3,600); and paid\nsalaries to its indirect employees in accounting, purchasing, and human resources ($5,400). The company’s\noperating expenses are deducted from gross profit to arrive at operating income\nWhile gross profit reflects only how profitable the firm was in making its core product, operating income\n5.1 • The Income Statement\n131\nreflects how profitable the firm’s daily operations were as a whole. This still does not include other\nmiscellaneous items outside the scope of a firm’s normal business. Just as the name implies, it shows income\nfrom the core operations of the firm.\nFigure 5.3 Income Statement through Income from Operations\nWe can see that the company was able to generate\nmore in net sales in the\ncurrent year than the prior year. However, it only generated\nin gross profit and\nof additional operating income. Further investigation shows that while net sales\nincreased, so did the direct costs of its goods (COGS) and its operating expenses.\nWe will further explore how to assess each of these expenses later in the chapter using common-size analysis.\nCommon-size analysis reflects each element of a financial statement as a percentage of the base. In the case\nof the income statement, the base is net sales. Here we would see that COGS was 50 percent of net sales in\nboth the current\nand prior year\n, indicating there wasn’t any significant\nchange in performance we could detect from the information provided in the income statement.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nOperating Expenses\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Have any of the operating expenses changed significantly? How did that impact the company’s\noperating income? What might it tell you about the company’s performance?\nNet Income\nFinally, we move on to net income, or what is commonly referred to as the bottom line. Net income (or loss)\nreflects the net impact of all financial transactions for the firm, including those that are caused by events\noutside the normal course of business. The most common items deducted from operating income to arrive at\nnet income include interest expense, gains/losses, and income tax expense. Remember, gains and losses are\nthose that result from unusual transactions outside the normal course of business. Examples include selling a\npiece of old equipment or a loss on retiring debt.\nWe can see in Figure 5.4 that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has outstanding debt, so it incurred interest expense\n132\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof $2,000 in the current year and $3,000 the prior year.

Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”\nThis is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of\ncleaning supplies.\nFigure 5.6 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\nnoncurrent.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.\nIt rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets.

(Amounts are in\nmillions.)\nWe’ve covered the assets side of the accounting equation; now let’s turn our attention to the other side of the\nequation and the other two sections of the balance sheet: liabilities and equity. Just like the assets section, the\nliabilities section is broken down between current and noncurrent. Current liabilities are those that will be\ndue within a year. Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and\nunearned revenue. Noncurrent liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes\npayable is a common noncurrent liability.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it\nhasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts\npayable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities. The note payable is not due for several years, thus\nmaking it a noncurrent liability (see Figure 5.8).\nFigure 5.8 Liability Section of Classified Balance Sheet\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent and Noncurrent Liabilities\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What is the amount of the\ncompany’s total assets for the most recent year? What is the amount of its total liabilities and equity?\nSolution:\nApple’s total assets for 2020 were $323,888, and its total liabilities and equity were also $323,888. (Amounts\nare in millions.)\nImportance of the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have gone to all the work to carefully assemble a classified balance sheet, what do we use it for?\nThe answer lies within the accounting equation itself. Think of the accounting equation from a “sources and\nclaims” perspective. Under this approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by\nincurring liabilities or were provided by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by\ncreditors and/or owners. The balance sheet shows us what the firm has (its assets), who owns them (equity),\nand who the firm owes (its liabilities).\nLimitations of the Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet is indeed a very helpful financial statement, but it also poses challenges. First, assets on the\nbalance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are recorded at historical cost.\nHistorical cost is simply the cost paid for the item at the time it was purchased. Changes in market value of big-\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and\ndepreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated\ndepreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen\non the balance sheet.\nEstimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for\ndoubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating\ndepreciation is another common estimate. If these estimates are incorrect, the net value of the asset can be\nunder- or overstated.\nAnother key limitation is the fact that a balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time. This\n5.2 • The Balance Sheet\n137\nmeans that the account value could have been quite different on the day before or the day after the date of\nthe balance sheet. For example, if a firm were concerned with certain ratios or investor/lender expectations of\nits cash balance, it could choose to not pay several vendor payments in the last week of December. Thus, on\nDecember 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week\nof January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.\nFinally, there are many possible things of value that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Internally\ngenerated assets and the firm’s human capital are two common examples. Internally generated assets can be\nanything from a website, a process, to an idea.\n5.3\nThe Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify connected elements between the balance sheet and the income statement.\n•\nDifferentiate between expenses and payables.\nNet Income and Retained Earnings\nAs mentioned earlier, the financial statements are linked by certain elements and thus must be prepared in a\ncertain order. The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.",

Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings\nNow we can see the full flow of information from the income statement to the statement of retained earnings\n(Figure 5.10) and finally to the balance sheet.

Does it appear the company paid out dividends this year?\n5.3 • The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\n139\nExpenses versus Payables\nThere is another key relationship between the income statement and the balance sheet can often be confusing\nto non-accountants: an expense versus a payable. The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This\nmeans that every transaction has two sides: a debit and a credit. They must be equal. When Clear Lake records\nan expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction. In this case, the company incurred\nutilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts\npayable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable\nand reduce cash.

The statement of owner’s equity addresses the last segment of the accounting\nequation in detail by laying out the equity elements of the firm and highlighting changes in these elements\nthroughout the period.\nEquity represents the ownership of the firm. The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for\ncorporations contains two primary categories of accounts. The first is paid-in capital or contributed\ncapital—consisting of amounts paid in by owners. The second category is earned capital, consisting of\namounts earned by the corporation as part of business operations. On the balance sheet, retained earnings is\na key component of the earned capital section, while the stock accounts such as common stock, preferred\nstock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary components of the contributed capital section.\nCommon stock represents ownership in the firm. Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\nadditional paid-in capital account.\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\nstock and retained earnings. Common stock in the prior year was $75,000 and increased to $80,000 in the\ncurrent year, indicating Clear Lake issued additional common stock (see Figure 5.13).\nFigure 5.13 Stockholder Equity Section of Balance Sheet\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nEquity Accounts\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What types of equity accounts does it report?\nSolution:\nApple reports common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income.\nDistributions to Owners\nWhen firms earn a profit, they have two options as to what to do with their earnings. They can keep (retain)\nthem and reinvest them back into the business, or they can pay them out to their shareholders in the form of\ndividends. Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\nother assets as well.\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\nexisting shareholders.\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\ncash for other investments.\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding. Treasury\nshares are not outstanding, so no dividends are declared or distributed for these shares. Regardless of the\ntype of dividend, the declaration always causes a decrease in the retained earnings account.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nDividends\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Each\n142\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfollowing line provides information on any events during the period that changed the value of any of the\naccounts.

They had just two events to report in their statement that impacted their equity accounts; they\nreported net income and they issued dividends (see Figure 5.14).\nFigure 5.14 Statement of Stockholder Equity for Clear Lake Sporting Goods\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCash Flows\nKhan Academy (https://openstax.org/l/50CashFlowsVid) explains cash flows in a unique way.\n5.5\nThe Statement of Cash Flows\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nOutline the purpose and importance of the statement of cash flows.\n•\nIdentify the structure and key elements of the statement of cash flows.\nThe final financial statement is the statement of cash flows. It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n143\nconsumed by events outside the firm’s normal course of business.\nThere are two key methods of preparing the statement: direct and indirect.

FASB (Financial Accounting\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\ncash basis, or cash flow.\nOperating Activities\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).\nAs mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the\nfirm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\n144\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 5.15 Comparative Income Statements and Balance Sheets\nClear Lake’s statement of cash flows begins with the current year net income of $35,000 from the income\nstatement. Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\ncash flow.\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\nmove closer to cash. Accounts payable and unearned revenue, both liability accounts, increased. Since these\nare liabilities, an increase would indicate that the liability was incurred but not as quickly paid out; thus it is an\nincrease to the statement.\nTallying all these adjustments to net income shows Clear Lake’s net cash flows provided by operating activities\nof $53,600 (see Figure 5.16).\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows\n145\nFigure 5.16 Operating Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nInvesting Activities\nAs mentioned, investing activities include investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself\n(items like machinery, land, or other fixed assets). These are items that are capitalized (placed on the balance\nsheet and depreciated over time) and thus did not reduce net income. They did, however, cause an impact to\ncash flow (see Figure 5.17).\nDuring the current year, Clear Lake purchased an additional $5,000 in short-term investments (see the\ncomparative balances sheets; the balance in that account increased by $5,000 since the prior year). They also\npurchased additional plant assets in the amount of $13,600. This amount can be figured by comparing the\ndifference in the current and prior plant assets accounts and including the impact of current year depreciation\n($50,000 current year balance less $40,000 prior year balance and $3,600 of depreciation = $13,600 of new\nassets purchased).\nFigure 5.17 Investing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\nFinancing Activities\nRecall that financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business.

Common items in this\nsection of the statement include the payment of dividends, issuance of common or preferred stock, and\nissuance or payment of notes payable (see Figure 5.18).\nIn the current year, Clear Lake took out additional notes payable (a cash inflow). We can see this by the\nincrease in their notes payable account from the prior year to current year ($40,000 to $50,000). This is an\ninflow of cash and thus an increase on the statement. Dividends of $30,000 were paid to shareholders (found\non the statement of retained earnings and the statement of owner’s equity). Finally, we see that Clear Lake\nmust have issued additional common stock, as their common stock balance increased from $75,000 to $80,000.\nFigure 5.18 Financing Activities Section of the Statement of Cash Flows\n146\n5 • Financial Statements\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStatement of Cash Flows\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

This amount is then used to adjust the beginning cash balance from the balance sheet.\nAssuming the statement was prepared correctly, the sum should equal the ending cash balance on the\nbalance sheet.\nIn the full statement, we can see that Clear Lake has net cash flow of $20,000. The beginning cash balance was\n$90,000, making the ending cash balance $110,000 (see Figure 5.19).\nFigure 5.19 Full Statement of Cash Flows\nAnalyzing Performance\nThe statement of cash flows can be used in a number of ways to assess firm performance by both internal and\nexternal financial statement users.

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\noperational cash flow.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key",

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\nexternally.\nTime Period Principle\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What key highlights and challenges did the company report for the\nyear?\nSolution:\nAnswers may vary. A few key items of note might include risk factors, financial statements, the MD&A letter,\nand disclosures about market risk. Apple’s MD&A reported significant updates on the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a few financial updates, product updates, segment performance data, a conversation\nabout its debt, contractual obligations, and accounting policies.\nSEC Reporting Requirements\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to regularly provide several\nreports. The two most common are the 10-K and quarterly report (10-Q). Certain unique events also require an\nadditional filing called an 8-K. There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include\nchanges to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company\ncharter or bylaws.\nThe quarterly report is much like the annual report already discussed. It contains the firm’s financial\nstatements, required accounting disclosures, statements on internal control, and a management discussion\nand analysis (MD&A) letter. It does not contain an auditor’s report, as firms are not audited on a quarterly\nbasis. Quarterly reports are helpful to investors because they provide information on a timely enough basis to\nbe relevant.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInvestor Relations\nVisit the Apple, Inc. Investor Relations page, SEC Filings section (https://openstax.org/r/sec-filings). Notice\nhow many different reports Apple files regularly with the SEC. Locate the most recent quarterly (10-Q) and\nannual reports (10-K) and scan the table of contents. How does the quarterly report differ from the annual\nreport? Do you notice key items in the annual report not provided in the quarterly report?\n5.8 • Reporting Financial Activity\n157\nSummary\n5.1 The Income Statement\nThe income statement reflects a firm’s performance over a period of time. Most financial statements are\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\ndepict and support the accounting equation:\nA classified balance\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\nthe balance sheet.\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,\nadditional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, for example. Beginning balances are provided, and all key\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\ndividends.\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\nneeds for growth.\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.",

Figure 6.2 shows the comparative income statements and\nbalance sheets for the past two years.\nFigure 6.2 Comparative Income Statements and Year-End Balance Sheets Note that the comparative income statements and\n6.2 • Operating Efficiency Ratios\n167\nbalance sheets have been simplified here and do not fully reflect all possible company accounts.\nTo begin an analysis of receivables, it’s important to first understand the cycles and periods used in the\ncalculations.\nOperating Cycle\nA period is one operating cycle of a business. The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\nCash Conversion Cycle\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\nconversion cycle.\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other\ncurrent projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a\nhigh or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the\ntradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\ndebt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\nThe formula for accounts receivable turnover is\nNet credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\nreceivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”\nmay be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the\n168\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbeginning and ending balances in accounts receivable for the period. The beginning accounts receivable\nbalance is the same figure as the ending accounts receivable balance from the prior period.\nWhen computing the accounts receivable turnover for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, let’s assume net credit sales\nmake up $100,000 of the $120,000 of the net sales found on the income statement in the current year.\nTo gain a better understanding of its ratio performance, Clear Lake Sporting Goods can compare its turnover\nto industry averages, key competitors, and its own historical ratios. Given this outcome, the managers may\nwant to consider stricter credit lending practices to make sure credit customers are of a higher quality. They\nmay also need to be more aggressive with collecting any outstanding accounts.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nAccounts Receivable Turnover",

A company\nwould like to use as few assets as possible to generate the most net sales. Therefore, a higher total asset\nturnover means the company is using their assets very efficiently to produce net sales. The formula for total\nasset turnover is\nAverage total assets are found by dividing the sum of beginning and ending total assets balances found on the\nbalance sheet.

Over time, Clear Lake\nSporting Goods would like to see this turnover ratio increase.\nInventory Turnover\nInventory turnover measures how many times during the year a company has sold and replaced inventory.\nThis can tell a company how well inventory is managed. A higher ratio is preferable; however, an extremely\nhigh turnover may mean that the company does not have enough inventory available to meet demand. A low\nturnover may mean the company has too much supply of inventory on hand. The formula for inventory\nturnover is\nCost of goods sold for the current year is found on the income statement. Average inventory is found by\ndividing the sum of beginning and ending inventory balances found on the balance sheet. The beginning\ninventory balance in the current year is taken from the ending inventory balance in the prior year.\nClear Lake Sporting Goods’ inventory turnover is\nA ratio of 1.6 times seems to be a very low turnover rate for Clear Lake Sporting Goods. This may mean the\ncompany is maintaining too high an inventory supply to meet a low demand from customers. Managers may\nwant to decrease their on-hand inventory to free up more liquid assets to use in other ways. Keep in mind,\nratios should not be taken out of context. One ratio alone can’t tell the whole story. Ratios should be used with\ncaution and in conjunction with other ratios and additional financial and contextual information.\nAs with accounts receivable, there is a trade-off to consider in managing inventory. Low turnover will usually\n170\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmean a low risk of stockouts and the ability to carry more of what customers are looking for. But high\ninventory levels will mean that more cash is tied up in inventory. High turnover will mean carrying less\ninventory and the higher risk of stockouts, causing customers to go elsewhere to find what they need.\nFigure 6.4 Inventory turnover can help determine how well a company manages its inventory.

A\ncompany can take out loans, issue stock, and retain earnings to be used in future periods to keep operations\nrunning. A key difference in debt and equity is the interest expense repayment that a loan carries as opposed\nto equity, which does not have this requirement.

The formula for the debt-to-equity ratio is\nThe information needed to compute the debt-to-equity ratio for Clear Lake Sporting Goods in the current year\ncan be found on the balance sheet.\nThis means that for every one dollar of equity contributed toward financing, $1.50 is contributed from lenders.\nRecall that total assets equal total liabilities plus total equity. Both the debt-to-assets and debt-to-equity ratio\nhave total liabilities in the numerator. The difference in the two ratios is the denominator. The denominator for\nthe debt-to-equity ratio is total stockholder equity. The denominator for the debt-to-assets ratio is total assets,\nor total liabilities plus total equity. Thus, the two ratios contain the same information, making calculating both\nratios redundant. A financial analyst may prefer to calculate one ratio over the other because of the format of\nreadily available industry data to use for comparison purposes or for consistency with other calculations the\nanalyst is performing.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinancing a Business Expansion\nYou are the CFO of a small corporation.

This ability to pay is determined by the available earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are\ndeducted. These earnings are considered the operating income. Lenders will pay attention to this ratio before\nextending credit. The more times over a company can cover interest, the more likely a lender will extend long-\nterm credit.

To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).\n6.5 • Market Value Ratios\n177\nFigure 6.6 Weighted Shares\nIf the shares were not weighted, the calculation would not consider the time period during which the shares\nwere outstanding.\nTo illustrate how earnings per share is calculated, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods earns $35,000 in net\nincome during the current year. During the year, the company also declared a $5,000 dividend on preferred\nstock and a $6,000 dividend on common stock. The company had 8,000 common shares outstanding the entire\nyear. Clear Lake Sporting Goods has generated $3.75 of earnings ($35,000 less the $5,000 of preferred\ndividends) for each of the 8,000 common shares of stock it has outstanding.\nMeasuring Performance with Earnings per Share\nEarnings per share is a key profitability measure that both current and potential common stockholders\nmonitor. Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per\nshare on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\nreporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their\nincome statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted\nearnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks\nand bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFinding Earning per Share for Public Companies\nWhere can you find earnings per share information on public companies? Use the Yahoo! Finance\n(https://openstax.org/r/yahoo-finance) website to look up stock and earnings per share data for Tellurian\nInc. (TELL), Amazon (AMZN), or CVS Pharmacy (CVS). Or use the search function to search for earnings per\nshare data for your favorite corporation. Enter the ticker for the company you are looking up, and a basic\nchart and graph will display with stock price data along with several commonly used ratios (including\nearnings per share).\nAs you review data, keep in mind that a company can manipulate or impact its earnings per share by\nissuing new shares or buying back issued shares. What are the ethical implications of earnings per share\ncalculations?\nCommon stock shares are normally purchased by investors to generate income through dividends or to sell at\na profit in the future. Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent\ndividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share\namounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable\nperformance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase. One way earnings per share\ncan increase is through increased net income. On the other hand, it can also increase when a company buys\nback its own shares of stock.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods generated net income of $30,000 and paid out $3,000 in\n178\n6 • Measures of Financial Health\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npreferred shareholder dividends last year.

Nevertheless, they are often still published in\nother finance textbooks and are also available on the internet to use if you so choose.\nUsing Timelines to Organize TVM Information\nA useful tool for conceptualizing present value and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual,\n196\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nlinear representation of periods and cash flows over a set amount of time. Each timeline shows today at the\nleft and a desired ending, or future point (maturity date), at the right.\nNow, let us take an example of a future value problem that has a time frame of five years. Before we begin to\nsolve for any answers, it would be a good approach to lay out a timeline like that shown in Table 7.1:\nYear\n0\n(Today)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTable 7.1\nThe timeline provides a visual reference for us and puts the problem into perspective.\nNow, let’s say that we are interested in knowing what today’s balance of $100 in our saving account, earning\n5% annually, will be worth at the end of each of the next five years. Using the future value formula\nthat we covered earlier, we would arrive at the following values: $105 at the end of year one, $110.25 at the\nend of year two, $115.76 at the end of year three, $121.55 at the end of year four, and $127.63 at the end of\nyear five.\nWith the numerical information, the timeline (at a 5% interest or growth rate) would look like Table 7.2:\nYear\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n$100.00 $105.00 $110.25 $115.76 $121.55 $127.63\nTable 7.2\nUsing timelines to lay out TVM problems becomes more and more valuable as problems become more\ncomplex.

Financial\ncalculators such as the Texas Instruments BAII Plus™ Professional (https://openstax.org/r/baii-plus-\nprofessional) will typically have five keys that represent the critical variables used in most common TVM\nproblems: NN, I/Y\nI/Y, PV\nPV, FV\nFV, and PMT\nPMT. These represent the following:\nThese are the only keys on a financial calculator that are necessary to solve TVM problems involving a single\npayment or lump sum.\nExample 1: Future Value of a Single Payment or Lump Sum\nLet’s start with a simple example that will provide you with most of the skills needed to perform TVM functions\ninvolving a single lump sum payment with a financial calculator.\n7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\n197\nSuppose that you have $1,000 and that you deposit this in a savings account earning 3% annually for a period\nof four years. You will naturally be interested in knowing how much money you will have in your account at the\nend of this four-year time period (assuming you make no other deposits and withdraw no cash).\nTo answer this question, you will need to work with factors of $1,000, the present value (PV\nPV); four periods or\nyears, represented by NN; and the 3% interest rate, or I/Y\nI/Y. Make sure that the calculator register information is\ncleared, or you may end up with numbers from previous uses that will interfere with the solution. The register-\nclearing process will depend on what type of calculator you are using, but for the TI BA II Plus™ Professional\ncalculator, clearing can be accomplished by pressing the keys 2ND\n2ND and FV\nFV [CLR TVM].\nOnce you have cleared any old data, you can enter the values in the appropriate key areas: 4 for NN, 3 for I/Y\nI/Y,\nand 1000 for PV\nPV.

This is because most financial calculators\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the -- (minus) key).\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-\n+|- key instead of the minus key. If you\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-\n+|- key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the\nfuture value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n198\n7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nof 4.

You\nhave $2,000 invested in a money market account that is expected to earn 4% annually.

Once again, if we enter a negative value for the FV, then the calculated PV will be a positive amount.\nTaking the reverse of what we did in our example of future value above, we can enter -1,125.51 for FV\nFV, 3 for\nI/Y\nI/Y, and 4 for NN. Hit the CPT\nCPT and PV\nPV keys in succession, and you should arrive at a displayed answer of 1,000.\nAn important constant within the time value of money framework is that the present value will always be less\nthan the future value unless the interest rate is negative. It is important to keep this in mind because it can\nhelp you spot incorrect answers that may arise from errors with your input.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nHow to Determine Present Value When Other Variables Are Known\nHere is another example of using a financial calculator to solve a common time value of money problem.",

As an example, in the spreadsheet\nshown in Figure 7.3, we calculated that the future value of $100 five years from now at a 5% interest rate would\nbe $127.63. By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%\ninterest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the\nPV function is used to determine present value (see Figure 7.7).\nFigure 7.7 Using the PV Function in Excel\nThe formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also\nsimilar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6.

Our present value and future value are the same as in that\nexample, and our time period is now 8.5 years, which is just under the result we arrived at (8.77 years) in\n7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\n213\nthe periods example.\nSo, if we are now working with a slightly shorter time frame for the savings to grow from $15,000 into\n$25,000, then we would expect to have a slightly greater growth rate. That is exactly how the answer turns\nout, as the calculated required interest rate of approximately 6.19% is just slightly greater than the growth\nrate of 6% used in the previous example. So, based on this, it looks like our answer here passes a simple\n“sanity check” review.\n7.4\nApplications of TVM in Finance\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the time value of money can impact your personal financial goals.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to inflation.\n•\nExplain how the time value of money is related to financial risk.\n•\nExplain how compounding period frequency affects the time value of money.\nSingle-Period Scenario\nLet’s say you want to buy a new car next year, and the one you have your eye on should be selling for $20,000\na year from now. How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?\nEssentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest\nover the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\nback to the current period.\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\nthe FV equation, we can turn\ninto\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest",

When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\nand advertised rate.\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of\nfinance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at\n5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age\n30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much\nof a difference? We’ll see that indeed they can, and the calculations required to prove it can take less than two\nminutes.\nAs another example, many professionals confuse income and wealth during their career growth. In their\npopular book The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America’s Wealthy, authors Thomas Stanley\nTime Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\n8\n8 • Why It Matters\n227\nand William Danko illustrate these terms with a flowing river. A river is in constant movement, and as the flow\nor depth increases, this is comparable to one’s income increasing through the promotions, salary increases,\nand bonuses one receives. Unfortunately, many individuals then increase their spending habits in response,\njustifying a better car, a second home, or more lavish vacations. Wealth, in contrast, is comparable to taking a\nbucket of water from the river and holding it aside in a tank for oneself. Financial professionals often call this\n“paying yourself first.” Stanley and Danko list this among the “secrets” referenced in the title of their book.\n8.1\nPerpetuities\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine perpetuity.\n•\nExplain how perpetuities are valued.\nIn Time Value of Money I, we learned that the value of money changes with the passage of time. Decision-\nmakers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into\nthe future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past\nperiods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving\nforward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to\nvisualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.\nThroughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount. In this chapter,\nwe deal with a stream of payments made periodically—in other words, payments made or received regularly\nover a span of time. We begin with the illustration of a perpetuity.\nWhat Is a Perpetuity?\nA perpetuity is a series of payments or receipts that continues forever, or perpetually. One of the best ways to\nanalyze the basics of an annuity (the stream of payments to be paid or received in the future) is by starting\nwith a perpetuity. The most common examples of perpetuities in the author’s experience are college chair\nendowments and preferred stock.\nIf you gift $1,500,000 to a college to name a professor’s chair for your family, you might specify that the money\nmust be held in perpetuity and invested by the college to yield a fixed 3%. The college will take those proceeds\nof the investment, leaving your original $1,500,000 intact, and use the annual interest of $45,000 to fund a\nportion of the professor’s salary.\nAnother common example is preferred stock. Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%",

In the case of a college chair endowment, a donor might gift a large sum of money to a college to name a professor's chair for their family, with the stipulation that the money must be held in perpetuity and invested to yield a fixed percentage. Preferred stock is another example, as most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined rate of dividend, creating a perpetuity if the dividend remains constant."

Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\nperpetuity.\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\n228\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninvestment valuations: the value of an investment generally represents our expectations of all future cash\nflows from that investment, discounted to today’s dollars.\nBecause a perpetuity is a stream of payments continuing indefinitely, determining the future value isn’t\npossible. Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\nrising prices.\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\nBy substitution,\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is\n, or $30.17.",

While we think of perpetuities as being static, with a constant benefit or dividend, as\nseen above, they might have the possibility of growth. Let’s assume that our preferred stock in Savo\nCorporation is expected to grow at a rate of 0.2% per year. Its annual dividend per share is $4.00, and its\nrequired rate of return in the market is 3%.

If you wish to gift the college enough funds to be held in perpetuity to produce $75,000\neach year for that professor, how would you calculate this?\nSolution:\nWe modify the constant perpetuity formula:\nIn one year, $2,142,857 grows to\nThe earnings (gift) of $75,000 are withdrawn to compensate the professor, and we are left with the amount\noriginally endowed, $2,142,857:\n230\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n8.2\nAnnuities\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine annuity.\n•\nDistinguish between an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.\n•\nCalculate the present value of an ordinary annuity and an annuity due.\n•\nExplain how annuities may be used in lotteries and structured settlements.\n•\nExplain how annuities might be used in retirement planning.\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments to be paid or received in the future. Present or future values\nof these streams of payments can be calculated by applying time value of money formulas to each of these\npayments. We’ll begin with determining the present value.\nBefore exploring present value, it’s helpful to analyze the behavior of a stream of payments over time. Assume\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year.

Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year.

We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity. Because the first payment will be received one year\nfrom now, we specifically call this an ordinary annuity. We will look at an alternative to ordinary annuities\nlater. How much money do we need in our fund today to accomplish this stream of payments if our remaining\nbalance will always be earning 8% annually? Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw\nperiodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.\n8.2 • Annuities\n231\nBefore we investigate a formula to calculate this amount, we can illustrate the objective: determining the\npresent value of this future stream of payments, either manually or using Microsoft Excel. We can take each of\nthe five payments of $25,000 and discount them to today’s value using the simple present value formula:\nwhere FV is the future value, PV is the present value, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\nFor example, the first $25,000 is discounted by the equation as follows:\nProof that $23,148.15 will grow to $25,000 in one year at 8% interest:\nIf we use this same method for each of the five years, increasing the exponent n for each year, we see the\nresult in Table 8.2.\nYear\nCalculation\nResult\n1\n$23,148.15\n2\n$21,433.47\n3\n$19,846.81\n4\n$18,375.75\n5\n$17,014.58\nTOTAL\n$99,818.76\nTable 8.2 Present Value of Future Payments\nWe begin with the amount calculated in our table, $99,818.76. Before any money is withdrawn, a year’s worth\nof interest at 8% is compounded and added to our balance. Then our first $25,000 is withdrawn, leaving us\nwith $82,804.26. This process continues until the end of five years, when, aside from a minor rounding\ndifference, the fund has “done its job” and is equal to zero. However, we can make this simpler. Because each\npayment withdrawn (or added, as we will see later) is the same, we can calculate the present value of an\nannuity in one step using an equation. Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following\nequation:\nwhere PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.\nIn this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years. Note that the greater the number of periods\nand/or the size of the amount borrowed, the greater the chances of large rounding errors. We have used six\ndecimal places in our calculations, though the actual time value of money factor, combining interest and time,\ncan be much longer. Therefore, our solutions will often use ≅ rather than the equal sign.\nBy substitution, and then following the proper order of operations:\n232\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIn both cases, barring a rounding difference caused by decimal expansion, we come to the same result using\nthe equation as when we calculate each of multiple years. It’s important to note that rounding differences can\nbecome significant when dealing with larger multipliers, as in the financing of a multimillion-dollar machine or\nfacility. In this text, we will ignore them.\nIn conclusion, five payments of $25,000, or $125,000 in total, can be funded today with $99,817.81, with the\ndifference being obtained from interest always accumulating on the remaining balance at 8%. The running\nbalance is obtained by calculating the year’s interest on the previous balance, adding it to that balance, and\nsubtracting the $25,000 that is withdrawn on the last day of the year. In the last (fifth) year, just enough\ninterest will accrue to bring the balance to the $25,000 needed to complete the fifth payment.\nA common use of the PVa is with large-money lotteries.

The Lottery\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission\nis offering you instead.\nBy substitution, and following the proper order of operations:\nAll things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119\ntoday. Now you can compare like numbers, and the $787,000 cash lump sum is worth more than the\ndiscounted future payments. That is the choice one would accept without considering such aspects as\ntaxation, desire, need, confidence in receiving the future payments, or other variables.\n8.2 • Annuities\n233\nCalculating the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nEarlier, we defined an ordinary annuity. A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\nfollows:\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\norder of operations:\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\namount.\nWe notice several things:\n1.",

If you can earn a 5% annual rate of interest, how much will you have if you\nbegin at age 20? What if you delay this program until age 30? The additional 10 years can make a\nsurprisingly large difference. How can you calculate that difference?\nSolution:\nPerform two separate calculations comparable to the chapter examples above, using the formula for the\nfuture value of an ordinary annuity. You plan to make the first investment immediately, making this an\nannuity due, so you will multiply by one additional period, (1 + 0.05). Notice that the only difference\nbetween the two calculations is the exponent N, representing the number of periods.\nThirty years (starting at age 30):\nForty years (starting at age 20):\nWaiting 10 years before committing to this program comes with a surprisingly high cost—a loss of almost\n82% of the potential value.\nHow Annuities Are Used for Retirement Planning\nOn a final note, how might annuities be used for retirement planning? A person might receive a lump-sum\nwindfall from an investment, and rather than choosing to accept the proceeds, they might decide to invest the\nsum (ignoring taxes) in an annuity. Their intention is to let this invested sum produce annual distributions to\nsupplement Social Security payments. Assume the recipient just received $75,000, again ignoring tax effects.\nThey have the chance to invest in an annuity that will provide a distribution at the end of each of the next five\nyears, and that annuity contract provides interest at 3% annually. Their first receipt will be one year from now.\nThis is an ordinary annuity.\nWe can also solve for the payment given the other variables, an important aspect of financial analysis. If the\nperson with the $75,000 windfall wants this fund to last five years and they can earn 3%, then how much can\nthey withdraw from this fund each year? To solve this question, we can apply the present value of an annuity\nformula. This time, the payment (PYMT) is the unknown, and we know that the PVa, or the present value that\nthey have at this moment, is $75,000:\n238\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe person can withdraw this amount every year beginning one year from now, and when the final payment is\nwithdrawn, the fund will be depleted. Interest accrues each year on the beginning balance, and then\n$16,376.60 is withdrawn at the end of each year.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAnother View of Annuities\nMany examples of annuities are available, with presentations as varied as the opinions as to how\nappropriate they are for investors, especially retirees. Math Is Fun (https://openstax.org/r/Math_Is_Fun) is\nparticularly interesting and potentially helpful for understanding how to apply this knowledge.\n8.3\nLoan Amortization\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between different types of loans.\n•\nExplain how amortization works.\n•\nCreate an amortization schedule.\n•\nCalculate the cost of borrowing.\nTypes of Loans\nFunds can be loaned to businesses of any type, including corporations, partnerships, limited liability\ncompanies, and proprietorships. Bankers often refer to these lending structures as facilities, and they can be\ntailored to the specific needs of the borrower in a number of ways. Similarly, lenders develop loans and lines of\ncredit for individuals. Whether for a business or an individual, the purpose of the loan, method of repayment,\ninterest rate, specific terms, and time involved must all be tailored to the goals of the borrower and the lender.\nIn this chapter, we will focus on fixed-rate loans, although other alternatives exist.\nTypical business loans include the following:\n•\nTerm loans generally bear a maturity date and a set rate of interest and are typically used to finance\ninvestments in assets such as equipment, buildings, and possibly other acquired firms. The length of the\nterm loan is generally designed to match the useful life of the asset being financed, and it will usually be\nrepaid on a monthly schedule. It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset\nitself or other assets of the business.\n•\nRevolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a\nbusiness. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest\naccrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility. These credit lines may\nbe secured by accounts receivable, inventory, other assets of the business, or sometimes simply the good\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n239\nfaith and credit of the company if the firm is strong, creditworthy, and established with the lender.",

You need to know if you can squeeze the\nmonthly payment into your budget.

In addition, the debt is decreasing slowly in the early months and more rapidly in the later\n8.3 • Loan Amortization\n241\nmonths. We can all agree that lenders are compensated for the risks they take earlier rather than later. Of the\n36 payments of $973.50, $32,000 has been repaid as the principal borrowed. The remaining $3,046.08 is the\nlender’s revenue, the cost of credit.\nFor an additional example, one that drives home the point that more interest is paid in the early months of a\nlong-term loan, we will consider a 20-year home mortgage. Home mortgage payments are typically made\nmonthly, and again, we will ignore additional charges by the lender, such as real estate tax and homeowner’s\ninsurance. Let’s assume you buy a $200,000 home, pay $60,000 as a cash deposit, and will finance the\nremaining $140,000 over 20 years. The bank offers you a 3.6% annual interest rate. What will the amount of\nyour monthly payment be for the interest and principal repayment? The bank will tell you, of course, but let’s\nprove it for ourselves. We’ll do it in exactly the same fashion as the car loan above, using the present value of\nan annuity formula. Remember that you are not financing the entire $200,000 purchase; you pay $60,000 in\ncash, so you are only financing the remaining $140,000.\nWe modify the periods from years to months by multiplying by 12, and we modify the annual rate to a monthly\nrate by dividing by 12, resulting in\nBy substitution into the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe divide both sides by 170.907667 to isolate the payment amount (PYMT):\nYour monthly mortgage payment is $819.16.

Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000\nborrowing.

Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\n8.4\nStated versus Effective Rates\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the difference between stated and effective rates.\n•\nCalculate the true cost of borrowing.\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates\n243\nunpaid balances. If you use this card only once, to make a $1,000 purchase in January, and then fail to pay the\nbill when it comes due, the issuer will bill you $15. Now you owe them $1,015. Assume you completely ignore\nthis bill and never pay it throughout the rest of the year. The monthly calculation of interest starts to\ncompound on past interest assessments in addition to the $1,000 initial purchase (see Table 8.6).\nMonth Interest Balance\n1,000.00\n1\n15.00 1,015.00\n2\n15.23 1,030.23\n3\n15.45 1,045.69\n4\n15.69 1,061.36\n5\n15.92 1.077.28\n6\n16.16 1,093.44\n7\n16.40 1,109.84\n8\n16.65 1,126.49\n9\n16.90 1,143.39\n10\n17.15 1,160.54\n11\n17.41 1,177.95\n12\n17.67 1,195.62\nTable 8.6 Compounded\nInterest on a Credit Card\nStatement ($)\nBecause interest compounds monthly rather than annually, the effective annual rate is 19.56%, not the\nintuitive rate of the stated 1.5% times 12 months, or 18%. Our basic compounding formula of (1+i)^n by\nsubstitution shows:\nTo isolate the effective annual rate, we then deduct 1 because our interest calculations are based on the value\nof $1:\nTherefore, it falls to the consumer/borrower to understand the true cost of borrowing, especially when larger\ndollar amounts are involved. If we had been dealing with $10,000 rather than $1,000, the annual difference\nwould be more than $156.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA Helpful Demonstration . . .\nFrom the Corporate Finance Institute (https://openstax.org/r/Corporate_Finance_Institute) comes a fine",

Yet while mastery of Excel requires extensive study and practice, enough\nbasics can be learned in two or three hours to provide the user with the ability to solve problems quickly and\nconveniently, including extensive financial capability. Most of the calculations in this chapter were prepared\nwith Excel.\nThe boxes in the Excel gridwork, known individually as cells (located at the intersection of a column and a row),\ncan contain numbers, text, and very powerful formulas (or functions) for calculations and data analytics. Cells,\nrows, columns, and groups of cells (ranges) are easily moved, formatted, and replicated. In the mortgage\namortization table for 240 months seen in Section 8.3.2, only the formulas for month 1 were typed in. With one\nsimple command, that row of formulas was replicated 239 more times, with each line updating itself with\nrelevant number adjustments automatically. With some practice, a long table such as that can be constructed\nby even a relatively new user in less than 10 minutes.\nIn this section, we will illustrate how to use Excel to solve problems from earlier in the chapter, including\nperpetuities, ordinary annuities, effective interest rates, and loan amortization. We will omit the basic\ndynamics of an Excel spreadsheet because they were presented sufficiently in preceding chapters.\nRevisiting the constant perpetuity from Section 8.1, in which our shares of Shaw Inc., preferred stock pay an\nannual fixed dividend of $2.00 and the required rate of return is 7%, we do not use an Excel function for this\nsimple operation. The two values are entered in cells B3 and B4, respectively.\nWe enter a formula in cell B6 to perform the division and display the result in that cell. The actual contents of\ncell B6 are typed below it for your reference, in cell B8 (see Figure 8.2).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n249\nFigure 8.2 Excel Spreadsheet for Valuing a Perpetuity\nDownload the spreadsheet file (https://openstax.org/r/spreadsheet_file_Chapter08_finance) containing\nkey Chapter 8 Excel exhibits.\nTo find the present value of an ordinary annuity, we revisit Section 8.2.1. You will draw $25,000 at the end of\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\ncommand is\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\n250\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.4 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Annuity Due\nSection 8.2 introduced us to future values. Comparable to the PV function above, Excel provides the FV\nfunction. Using the same information—$3,000 invested annually for five years, starting one year from now, at\n4%—we’ll solve using Excel (see Figure 8.5). The format of the command is\n=FV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\nFigure 8.5 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nAs with present values, using the same data but solving for an annuity due requires the fifth argument inside\nthe parentheses to be changed from 0 to 1; all other values remain the same (see Figure 8.6).\nFigure 8.6 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Future Value of an Annuity Due\nIn Section 8.4, we explained the difference between stated and effective rates of interest to show the true cost\nof borrowing, in this case for a one-year period, if interest is compounded for periods within a year.

The syntax\nfor the Excel effect function to calculate this rate is\n=EFFECT(rate,periods)\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n251\nwhere rate is the nominal rate and periods represents the number of periods within a year.\nEarlier, our example showed that 1.5% compounded monthly results in not 18% per year but actually over\n19.56% (see Figure 8.7).\nFigure 8.7 Excel Spreadsheet Showing Effective Interest Rate\nNote several things: First, the nominal interest rate is entered as a percent. Second, the actual effect function\nin C7 is typed as =EFFECT(rate,B7); we use the word rate because we actually assigned a name to cell B3, so\nExcel can use it in a function and replicate it without it changing. When cell C7 is replicated to C8 and C9, rate\nremains the same, but the formulas automatically adjust to use B8 and B9 for the periods.\nTo assign a name to a cell, keep in mind that every cell has column-row coordinates. We want cell B3 to be the\nanchor of our effective rate calculations. Rather than referring to cell B3, we can name it, and in this case, we\nuse the name rate, which we can then use in formulas like any other Excel cell letter-number reference. Place\nthe cursor in cell B3. Now, look at cell A1 on the grid: right above that cell, you see a box displaying B3, the\ncurrent cursor location. If you click in that box and type “rate” (without the quotation marks), as we did, then\nhit the enter key, the value in that box will change to rate. Now, if you type “rate” (again, without quotation\nmarks) into a formula, Excel knows to use the contents of cell B3.\nExcel provides convenient tools for figuring out amortization. We’ll revisit our 36-month auto loan for $32,000\nat 6% per year, compounded monthly. A loan amortization table for a fixed interest rate debt is usually\nformatted as follows, with the Interest and Principal columns interchangeable:\nPeriod\nPayment\nInterest\nPrincipal\nBalance\nIn Excel, a table is completed by using the function PMT. The individual steps follow.\n1.\nList the information about the loan in the upper left of the worksheet, and create the column headings for\nthe schedule of amortization. Type “B5” (without the quotation marks) in cell E9 to begin the schedule.\nThen enter 1 for the first month under the Payment # (or Month) column, in cell A10 (see Figure 8.8).\n252\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.8 Step 1 of Creating an Amortization Table\n2.\nNext, in cell B10, the payment is derived from the formula =PMT(rate,periods,pv), with PV representing the\npresent value, or the loan amount. Because we are compounding monthly, enter C$2 and C$3 for the rate\nand periods, respectively. Cell B5 is used for the loan amount, but notice the optional minus sign placed in\nfront of the entry B$5; this causes the results in the schedule to be displayed as positive numbers. The\ndollar sign ($) inserted in the cell references forces Excel to “freeze” those locations so that they don’t\nattempt to update when we replicate them later; this is known in spreadsheet programs as an absolute\nreference (see Figure 8.9).\nFigure 8.9 Step 2 of Creating an Amortization Table\n3.\nThe next step is to calculate the interest. We take the remaining balance from the previous line, in this\ncase cell E9, and multiply it by the monthly interest rate in cell C2, typing C$2 to lock in the reference. The\nremaining balance of the loan should always be multiplied by this monthly percentage (see Figure 8.10).\n8.5 • Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\n253\nFigure 8.10 Step 3 of Creating an Amortization Table\n4.\nBecause this is a fixed-rate loan, whatever is left from each payment after first deducting the interest\nrepresents principal, the amount by which the balance of the outstanding loan balance is reduced.\nTherefore, the contents of cell D10 represent B10, the total payment, minus C10, the interest portion (see\nFigure 8.11). No dollar signs are included because this cell reference can adjust to each row into which this\nformula is replicated, as will be seen in the following examples.\nFigure 8.11 Step 4 of Creating an Amortization Table\n5.\nBecause our principal portion of the last payment has reduced our outstanding balance, it is subtracted\nfrom the preceding balance in cell E9 (see Figure 8.12). The command therefore is =E9-D10.\n254\n8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 8.12 Step 5 of Creating an Amortization Table\nNow that the first full row is defined, an amortization schedule is easily developed by Excel’s replication",

But a\nprofessional decision maker must “hit it out of the park” when making major capital investment choices and\nrecommendations.\nAs a student in a course of business studies and career development, it is highly likely that you will be a\ndecision maker about projects that are likely to generate future cash flows but will also require a large initial\nexpense. When you ask your manager to invest $500,000 or more in a new piece of equipment that could help\nyour department meet or exceed its goals, you must be prepared to defend your request. Competing\nmanagers and departments will be asking for similar funding, and there simply might not be enough for\neveryone. This decision process requires financial analysis.\nMark Cuban of Shark Tank fame enjoys citing the series’ catchphrase: “Know thy numbers.” As a business\nprofessional, you must be able to assess potential profit against expenditures to be successful. In most cases,\nthis is based on our understanding of cash flow. A major capital investment might seem initially like a gamble,\nbut it is a gamble that can be hedged in your favor with understanding, analysis, and knowledge of your\nnumbers.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to give you information and instruction on how this is done. The techniques we\nwill discuss in this chapter will clarify decisions that must be made in the process of investing in a business.

If a stream of payments occurs in\nwhich the amount of the payments changes at any point, the techniques for solving for annuities must be\nmodified. Shortcuts that we have seen in earlier chapters cannot be taken. Fortunately, with tools such as\nfinancial or online calculators and Microsoft Excel, the method can be quite simple.\nThe ability to analyze and understand cash flow is essential.

The problem above takes each annual\ninvestment and compounds it into the future, then adds the results of each calculation to find the total future\nvalue of the stream of payments.\nBut when you break the problem down, another way to look at the problem is as a five-year annuity of $10,000\nper year plus added payments in years 4 and 5. Can we solve for the future value of an annuity first and then\nperform two separate calculations on the additional amounts ($5,000 each in years 4 and 5)?

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\nsuccess.\n270\n9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAA: In your bio, you mention liquidity management. Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\nventures?\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\nharder it is to break bad habits.

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\nterminology, coupon payments.\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\nBonds and Bond Valuation\n10\n10 • Why It Matters\n283\nadding a degree of safety and diversity to their investment mix.\n10.1\nCharacteristics of Bonds\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nList and define the basic characteristics of bonds.\n•\nList and describe the various types of bonds available.\n•\nExplain how a bond price is inversely related to its return (yield).\nBonds as Investments\nOne way to look at bond investments is to consider the fact that any investor who purchases a bond is\nessentially buying a future cash flow stream that the bond issuer (or borrower) promises to make as per\nagreement.\nBecause bonds provide a set amount of cash inflow to their owners, they are often called fixed-income\nsecurities. Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\nsale is completed.\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInformational Basics on Bonds\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\nBasic Terminology\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\n•\nPar value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\nof issue.\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\nforms of bonds and investments.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGovernment Bonds\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\nCorporate Bonds\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\n286\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Global Bond Market versus the Global Stock Market\nBonds have long been a trusted investment vehicle for many investors. Though the global fixed-income debt\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\nconclusions about these markets.\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\nrisk associated with stock.\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.",

When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase.

Rates for floating-rate bonds are typically tied to a benchmark interest rate that exists in the\neconomy. Common benchmark rates include the US Treasury note rate, the Federal Reserve funds rate\n(federal funds rate), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the prime rate.\nSo, investors who decide to purchase normal (fixed rate) bonds may not be thrilled to hear that the economy is\nsignaling inflation and that interest rates are forecasted to rise. These bond investors are aware that when\ninterest rates rise, their bond investments will lose value. This is not the case with floating- or variable-rate\nbonds.\nBonds with very low coupon rates are referred to as deep discount bonds. Of course, the bond that has the\ngreatest discount is the zero-coupon bond, with a coupon rate of zero. The smaller the coupon rate, the\ngreater the change in price when interest rates move.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRelationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\nReview this video (https://openstax.org/r/relationship-bond-prices) explaining the relationship between\nbond prices and interest rates within financial and capital markets.\n10.2\nBond Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDetermine the value (price) of a bond.\n•\nUnderstand the characteristics of and differences between discount and premium bonds.\n•\nDraw a timeline indicating bond cash flows.\n•\nDifferentiate between fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds.\n•\nDetermine bond yields.\nPricing a Bond in Steps\nWhy do we want to learn how to price a bond? The answer goes to the heart of finance: the valuation of\nassets. We need to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. What is its value\nto these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\nfrom willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you\nwant to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.\nLet’s begin our pricing examples with the 3M Company corporate bond listed in Table 10.1 above. The table\n288\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ninformation tells us that 3M issued a series of corporate bonds that promise to pay coupons annually on\nSeptember 19 and to pay back the principal, or face value, on the maturity date of September 19, 2026. While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.",

Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,\nthe $1,000 par value of the bond—at the maturity date of September 19, 2026. We can set out the future cash\nflows for the bond as shown in Table 10.2:\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n289\nYear\n(Period)\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nCoupons $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50 $22.50\nPrincipal\n$1,000\nTable 10.2\nNote that annual coupon payments are made each year on September 19, and the first annual coupon\npayment date is September 19, 2012. The annual payments continue for 15 years, with the last payment being\nmade on September 19, 2026. At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments. For now, we\nwill jump to the answer and simply use the YTM of 1.24% from the bond data in Table 10.1. Later in the\nchapter, we will develop the concepts behind how an appropriate discount rate is determined.\nFor Step 3, we now apply two equations to the set of future cash flows from the bond. This will then provide us\nwith the present values of these cash flows, or the expected present-day value of the bond. Because we know\nthat the coupon payments constitute an annuity stream, we can use the equation for the present value of an\nannuity (discussed in Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments. To value the one-time par value\npayment, we use the equation for the present value of a lump sum payment. So, by combining these, we will\nhave the present value of the coupon payment stream, or\nSo, for our example above, this becomes\nNext, we need to determine the present value of the payment of the par or face value of the bond at maturity.\nThis is calculated as follows:\nInserting our values into this formula gives us\nAdding the present values of the two payment streams gives us\nOur bond price is $1,137.47. This bond price represents the value of the financial asset to both a willing buyer\nand a willing seller.\nIn this example, the willing seller is 3M Company. The willing buyer is an investor who is demanding a 1.24%\nyield on the investment. As per Table 10.1 above, the 3M bond sold for $1,051.20 in March 2021.

This makes logical sense when one considers that an investment in a bond involves\na series of future cash inflows, or payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder over the term of the\nbond’s maturity.\nTo determine the value of a bond today, the two-step time value of money calculation we discussed earlier\nmust be used, and the present value of a series of coupon payments (or an annuity) must be determined. This\npresent value amount will then be added to the present value of a single lump sum payment (the principal or\nface value) that will come to the bondholder at the end of the bond’s term (maturity).\nFixed Income\nBecause standard fixed-rate bonds have their coupon payments and maturity amounts locked in, they are\noften referred to as fixed-income investments. This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\ncompared to stocks.\n1\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n10.2 • Bond Valuation\n291\nWhile yields provided by corporate and government bonds such as US T-bills and municipal bonds are\ncurrently low because the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) has kept interest rates low for several years,\ninvestors may still consider adding bonds to their portfolios.2 This is especially true as investors enter their\nretirement years and seek to generate income while avoiding the volatility of the stock market. Such investors\ncan add a mix of individual bonds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds to their portfolios, thus generating\npotential return while keeping risks at a minimum. Fixed-income investments such as intermediate- or longer-\nterm bond funds are still providing good yields despite the low-interest-rate state of the economy.\nIt is important to note, however, that even though bonds are generally thought of as safer investments, they\nstill are subject to a number of risks. Because income from most bonds is fixed, such instruments can have\ntheir values eroded by external factors such as interest rates and inflation. We will discuss some of these risks\nafter the next section.\nPeriod\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nEnd Date 6/30/20 12/31/20 6/30/21 12/31/21 6/30/22 12/31/22 6/30/23 12/31/23 6/30/24 12/31/24\nCoupon\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\n$4,500\nPrincipal\n$100,000\nTable 10.4\nTable 10.4 shows the cash inflow of a five-year, 9%, $100,000 corporate bond dated January 1, 2020.

The YTM reflects the going rate in\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM?

These are\ndetermining a YTM, calculating a bond’s current price (or value), and determining a bond’s maturity period.\nFirst, let’s work through another example of calculating a YTM, but this time with a bond that has annual\ninterest payments instead of semiannual coupons.\nLet’s say you are considering buying a bond, but you want to calculate the YTM to determine if it will meet\nyour overall return requirements. Some facts you have on the bond are that it has a $1,000 face value and that\nit matures in 12 years. Assume that the current price of the bond is $675 and it pays coupons annually at 3.5%.\nSee Table 10.7 for the steps to calculate the YTM.\nStep\nDescription\nEnter\nDisplay\n1\nClear calculator register\nCE/C\nCE/C\n0.0000\n2\nEnter present value or price as a negative amount\n675 +|-\n+|- PV\nPV PV =\n-675.0000\n3\nEnter future or par value\n1000 FV\nFV\nFV =\n1,000.0000\n4\nEnter periods (12 years)\n12 NN\nN =\n12.0000\n5\nEnter coupon payment\n35 PMT\nPMT\nPMT =\n35.0000\n6\nCompute interest rate\nCPT I/Y\nI/Y\nI/Y =\n7.7589\nTable 10.7 Calculator Steps for Computing Yield to Maturity\nBy following the steps in the table above, you will arrive at a YTM of 7.76%.\nUsing a calculator is fast and accurate for finding bond yields. Thus, if you know the bond’s current price and\nall of the future cash flows, you can find the YTM, or the return rate that the bond buyer is receiving on the\nfunds loaned to the bond issuer. As mentioned, Excel spreadsheets are as easy and accurate as a financial\ncalculator for determining bond rates, and we will cover these later in the chapter.\nDetermining Bond Price or Value Using a Calculator\nLet’s say a friend recommends a 20-year bond that has a face value of $1,000 and a 6% annual coupon rate.

This remains the\nfastest declaration by the committee on record since the founding of the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch (NBER) in 1978.4\nIn July 2021, the committee declared that the economy had reached a trough in April 2020, marking the end\nof the recession of the early 2020s and making it the shortest US recession on record as well as the most\nquickly identified one.5\n(sources: www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/business/yield-curve-recession-indicator.html; www.nber.org/\nnews/business-cycle-dating-committee-announcement-june-8-2020; fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2020/11/are-\nwe-still-in-a-recession/)\nA flat shape for the yield curve occurs when there is not a great deal of difference between short-term and\nlong-term yields (see Figure 10.10).

Due to the relative stability of\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\n•\nLiquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\n•\nDuration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default\n301\n•\nCall risk and reinvestment risk. Call risk is the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing\nfirm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has\na call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by\nissuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has\nthe effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\noriginal bond investors.\n•\nTerm risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\nDefault Risk\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.",

Yet it is important\nto realize that stock has some significant disadvantages, which can include the following:\n•\nGeneral risk levels are greater than with bonds or other fixed-income investments.\n•\nTiming the buy-and-sell transactions of stock can be tricky and may lead to losses or not taking full\nadvantage of share price opportunities.\n•\nDividends (provided that the stock does indeed pay them, as not all do) are uncertain and subject to\nchange based on decisions of company management.\nWe will discuss these topics in this chapter and cover many of the details regarding why corporations issue\ncommon stock and why investors purchase that stock.\n11.1\nMultiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio given company data.\n•\nDetermine relative under- or overvaluation indicated by a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio.\n•\nDefine and calculate a P/B (price-to-book) ratio given company data.\n•\nDetermine relative under- or overvaluation indicated by a P/B (price-to-book) ratio.\n•\nDefine and detail alternative valuation multipliers, including P/S (price-to-sales) ratio, P/CF (price-to-cash-\nflow) ratio, and dividend yield.\nThe Price-to Earnings (P/E) Ratio\nExperienced investors use a number of different methods to evaluate information on companies and their\ncommon stock before deciding on any potential purchase. One of the most popular techniques used by\ninvestors and analysts is to study a company’s financial statements in order to uncover basic fundamental\ninformation on the company. This involves calculating a number of financial ratios that help identify trends,\nbringing elements of operational performance to light and allowing for clearer analysis and evaluation.\nA well-proven analytical approach for investors to use in evaluating common stock is to review the overall\nmarket value of the company that issues a stock. One of the most consistently used calculations in this\nanalysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is the price-to-earnings\n(P/E) ratio.\nThe P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:\n320\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe P/E ratio is extremely useful to analysts in that it shows the expectations of the market. Essentially, the P/E\nratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate\nearnings.\nBottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how\nprofitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line\nremains relatively flat over a period of time, leaving earnings per share (EPS) relatively unchanged, the P/E\nratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.\nFor example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is\n$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as\nThis ratio would typically be expressed in the form\n. Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay\nup to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at\na multiple of six.\nThe P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites\nand often carries the notation P/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and\nsignals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.\nAnother form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections\nrather than actual trailing amounts. The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as",

Because of these\ndiscrepancies in interpretation and overall variance of opinion, the use of alternate stock valuation metrics,\neither in addition to or in place of the P/B ratio, is always worth exploring.\nIn conclusion, the P/B ratio can help a company understand if its net assets are comparable to the market\nprice of its stock. However, as with the P/E ratio, it is always a good idea to compare P/B ratios of companies\nwithin the same industry and use them in conjunction with other metrics and analytical methodologies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPrice-to-Earnings Ratio and Price-to-Book Ratio\nTwo videos cover the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (https://openstax.org/r/price-to-earnings) and the price-\nto-book (P/B) ratio (https://openstax.org/r/price-to-book_ratio). These are excellent introductory videos\nthat will provide you with helpful information on what these ratios represent and how they can be used in\nstock valuation.\n322\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAlternative Multipliers\nThere are two main types of valuation metrics multiples used to value common stock. These are equity\nmultiples and enterprise value (EV) multiples. Additionally, there are two primary methods by which to\nperform analysis using these multiples. These methods are comparable company analysis (comps) and\nprecedent transaction analysis (precedents).\nExperienced financial analysts advocate the use of multiples in valuation analysis for a number of reasons, the\nmost important being that they help generate realistic and sound judgments of enterprise values (total\ncompany values), they are relatively easy to use and interpret, and they can provide helpful information on a\ncompany’s overall financial condition when used appropriately.\nHowever, it should be noted that simplicity may have some important disadvantages. When such complex\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\nlong-term scenarios.\nEquity Multiples\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.\nWhile these various metrics are important, a financial analyst must always consider that companies often\noperate under their own unique sets of circumstances that ultimately will influence many of these equity\nmultiples.\nEnterprise Value (EV) Multiples\nThe following are some common EV multiples used in valuation analyses:\nGordon growth model is as follows\n11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation\n323\nEV multiples take an increasingly important role when value decisions surround recent mergers and\nacquisitions. Enterprise value (EV) is a measurement of the total value of a company. Companies often\nbelieve that EV offers a more accurate representation of a firm’s total value than a basic market capitalization\nmethod. Generally, EV is perceived to offer an aggregate value of the firm as an enterprise, which is a more\ncomprehensive measurement (see Figure 11.2).\nFigure 11.2 Enterprise Value: The Complete Picture\nFollowing are two of the most common enterprise values metrics used in valuing companies and their",

This is also an unrealistic\nassumption that can present problems when attempting to evaluate companies such as Amazon, Facebook,\nGoogle, or other organizations that do not pay dividends. Constant growth models are most often used to\nvalue mature companies whose dividend payments have steadily increased over a significant period of time.\nWhen applied, the constant growth DDM will generate the present value of an infinite stream of dividends that\nare growing at a constant rate.\nThe constant growth DDM formula is\nwhere D0 is the value of the dividend received this year, D1 is the value of the dividend to be received next\nyear, g is the growth rate of the dividend, and r is the required rate of return.\nAs can be seen above, after simplification, the constant growth DDM formula becomes the Gordon growth\nmodel formula and works in the same way. Let’s look at some examples.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 1\nIf a stock is paying a dividend of $5.00 this year and the dividend has been steadily growing at 4% annually,\nwhat is the intrinsic value of the stock, assuming an investor’s required rate of return of 8%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify to the Gordon growth model:\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n327\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nConstant Growth DDM: Example 2\nIf a stock is selling at $250 with a current dividend of $10, what would be the dividend growth rate of this\nstock, assuming a required rate of return of 12%?\nSolution:\nApply the constant growth DDM formula:\nSimplify and continue the calculation:\nSo, the growth rate is 7.69%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDividend Discount Model: A Complete Animated Guide\nIn this video for the Investing for Beginners course and podcast, Andrew Sather introduces the DDM,\n(https://openstax.org/r/Andrew_Sather_introduces_the_DDM) demonstrating both the constant growth\nDDM (Gordon growth model) and the two-stage DDM.\nVariable or Nonconstant Growth Dividend Discount Model\nMany experienced analysts prefer to use the variable (nonconstant) growth DDM because it is a much closer\napproximation of businesses’ actual dividend payment policies, making it much closer to reality than other\nforms of DDM. The variable growth model is based on the real-life assumption that a company and its stock\nvalue will progress through different stages of growth.\nThe variable growth model is estimated by extending the constant growth model to include a separate\ncalculation for each growth period. Determine present values for each of these periods, and then add them all\ntogether to arrive at the intrinsic value of the stock. The variable growth model is more involved than other\nDDM methods, but it is not overly complex and will often provide a more realistic and accurate picture of a\nstock’s true value.\nAs an example of the variable growth model, let’s say that Maddox Inc. paid $2.00 per share in common stock\ndividends last year. The company’s policy is to increase its dividends at a rate of 5% for four years, and then\nthe growth rate will change to 3% per year from the fifth year forward. What is the present value of the stock if\nthe required rate of return is 8%?

Many analysts like to use the\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\n•",

We can use a shortcut to determine\nthe average growth rate by using the first and last dividends in the stream and the time value of money\nequation. We want to find the average growth rate given an initial dividend (present value) of $0.70, the most\nrecent dividend (future value) of $2.11, and the number of years (n) between the two dividends, or the number\nof dividend changes, which is 9.

The first method, calculating the\nchange in dividend each year and then averaging these changes, is the arithmetic approach. The second\nmethod, using the first and last dividends only, is the geometric approach. The arithmetic approach is\nequivalent to a simple interest approach, and the geometric approach is equivalent to a compound interest\napproach.\nTo apply our PV formula above, we had to assume that the company would pay dividends forever and that we\nwould hold on to our stock forever. If we assume that we will sell the stock at some point in the future,\nhowever, can we use this formula to estimate the value of a stock held for a finite period of time? The answer\nis a qualified yes. We can adjust this model for a finite horizon to estimate the present value of the dividend\nstream that we will receive while holding the stock. We will still have a problem estimating the stock’s selling\nprice at the end of this finite dividend stream, and we will address this issue shortly. For the finite growing\ndividend stream, we adjust the infinite stream in our earlier equation to the following:\nwhere n is the number of future dividends.\nThis equation may look very complicated, but just focus on the far right part of the model. This part calculates\nthe percentage of the finite dividend stream that you will receive if you sell the stock at the end of the nth year.\nSay you will sell Johnson & Johnson after 10 years. What percentage of the $60.23 (the finite dividend stream)\nwill you get? Begin with the following:\n338\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNow, multiply the result by the price for your portion of the infinite stream:\nThe next step is to discount the selling price of Johnson & Johnson in 10 years at 17% and then add the two\nvalues to get the stock’s price. So, how do we estimate the stock’s price at the end of 10 years? If we elect to\nsell the stock after 10 years and the company will continue to pay dividends at the same growth rate, what\nwould a buyer be willing to pay? How could we estimate the selling price (value) of the stock at that time?\nWe need to estimate the dividend in 10 years and assume a growth rate and the required return of the new\nowner at that point in time. Let’s assume that the new owner also wants a 17% return and that the dividend\ngrowth rate will remain at 13.04%. We calculate the dividend in 10 years by taking the current growth rate plus\none raised to the tenth power times the current dividend:\nWe then use the dividend growth model with infinite horizon to determine the price in 10 years as follows:\nYour price for the stock today—given that you will receive the growing dividend stream for 10 years and sell\nfor $258.10 in 10 years, and also given that you want a 17% return over the 10 years—is as shown below:\nWhy did you get the same price of $60.23 for your stock with both the infinite growth model and the finite\nmodel? The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.",

The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\nof the stock.\nAlthough this point may be subtle, what we have just shown is that a stock’s price is the present value of its\nfuture dividend stream.

This can make things a bit more complicated. When a future pattern is not an\nannuity or the modified annuity stream of constant growth, there is no shortcut. You have to estimate every\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n339\nfuture dividend and then discount each individual dividend back to the present. All is not lost, however.\nSometimes you can see patterns in the dividends. For example, a firm might shift into a dividend stream\npattern that will allow you to use one of the dividend models to take a shortcut for pricing the stock. Let’s\nlook at an example.\nJM and Company is a small start-up firm that will institute a dividend payment—a $0.25 dividend—for the\nfirst time at the end of this year. The company expects rapid growth over the next four years and will\nincrease its dividend to $0.50, then to $1.50, and then to $3.00 before settling into a constant growth\ndividend pattern with dividends growing at 5% every year (see Table 11.6). If you believe that JM and\nCompany will deliver this dividend pattern and you desire a 13% return on your investment, what price\nshould you pay for this stock?\nT0\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nT5\n$0.25 $0.50 $1.50 $1.275 $3.00\nTable 11.6\nSolution: To price this stock, we will need to discount the first four dividends at 13% and then discount the\nconstant growth portion of the dividends, the first payment of which will be received at the end of year 5.\nLet’s calculate the first four dividends:\nWe now turn to the constant growth dividend pattern, where we can use our infinite horizon constant\ngrowth model as follows:\nThis figure is the price of the constant growth portion at the end of the fourth period, so we still need to\ndiscount it back to the present at the 13% required rate of return:\nSo, the price of this stock with a nonconstant dividend pattern is\nSome Final Thoughts on Dividend Discount Models\nThe dividend used to calculate a price is the expected future payout and expected future dividend growth. This\nmeans the DDM is most useful when valuing companies that have long, consistent dividend records.\nIf the DDM formula is applied to a company with a limited dividend history, or in an industry exposed to\nsignificant risks that could affect a company’s ability to maintain its payout, the resulting derived value may\nnot be entirely accurate.\nIn most cases, dividend models, whether constant growth or constant dividend, appeal to a fundamental\nconcept of asset pricing: the future cash flow to which the owner is entitled while holding the asset and the\nrequired rate of return for that cash flow determine the value of a financial asset. However, problems can arise\nwhen using these models because the timing and amounts of future cash flows may be difficult to predict.\n340\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n11.3\nDiscounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain how the DCF model differs from DDMs.\n•\nApply the DCF model.\n•\nExplain the advantages and disadvantages of the DCF model.\nWhen investors buy stock, they do so in order to receive cash inflows at different points in time in the future.\nThese inflows come in the form of cash dividends (provided the stock does indeed pay dividends, because not\nall do) and also in the form of the final cash inflow that will occur when the investor decides to sell the stock.\nThe investor hopes that the final sale price of the stock will be higher than the purchase price, resulting in a",

However, it should be noted\nthat cash flow is not always the best means of measuring financial health. A company can always sell a large\nportion of its assets to generate a positive cash flow, even if it is operating at a loss or experiencing other\nfinancial difficulties. Additionally, investors prefer to see companies reinvesting their cash back into their\nbusinesses rather than sitting on excessive balances of idle cash.\nSimilar to other models, the discounted cash flow model is only as good as the information entered. As the\ncommon expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” This can often be the case if reasonably accurate cash\nflow estimates are not available or if an unrealistic discount rate or required rate of return is used in the\ncalculations. It is always best to use several different methods when valuing companies and their common\nstock.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nPlease view this short video on discounted cash flow (https://openstax.org/r/short_video_on_discounted)\nand how this method can be applied in stock valuation.\n11.4\nPreferred Stock\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine preferred stock.\n•\nCalculate the intrinsic value of preferred stock.\n•\nUnderstand the difference between common stock and preferred stock.\nFeatures of Preferred Stock\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\nPreferred stock will often feature a dividend that a company is obligated to pay out before it makes any\ndividend payments to common stockholders. In cases of bankruptcy and liquidation of the issuing company,\npreferred stockholders have priority claim to assets before common stockholders. Additionally, preferred\nstockholders are usually entitled to a set (or constant) dividend every period.\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, they have no maturity date, and consequently,\nthere is no final payment of the par value. The only time a company would pay this par value to the\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\n11.4 • Preferred Stock\n343\nFor example, a company may convert preferred stock into common stock at a preset point in the future.

Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock. Because shares of preferred stock provide a constant\ncash dividend based on original par value and the stated dividend rate, these may be considered a form of\nperpetuity.\nIt is this constant, preferred dividend stream that makes preferred stock seem more like bonds or another\nform of debt than like stock. In addition, the constant dividend stream leads nicely to the pricing of preferred\nstock with the four dividend models we presented earlier in this chapter.\nDetermining the Intrinsic Value of Preferred Stock\nWe can apply a version of the present value of a perpetuity formula to value preferred stock, as in the\nfollowing example. Oh-Well Heath Services Inc. has issued preferred stock that has a par value of $1,000 and\npays an annual dividend rate of 5%. If the market considers the risk of Oh-Well to warrant a 10% discount rate,\nwhat would be a fair market price for Oh-Well preferred stock?\nFirst, we find the dividend value of Oh-Well:\nWe then use the constant dividend model with infinite horizon because we have g equal to zero and n equal to\ninfinity:\nWe can also rearrange the formula to determine the required return on this stock, given its annual dividend\nand current price.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating the Return on Preferred Stock\nData Forge Inc. has just issued preferred stock (cumulative) with a par value of $100.00 and an annual\ndividend rate of 7%. The preferred stock is currently selling for $35.00 per share. What is the yield or return\non this preferred stock?\nSolution:\nThe first step is to determine the annual dividend by multiplying the dividend rate by the par value:\nNow, using this $7.00 annual dividend, the $35.00 current price, and the equation above, we calculate the\nrate of return as follows:\n344\n11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nWe have introduced the concept of return here, which should be thought of as both the anticipated return for\nthe preferred stockholder and the company’s cost of borrowing money for this particular type of capital.\nDifferences between Preferred and Common Stock\nAs we have discussed, preferred stock has important differences from common stock that apply to issuing\nfirms and to investors.

T-bonds are like T-notes in\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\nborrowing we have discussed.3\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds. GO bonds\ngenerate cash flows to repay the bonds by taxing a project. For instance, a local school district may tax\nresidents to pay for capital construction, or a city may tax citizens to pay for a new public works building.\nRevenue bonds, on the other hand, may apply to projects that generate sufficient cash flows to repay the\nbond—perhaps a utility or local toll road.\nCorporate Bond Markets\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often\nuses bank loans, commercial paper, or supplier credit for short-term borrowing needs and issues bonds for\nlonger-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the\norder, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required\nactivities lapse.

Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for\ntrading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\nWhen a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a\nmortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a\ndebenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of\na specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.\nThe risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market\nconditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash\nflows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have\nfound that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,\nin today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance.

In fact, T-bonds often\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\n366\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.8 Treasury Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nInflation slowed from 2000 to 2020, and the average annual rate of return on T-bonds fell accordingly (see\nFigure 12.9). With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\nRecession.\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\nFigure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average\nannual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period\nfrom 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual\npremium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.\nThese premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor\nplaced $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end\n2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506\non a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (see Figure 12.12).\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\n367\nFigure 12.9 Treasury Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.10 Baa Bond Performance, 1980–1999 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nFigure 12.11 Baa Bond Performance, 2000–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\n368\n12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 12.12 Baa Bonds versus T-Bonds Performance, 1980–2020 (data source: Aswath Damodaran Online)\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nProfile of Bill Gross\nBill Gross may be the most successful fixed-income investor ever, but he is also a prime example of the\napplication of the efficient market theory.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\npinball machines in barbershops.\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\n373\nof financial statements and intrinsic value to examine the character of executive management. He applied\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\nthan the windshield.”\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If",

Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\nThe notation\nis used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\ntaken from a sample. The notation\nis used to denote the sum of the data values, and\nis used to indicate\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value.

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\nvalues of the outliers.\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression\n. The variable n represents the\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate\n, which is\n, or 3. This\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\nexample illustrates this point.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nFinding the Measure of Center\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\nSolution:\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\n$5,000,000.\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\nset.\n13.1 • Measures of Center\n383\nMode\nAnother measure of center is the mode. The mode is the most frequent value. There can be more than one\nmode in a data set as long as those values have the same frequency and that frequency is the highest. A data\nset with two modes is called bimodal. For example, assume that the weekly closing stock price for a technology\nstock, in dollars, is recorded for 20 consecutive weeks as follows:\nTo find the mode, determine the most frequent score, which is 72. It occurs five times. Thus, the mode of this\ndata set is 72.

They are\nall, in their own way, trying to measure the common point within the data—that which is “normal.” In the case\nof the arithmetic mean, this is accomplished by finding the value from which all points are equal linear\ndistances. We can imagine that all the data values are combined through addition and then distributed back to\neach data point in equal amounts.\nThe geometric mean redistributes not the sum of the values but their product. It is calculated by multiplying\nall the individual values and then redistributing them in equal portions such that the total product remains the\nsame. This can be seen from the formula for the geometric mean, x̃ (pronounced x-tilde):\nThe geometric mean is relevant in economics and finance for dealing with growth—of markets, in investments,\nand so on. For an example of a finance application, assume we would like to know the equivalent percentage\ngrowth rate over a five-year period, given the yearly growth rates for the investment.\nFor a five-year period, the annual rate of return for a certificate of deposit (CD) investment is as follows:\n3.21%, 2.79%, 1.88%, 1.42%, 1.17%. Find the single percentage growth rate that is equivalent to these five\nannual consecutive rates of return. The geometric mean of these five rates of return will provide the solution.\nTo calculate the geometric mean for these values (which must all be positive), first multiply1 the rates of return\ntogether—after adding 1 to the decimal equivalent of each interest rate—and then take the nth root of the\nproduct. We are interested in calculating the equivalent overall rate of return for the yearly rates of return,\nwhich can be expressed as 1.0321, 1.0279, 1.0188, 1.0142, and 1.0117:\nBased on the geometric mean, the equivalent annual rate of return for this time period is 2.09%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nArithmetic versus Geometric Means\nIn this video on arithmetic versus geometric means (https://openstax.org/r/arithmetic-versus-geometric),\nthe returns of the S&P 500 are tracked using an arithmetic mean versus a geometric mean, and the\ndifference between these two measurements is discussed.\nWeighted Mean\nA weighted mean is a measure of the center, or average, of a data set where each data value is assigned a\ncorresponding weight. A common financial application of a weighted mean is in determining the average price\n1\nIn this chapter, the interpunct dot will be used to indicate the multiplication operation in formulas.\n384\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nper share for a certain stock when the stock has been purchased at different points in time and at different\nshare prices.\nTo calculate a weighted mean, create a table with the data values in one column and the weights in a second\ncolumn.

The normal distribution is applicable when the frequency of data values decreases with each\nclass above and below the mean. The normal distribution can be applied to many examples from the finance\nindustry, including average returns for mutual funds over a certain time period, portfolio values, and others.\nThe normal distribution has two parameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the\nstandard deviation,\n. The variable x represents the quantity being measured whose data values have a\n394\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nnormal distribution.\nFigure 13.3 Graph of the Normal Distribution\nThe curve in Figure 13.3 is symmetric about a vertical line drawn through the mean,\n. The mean is the same\nas the median, which is the same as the mode, because the graph is symmetric about\n. As the notation\nindicates, the normal distribution depends only on the mean and the standard deviation. Because the area\nunder the curve must equal 1, a change in the standard deviation,\n, causes a change in the shape of the\nnormal curve; the curve becomes fatter and wider or skinnier and taller depending on\n. A change in\ncauses\nthe graph to shift to the left or right. This means there are an infinite number of normal probability\ndistributions.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the normal distribution, we find specific areas under the normal\ncurve, and this is further discussed in Apply the Normal Distribution in Financial Contexts. For example,\nsuppose that at a financial consulting company, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with a standard\ndeviation of $7,500. A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\nof the data value $75,000.\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\na standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\nResult: 0.25249\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\nExponential Distribution\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For\nexample, a finance professional might want to model the time to default on payments for company debt\nholders.\nAn exponential distribution is one in which there are fewer large values and more small values. For example,\nmarketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in a store follows an exponential\ndistribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large\namounts of money.\nExponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a\nproduct lasts. The random variable for the exponential distribution is continuous and often measures a\n13.4 • Statistical Distributions\n395\npassage of time, although it can be used in other applications. Typical questions may be, What is the\nprobability that some event will occur between x1 hours and x2 hours? or What is the probability that the event\nwill take more than x1 hours to perform? In these examples, the random variable x equals either the time\nbetween events or the passage of time to complete an action (e.g., wait on a customer). The probability\ndensity function is given by\nwhere\nis the historical average of the values of the random variable (e.g., the historical average waiting\ntime). This probability density function has a mean and standard deviation of\n.\nTo determine probabilities associated with the exponential distribution, we find specific areas under the",

An example of paired data would be if data were collected on employees’ years of experience and\ntheir corresponding salaries. Typically, it is of interest to investigate possible associations or correlations\nbetween the two variables under analysis.\nTime Series Graphs\nSuppose that we want to track the consumer price index (CPI) over the past 10 years. One feature of the data\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph\nfor the (rounded) annual CPI data (see Table 13.12). The time series graph is shown in Figure 13.7.\nYear\nCPI\n2012 226.65\n2013 230.28\n2014 233.91\nTable 13.12\nData for Time\nSeries Graph\nof Annual CPI,\n2012–2021\n(source: US\nBureau of\nLabor\nStatistics)\n13.6 • Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\n403\nYear\nCPI\n2015 233.70\n2016 236.91\n2017 242.84\n2018 247.87\n2019 251.71\n2020 257.97\n2021 261.58\nTable 13.12\nData for Time\nSeries Graph\nof Annual CPI,\n2012–2021\n(source: US\nBureau of\nLabor\nStatistics)\nFigure 13.7 Time Series Graph of Annual CPI, 2012–2021\nScatter Plots\nA scatter plot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two\nvariables. The setup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other\nvariable is plotted on the vertical axis. Then each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the\nvarious points are plotted on the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns\nor trends. Additional statistical analysis can be conducted to determine if there is a correlation or other\nstatistically significant relationship between the two variables.\nAssume we are interested in tracking the closing price of Nike stock over the one-year time period from April\n2020 to March 2021. We would also like to know if there is a correlation or relationship between the price of\nNike stock and the value of the S&P 500 over the same time period. To visualize this relationship, we can create\na scatter plot based on the (x, y) data shown in Table 13.13.

It is available as a free program and\nprovides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis, graphing, and statistical programming. R is\nincreasingly being used as a data analysis and statistical tool as it is an open-source language and additional\nfeatures are constantly being added by the user community. The tool can be used on many different\ncomputing platforms and can be downloaded at the R Project website (https://openstax.org/r/the-R-project-\nwebsite).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the R Statistical Tool\nThere are many resources for learning and using the R statistical tool, including the following:\nHow to install R on different computer operating systems (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-install)\nIntroduction to using R (https://openstax.org/r/introduction-to-using-R)\nHow to import and export data using R (https://openstax.org/r/how-to-import-and-export)\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) on using R (https://openstax.org/r/frequently-asked-questions)\nOnce you have installed and started R on your computer, at the bottom of the R console, you should see the\nsymbol >, which indicates that R is ready to accept commands.\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or 'help.start()' for an HTML\nbrowser interface to help. Type 'q()' to quit R.\n>\nR is a command-driven language, meaning that the user enters commands at the prompt, which R then\nexecutes one at a time. R can also execute a program containing multiple commands. There are ways to add a\ngraphic user interface (GUI) to R. An example of a GUI tool for R is RStudio (https://openstax.org/r/RStudio).\nThe R command line can be used to perform any numeric calculation, similar to a handheld calculator. For\n406\n13 • Statistical Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nexample, to evaluate the expression\nenter the following expression at the command line prompt\nand hit return:\n> 10+3*7\n[1] 31\nMost calculations in R are handled via functions. For statistical analysis, there are many preestablished\nfunctions in R to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and so on. Variables can be named and\nassigned values using the assignment operator <-. For example, the following R commands assign the value of\n20 to the variable named x and assign the value of 30 to the variable named y:\n> x <- 20\n> y <- 30\nThese variable names can be used in any calculation, such as multiplying x by y to produce the result 600:\n> x*y\n[1] 600\nThe typical method for using functions in statistical applications is to first create a vector of data values. There\nare several ways to create vectors in R. For example, the c function is often used to combine values into a\nvector. The following R command will generate a vector called salaries that contains the data values 40,000,\n50,000, 75,000, and 92,000:\n> salaries <- c(40000, 50000, 75000, 92000)\nThis vector salaries can then be used in statistical functions such as mean, median, min, max, and so on, as\nshown:\n> mean(salaries)\n[1] 64250\n> median(salaries)\n[1] 62500\n> min(salaries)\n[1] 40000\n> max(salaries)\n[1] 92000\n13.7 • The R Statistical Analysis Tool\n407\nAnother option for generating a vector in R is to use the seq function, which will automatically generate a\nsequence of numbers. For example, we can generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, incremented by 0.5,\nand call this vector example1, as follows:\n> example1 <- seq(1, 5, by=0.5)\nIf we then type the name of the vector and hit enter, R will provide a listing of numeric values for that vector\nname.\n> salaries\n[1] 40000 50000 75000 92000\n> example1\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\nOften, we are interested in generating a quick statistical summary of a data set in the form of its mean,",

Assume we have the data shown in Table 13.13, collected over a one-year time\nperiod.\nNote that data can be read into R from a text file or Excel file or from the clipboard by using various R\ncommands. Assume the values of the S&P 500 have been loaded into the vector SP500 and the values of Nike\nstock prices have been loaded into the vector Nike. Then, to generate the scatter plot, we can use the following\nR command:\n>plot(SP500, Nike, main=\"Scatter Plot of Nike Stock Price vs. S&P 500\", xlab=\"S&P\n500\", ylab=\"Nike Stock Price\")\nAs a result of these commands, R provides the scatter plot shown in Figure 13.10.

The\nterms mean and average are often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the\nnumbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes\nnot the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing\nthem in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of\nnumbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.\n13.2 Measures of Spread\nThe standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small\nwhen the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard\ndeviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The\nformula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a\npopulation, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are\nslightly different.\n13.3 Measures of Position\nSeveral measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two\nparameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean,\n, and the standard deviation,\n. The exponential\ndistribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.\n13.5 Probability Distributions\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many\nfinancial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that\nfollow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal\ncurve.\n13.6 Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\nData visualization refers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns\nand trends in the data. Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,\nsuch as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\nseveral types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the\ndata and the purpose of the graph. Examples of graphs for univariate data include line graphs, bar graphs,\nand histograms. Bivariate data refers to paired data where each value of one variable is paired with a value of\na second variable. Examples of graphs for bivariate data include time series graphs and scatter plots.\n13 • Summary\n411\n13.7 The R Statistical Analysis Tool\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry.

We must remember that correlation\ndoes not imply causation.\nTest a Correlation Coefficient for Significance\nThe correlation coefficient, r, tells us about the strength and direction of the linear relationship between x and\ny. The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the\nentire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,\nwhich is labeled as the Greek letter ρ (pronounced “rho”). But because we have only sample data, we cannot\ncalculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the\nunknown population correlation coefficient.\n•\nρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)\n•\nr = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)\nAn important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are\nasking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions for y based on values of x. One\nmethod to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us\ndecide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is close to zero or significantly different\nfrom zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.\nIf the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the\ncorrelation coefficient is significant.\n•\nConclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x\nand y variables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\n•\nWhat the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between the x and y variables. If the\ntest concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we\nsay that the correlation coefficient is not significant.\nA hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical\nmethod that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the\nhypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficient ρ is equal to zero.\nUse these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:\n•\nNull hypothesis:\n•\nAlternate hypothesis:\nThe hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:\n•\nNull hypothesis\n: The population correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero. There is\nnot a significant linear relationship (correlation) between x and y in the population.\n422\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nAlternate hypothesis\n: The population correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero. There\nis a significant linear relationship (correlation) between x and y in the population.\nA quick shorthand way to test correlations is the relationship between the sample size and the correlation. If\nthen this implies that the correlation between the two variables demonstrates that a linear\nrelationship exists and is statistically significant at approximately the 0.05 level of significance. As the formula\nindicates, there is an inverse relationship between the sample size and the required correlation for significance\nof a linear relationship. With only 10 observations, the required correlation for significance is 0.6325; for 30\nobservations, the required correlation for significance decreases to 0.3651; and at 100 observations, the\nrequired level is only 0.2000.\nNOTE:\n•\nIf r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line can be used to predict the value of y for\nvalues of x that are within the domain of observed x-values.\n•\nIf r is not significant OR if the scatter plot does not show a linear trend, the line should not be used for\nprediction.\n•\nIf r is significant and the scatter plot shows a linear trend, the line may not be appropriate or reliable for\nprediction outside the domain of observed x-values in the data.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nDetermining If a Correlation Is Significant\nSuppose that the chief financial officer (CFO) of a corporation is investigating the correlation between stock",

To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute the\nvalue of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\nvariable (y).\nIn a previous example, the linear regression equation was generated to relate the amount of monthly revenue\nfor a Fortune 500 company to the amount of monthly advertising spend. From the previous example, it was\ndetermined that the regression equation can be written as\nwhere x represents the amount spent on advertising (in thousands of dollars) and y represents the amount of\n434\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nrevenue (in thousands of dollars).\nLet’s assume the Fortune 500 company would like to predict the monthly revenue for a month where it plans\nto spend $80,000 for advertising. To determine the estimate of monthly revenue, let\nin the regression\nequation and calculate a corresponding value for ŷ:\nThis predicted value of y indicates that the forecasted revenue would be $14,320,700, assuming an advertising\nspend of $80,000.\n•\nExcel can provide this forecasted value directly using the =FORECAST command.\n•\nTo use this command, enter the value of the independent variable x, followed by the cell range for the\ny-data and the cell range for the x-data, as follows: =FORECAST(X_VALUE, Range of Y-DATA, Range\nof X-DATA)\n•\nUsing this Excel command, the forecasted value for the revenue is $14,320.52 when the advertising spend\nis $80 (in thousands of dollars) (see Figure 14.9). (Note: The discrepancy in the more precise Excel result\nand the formula result is due to rounding in interim calculations.)\nFigure 14.9 Revenue versus Advertising for Fortune 500 Company ($000s) Showing FORECAST Command in Excel\nA word of caution when predicting values for y: it is generally recommended to only predict values for y using\nvalues of x that are in the original range of the data collection.\nAs an example, assume we have developed a linear model to predict the height of male children based on\ntheir age. We have collected data for the age range from\nyears old to\nyears old, and we have\nconfirmed that the scatter plot shows a linear trend and that the correlation is significant.\nIt would be erroneous to use this model to predict the height of a 25-year-old male since\nis outside the\nrange of the x-data, which was from 3 to 10 years old. The reason this is not recommended is that a linear\npattern cannot be assumed to continue beyond the x-value of 10 years old unless some data collection has\noccurred at ages greater than 10 to confirm that the linear pattern is consistent for x-values beyond 10 years\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n435\nold.\nGenerating Prediction Intervals\nOne important value of an estimated regression equation is its ability to predict the effects on y of a change in\none or more values of the independent variables.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\nvalue of x.\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\nis called the prediction interval.\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for\ncan be calculated as\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and\nis\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the\nconfidence level.\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue. (The commands refer to the Excel\ndata table shown in Figure 14.9.)\n436\n14 • Regression Analysis in Finance\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 14.10 Calculations for 95% Prediction Interval for Monthly Revenue\nThis prediction interval can be interpreted as follows: there is 95% confidence that when the amount spent on\nmonthly advertising is $80,000, the corresponding monthly revenue will be between $13,270.95 and\n$15,370.09.\nVarious computer regression software packages provide programs within the regression functions to provide\nanswers to inquiries of estimated predicted values of y given various values chosen for the x-variable(s). For\nexample, the statistical program R provides these prediction intervals directly. It is important to know just\nwhich interval is being tested in the computer package because the difference in the size of the standard\ndeviations will change the size of the interval estimated. This is shown in Figure 14.11.\nFigure 14.11 Prediction and Confidence Intervals for Regression Equation at 95% Confidence Level\nFigure 14.11 shows visually the difference the standard deviation makes in the size of the estimated intervals.\nThe confidence interval, measuring the expected value of the dependent variable, is smaller than the\nprediction interval for the same level of confidence. The expected value method assumes that the experiment\nis conducted multiple times rather than just once, as in the other method. The logic here is similar, although\nnot identical, to that discussed when developing the relationship between the sample size and the confidence\ninterval using the central limit theorem. There, as the number of experiments increased, the distribution\n14.5 • Predictions and Prediction Intervals\n437\nnarrowed, and the confidence interval became tighter around the expected value of the mean.\nIt is also important to note that the intervals around a point estimate are highly dependent upon the range of\ndata used to estimate the equation, regardless of which approach is being used for prediction. Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation.

Remember that\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\nall independent variables in the equation. As the value of x gets further and further from the (x, y) point\ncorresponding to the mean value of x and the mean value of y, the width of the estimated interval around the\npoint estimate increases. Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation\nposes an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error.

As the value chosen to predict y,\nin the graph, is further from the central\nweight of the data,\n, we see the interval expand in width even while holding constant the level of confidence.\nThis shows that the precision of any estimate will diminish as one tries to predict beyond the largest weight of\nthe data and most certainly will degrade rapidly for predictions beyond the range of the data.

A geometric average return is calculated using the formula\n452\n15 • How to Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nwhere RN is the return for each year in the time period for which the average is calculated.\nThe calculation of the geometric average return for DAL is shown in the right column of Table 15.2.

Adding\neach of the annual returns and dividing the sum by 10 results in a 22.4% average annual return. This 22.4% is\ncalled the arithmetic average return.\nThe geometric average return will be smaller than the arithmetic average return (unless the returns for all\nyears are identical). This is due to the basic arithmetic of compounding. Think of a very simple example in\nwhich you invest $100 for two years. If you have a positive return of 50% the first year and a negative 50%\nreturn the second year, you will have an arithmetic average return of\n, but you will have a\ngeometric average return of\n. With a 50% positive return the\nfirst year, you ended the year with $150. The second year, you lost 50% of that balance and were left with only\n$75.\nAnother important fact when studying average returns is that the order in which you earn the returns is not\nimportant. Consider what would have occurred if the returns in the two years were reversed, so that you faced\na loss of 50% in the first year of your investment and a gain of 50% in the second year of your investment. With\na −50% return in the first year, you would have ended that year with only $50. Then, if that $50 earned a\npositive 50% return the second year, you would have a $75 balance at the end of the two-year period. A\nnegative return of 50% followed by a positive return of 50% still results in an arithmetic average return of 0%",

They simply\nanswer different questions. The geometric average tells you what you actually earned per year on average,\ncompounded annually. It is useful for calculating how much a particular investment grows over a period of\ntime. The arithmetic average tells you what you earned in a typical year. When we are looking at the historical\ndescription of the distribution of returns and want to predict what to expect in a particular year, the arithmetic\naverage is the relevant calculation.\nMeasuring Risk\nAlthough the arithmetic average return for Delta Airlines (DAL) for 2011–2020 was 22.4%, there is not a year in\nwhich the return was exactly 22.4%. In fact, in some years, the return was much higher than the average, such\nas in 2013, when it was 132.61%. In other years, the return was negative, such as 2011, when it was −35.79%.\nLooking at the yearly returns in Table 15.2, the return for DAL varies widely from year to year. In finance, this\nvolatility of returns is considered risk.\nVolatility of Returns\nThe most commonly used measure of volatility of returns in finance is the standard deviation of the returns.\nThe standard deviation of returns for DAL for the sample period 2011–2020 is 51.9%. Remember that if the\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL. Although we can\ncalculate an average return, the return in any particular year is likely to vary from that average. The larger the\nstandard deviation, the greater this range of returns is. Thus, a larger standard deviation indicates a greater\nvolatility of returns and, hence, more risk.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating the Standard Deviation of Returns\nYou calculated the arithmetic average return for CVS to be 11.11% for the 10-year period of 2011–2020.\nCalculate the standard deviation of returns for CVS for the same period (see Table 15.5).

With an\narithmetic average return of 11.11%, the return would lie between −10.45% and 32.67% in about two out of\nthree years. Even though the average return is 11.11%, a return in a particular year might be much higher\nor much lower than that average. In fact, a loss of more than 10.45% would be expected about once every\nsix years. Also, about once every six years, a return greater than 32.67% would be expected.\nFirm-Specific Risk\nInvestors purchase a share of stock hoping that the stock will increase in value and they will receive a positive\nreturn. You can see, however, that even with well-established companies such as ExxonMobil and CVS, returns\nare highly volatile. Investors can never perfectly predict what the return on a stock will be, or even if it will be\npositive.\nThe yearly returns for four companies—Delta Airlines (DAL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), ExxonMobil (XOM), and\nCVS Health Corp.

In this graph, it is easy to see\nthat DAL and LUV both have more volatility, or returns that vary more from year to year, than do XOM or CVS.\nThis higher volatility leads to DAL and LUV having higher standard deviations of returns than XOM or CVS.\nFigure 15.2 Yearly Returns for DAL, LUV, XOM, and CVS (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\nStandard deviation is considered a measure of the risk of owning a stock. The larger the standard deviation of\na stock’s annual returns, the further from the average that stock’s return is likely to be in any given year. In\nother words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable. Although the return for CVS varies from year to\nyear, it is not subject to the wide swings of the returns for DAL or LUV.\nWhy are stock returns so volatile? The value of the stock of a company changes as the expectations of the\nfuture revenues and expenses of the company change. These expectations may change due to a number of\nevents and new information. Good news about a company will tend to result in an increase in the stock price.\nFor example, DAL announcing that it will be opening new routes and flying to cities it has not previously\nserviced suggests that DAL will have more customers and more revenue in future years. Or if CVS announces\nthat it has negotiated lower rent for many of its locations, investors will expect the expenses of the company to\nfall, leading to more profits. Those types of announcements will often be associated with a higher stock price.\nConversely, if the pilots and flight attendants for DAL negotiate higher salaries, the expenses for DAL will\nincrease, putting downward pressure on profits and the stock price.\n15.1 • Risk and Return to an Individual Asset\n457\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPeloton and Risk\nAn example of how news can impact the price of a stock occurred on May 5, 2021, when Peloton recalled all\nof its Tread+ and Tread products after the tragic death of a child and 70 injuries associated with use of its\nproducts.1 The previous day, Peloton stock traded for $96.70 per share.

Finance)\nAs investors diversify their portfolios, the volatility of one particular stock becomes less important. XOM has\ngood years with above-average returns and bad years with below-average (and even negative) returns, just\nlike DAL. But the years in which those above-average and below-average returns occur are not always the\nsame for the two companies. In 2014, for example, the return for DAL was greater than 80%, while the return\nfor XOM was negative. On the other hand, in 2011, when DAL had a return of −35.15%, XOM had a positive\nreturn. When more than one stock is held, the gains in one stock can offset the losses in another stock,\nwashing away some of the volatility.\nWhen an investor holds only one stock, that one stock’s volatility contributes 100% to the portfolio’s volatility.\nWhen two stocks are held, the volatility of each stock contributes to the volatility of the portfolio. However, the\nvolatility of the portfolio is not simply the average of the volatility of each stock held independently. How\ncorrelated the two stocks are, or how much they move together, will impact the volatility of the portfolio.\nYou will recall from our study of correlation in Regression Analysis in Finance that a correlation coefficient\ndescribes how two variables move relative to each other. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that there is a\nperfect, positive correlation between the two variables, while a correlation coefficient of −1 means that the two\nvariables move exactly opposite of each other. Stocks that are in the same industry will tend to be more\n15.2 • Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\n459\nstrongly correlated than stocks that are in much different industries. During the 2011–2020 time period, the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and LUV was 0.87, the correlation coefficient for DAL and XOM was 0.35, and the\ncorrelation coefficient for DAL and CVS was 0.79. Combining stocks that are not perfectly positively correlated\nin a portfolio decreases risk.\nNotice that investors who owned DAL and LUV from 2011 to 2020 would have had a lower portfolio standard\ndeviation, but not much lower, than investors who just owned DAL. Because the correlation coefficient is less\nthan one, the standard deviation fell. However, because the two stocks are in the same industry and exposed\nto many of the same economic issues, the correlation coefficient is relatively high, and combining those two\nstocks provides only a small decrease in risk.\nThis is because, as airlines, DAL and LUV face many of the same market conditions. In years when the economy\nis strong, the weather is good, fuel prices are low, and people are traveling a lot, both companies will do well.\nWhen something such as bad weather conditions reduces the amount of air travel for several weeks, both\ncompanies are harmed. By holding LUV in addition to DAL, investors can reduce exposure to risk that is\nspecific to DAL (perhaps a problem that DAL has with its reservation system), but they do not reduce exposure\nto the risk associated with the airline industry (perhaps rising jet fuel prices). DAL and LUV tend to experience\npositive returns in the same years and negative returns in the same years.\nOn the other hand, investors who added XOM to their portfolio saw a significantly lower standard deviation\nthan those who held just DAL. In years when jet fuel prices rise, harming the profits of both DAL and LUV, XOM\nis likely to see high profits. Diversifying a portfolio across firms that are less correlated will reduce the\nstandard deviation of the portfolio more.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHow to Build a Diversified Portfolio\nTV personality, former hedge fund manager, and author Jim Cramer encourages investors to build a\ndiversified portfolio, having no more than 20% of a portfolio in one sector.3 Watch this CNBC video\n(https://openstax.org/r/CNBC_video) to learn more about how he suggests investors can build a diversified\nportfolio by purchasing five to 10 stocks.\nPortfolio Size and Risk\nAs you add more stocks to a portfolio, the volatility, or standard deviation, of the portfolio decreases. The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important.

The\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\nmarket portfolio.\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically. There are\nalso events that broadly impact the stock market. Changes in the Federal Reserve Bank’s monetary policy and\n3\nAbigail Stevenson. “Jim Cramer Shares His #1 Rule for Investing.” Make It.

Geopolitical events, major storms, and pandemics can also impact the\nentire market. Investors in stocks cannot avoid this type of risk. This unavoidable risk is the systematic risk that\ninvestors in stocks have. This systematic risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.\nIn addition, as per research conducted by Meir Statman,4 the standard deviation of a portfolio drops quickly as\nthe number of stocks in the portfolio increases from one to two or three (see Figure 2 illustration in this\nsubsequent article by Statman (https://openstax.org/r/subsequent_Statman) for context). Increasing the size\nof the portfolio decreases the standard deviation, and thus the risk, of the portfolio. However, as the portfolio\nincreases in size, the amount of risk reduced by adding one more stock to the portfolio will decrease. How\nmany stocks does an investor need for a portfolio to be well-diversified? There is not an exact number that all\nfinancial managers agree on. A portfolio of 15 highly correlated stocks will offer less benefits of diversification\nthan a portfolio of 10 stocks with lower correlation coefficients. A portfolio that consists of American Airlines,\nSpirit Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Jet Blue, along with a few other stocks, is\nnot very diversified because of the heavy concentration in the airline industry. The term diversified portfolio is\na relative concept, but the average investor can create a reasonably diversified portfolio with approximately a\ndozen stocks.\n15.3\nThe Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine risk premium.\n•\nExplain the concept of beta.\n•\nCompute the required return of a security using the CAPM.\nRisk-Free Rate\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a financial theory based on the idea that investors who are willing\nto hold stocks that have higher systematic risk should be rewarded more for taking on this market risk. The\nCAPM focuses on systematic risk, rather than a stock’s individual risk, because firm-specific risk can be\neliminated through diversification.\nSuppose that your grandparents have given you a gift of $20,000.

At the same time, you would like to invest the money and have it grow until\nyou are ready to start law school.\nAlthough you would like to earn a return on the money so that you have more than $20,000 by the time you\nstart law school, your primary objective is to keep the money safe.

It is used as\nan investing benchmark. The average rate of return for the three-month US Treasury security from 1928 to\n2020 is 3.36%.5 You can see that you will not become immensely wealthy by investing in US Treasury bills.\nAnother characteristic of US Treasury securities, however, is that their volatility tends to be much lower than\nthat of stocks. In fact, the standard deviation of returns for the US Treasury bills is 3.0%. Unlike the returns for\nstocks, the return on US Treasury bills has never been negative. The lowest annual return was 0.03%, which\noccurred in 2014.6\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUS Treasury Securities\nVisit the website of the US Department of the Treasury (https://openstax.org/r/home.treasury) to learn\nmore about US Treasury securities. You will find current interest rates for both short-term securities (US\nTreasury bills) and long-term securities (US Treasury bonds).\nRisk Premium\nYou know that if you use your $20,000 to invest in stock rather than in US Treasury bills, the outcome of the\ninvestment will be uncertain. Your investments may do well, but there is also a risk of losing money. You will\nonly be willing to take on this risk if you are rewarded for doing so. In other words, you will only be willing to\ntake the risk of investing in stocks if you think that doing so will make you more than you would make\ninvesting in US Treasury securities.\nFrom 1928 to 2020, the average return for the S&P 500 stock index has been 11.64%, which is much higher\nthan the 3.36% average return for US Treasury bills.7 Stock returns, with a standard deviation of 19.49%,\nhowever, have also been much more volatile. In fact, there were 25 years in which the return for the S&P 500\nindex was negative.\nYou may not be willing to take the risk of losing some of the money your grandparents gave you because you\nhave been setting it aside for law school. If that’s the case, you will want to invest in US Treasury securities.\nYou may have money that you are saving for other long-term goals, such as retirement, with which you are\nwilling to take some risk. The extra return that you will earn for taking on risk is known as the risk premium.\nThe risk premium can be thought of as your reward for being willing to bear risk.\nThe risk premium is calculated as the difference between the return you receive for taking on risk and what\nyou would have returned if you did not take on risk. Using the average return of the S&P 500 (to measure what\ninvestors who bear the risk earn) and the US Treasury bill rate (to measure what investors who do not bear\nrisk earn), the risk premium is calculated as\nBeta\nThe risk premium represents how much an investor who takes on the market portfolio is rewarded for risk.\nInvestors who purchase one stock—DAL, for example—experience volatility, which is measured by the\nstandard deviation of that stock’s returns. Remember that some of that volatility, the volatility caused by firm-\nspecific risk, can be diversified away. Because investors can eliminate firm-specific risk through diversification,\nthey will not be rewarded for that risk. Investors are rewarded for the amount of systematic risk they incur.\n5\n“Historical Return on Stocks, Bonds and Bills: 1928–2020.” Damodaran Online.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\nto be riskier than the average stock.\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\nCalculating Betas\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta. Beta\nmeasures the amount of systematic risk that DAL has.\nFigure 15.3 Calculation of Beta for DAL (data source: Yahoo! Finance)\n15.3 • The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\n463\nCAPM Equation\nBecause DAL’s beta of 1.39 is greater than 1, DAL is riskier than the average stock in the market. Finance\ntheory suggests that investors who purchase DAL will expect a higher rate of return to compensate them for\nthis risk. DAL has 139% of the average stock’s systematic risk; therefore, investors in the stock should receive\n139% of the market risk premium.\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) equation is\nwhere Re is the expected return of the asset, Rf is the risk-free rate of return, and Rm is the expected return of\nthe market. Given the average S&P 500 return of 11.64% and the average US Treasury bill return of 3.36%, the\nexpected return of DAL would be calculated as\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCalculating Beta\nMany providers of stock data and investment information will list a company’s beta. Two internet sources\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCAPM\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\n8\n“Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Suppose that you see an advertisement in which McKinley\nInvestment Management claims that the portfolios of its clients have an average return of 20% per year. You\nknow that this average annual return is meaningless without also knowing something about the riskiness of\nthe firm’s strategy. In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.\nA basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is the Sharpe ratio. The\nSharpe ratio is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s\nreturn, using the formula\nThe portfolio risk premium is the portfolio return RP minus the risk-free return Rf; this is the basic reward for\nbearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on\ntheir portfolios have an excess return of 17%.\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio’s return,\n, is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s\nclients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the\nclients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility\nleads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be\n, or 0.65.\nThus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator\ncan be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for\ntaking on that risk.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSharpe Ratio\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. You can visit Sharpe’s Stanford\nUniversity website (https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe) to find videos in which he discusses financial\ntopics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.\nTreynor Measurement of Performance\nAnother reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is the Treynor ratio. The Treynor ratio\nis calculated as\nJust as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is\nthat the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,\nwhile the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the\n15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement\n465\ndenominator.\nIf McKinley Investment Management has a portfolio with a 20% return over the past five years, with a beta of\n1.2 and a risk-free rate of 3%, the Treynor ratio would be\nBoth the Sharpe and Treynor ratios are relative measures of investment performance, meaning that there is\nnot an absolute number that indicates whether an investment performance is good or bad. An investment\nmanager’s performance must be considered in relation to that of other managers or to a benchmark index.\nJensen’s Alpha\nJensen’s alpha is another common measure of investment performance. It is computed as the raw portfolio\nreturn minus the expected portfolio return predicted by the CAPM:\nSuppose that the average market return has been 12%. What would Jensen’s alpha be for McKinley Investment\nManagement’s portfolio with a 20% average return and a beta of 1.2?\nUnlike the Sharpe and Treynor ratios, which are meaningful in a relative sense, Jensen’s alpha is meaningful in\nan absolute sense. An alpha of 0.062 indicates that the McKinley Investment Management portfolio provided a\nreturn that was 6.2% higher than would be expected given the riskiness of the portfolio. A positive alpha\nindicates that the portfolio had an abnormal return.

After the monthly portfolio return is calculated, then\nthe average monthly portfolio return is calculated in cell F39. The average monthly portfolio return is 2.69%.\nBecause this is an equally weighted portfolio, with each of the four stocks impacting the portfolio return in the\nsame way, the average monthly portfolio return of 2.69% is the same as the sum of the average monthly\nreturns of the four stocks divided by four, or\n.\nThe standard deviation of the monthly portfolio returns is calculated in cell F40. This four-stock portfolio has a\nstandard deviation of 7.10%. Unlike the average return, this standard deviation is not equal to the average of\nthe standard deviations of returns of the four stocks. In fact, the standard deviation for the portfolio is less\nthan the standard deviation for any one of the four stocks. Remember that this occurs because the stock\nreturns are not perfectly positively correlated. The high return of one of the stocks in one month is dampened\nby a lower return in another stock during the same month. Likewise, a negative return in one stock during a\nmonth might be offset by a positive return in one of the other three stocks during the same month. This is the\nrisk reduction benefit of holding a portfolio of stocks.\nCalculating Beta\nThe standard deviation of a stock’s returns indicates the stock’s volatility. Remember that the volatility is\ncaused by both firm-specific and systematic risk. Investors will not be rewarded for firm-specific risk because\n15.5 • Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\n469\nthey can diversify away from it. Investors are, however, rewarded for systematic risk. To determine how much\nof a firm’s risk is due to systematic risk, you can use Excel to calculate the stock’s beta.\nTo calculate a stock’s beta, you need the monthly return for the market in addition to the monthly market\nreturn for the stock. In column B in Figure 15.6, the monthly return for SPY, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, is\nrecorded. SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global\nAdvisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance. The monthly returns for AMZN are\nvisible in column C. It is important that these returns be lined up so that the returns for a particular month for\nboth securities appear in the same row number. Also, you want to place the returns for SPY in the column to\nthe left of the returns for AMZN so that when you create your graph, SPY will automatically appear on the\nhorizontal axis.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nState Street Global Advisors\nYou can learn more about State Street Global Advisors and its creation of the first ETF by visiting the\ncompany’s history page at its website (ssga.com) (https://openstax.org/r/ssga_institutional_our-history).\nYou will use a scatter plot to create a graph.

In addition, solving for MIRR will result in only one solution, unlike the IRR,\nwhich may have multiple mathematical solutions.

Because of this\nlimitation, the MIRR cannot be used to rank projects; it can only be used to make accept-or-reject decisions.\n16.5\nChoosing between Projects\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nChoose between mutually exclusive projects.\n•\nCompare projects with different lives.\n•\nCompare projects of different scales.\n•\nRank projects when resources are limited.\nSo far, we have considered methods for deciding to accept or to reject a single stand-alone project.\nSometimes, managers must make decisions regarding which of two projects to accept, or a company might be\nfaced with a number of good, acceptable projects and have to decide which of those projects to take on during\n490\n16 • How Companies Think about Investing\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthe current year.\nChoosing between Mutually Exclusive Projects\nEarlier in this chapter, we saw that the embroidery machine that Sam’s Sporting Goods was considering had a\npositive NPV, making it a project that Sam’s should accept. However, another, more expensive embroidery\nmachine may be available that is able to make more stitches per minute. Although the initial cost of this heavy-\nduty machine is higher, it would allow Sam’s to embroider and sell more items each year, generating more\nrevenue. The two embroidery machines are mutually exclusive projects. Mutually exclusive projects compete\nwith one another; purchasing one embroidery machine excludes Sam’s from purchasing the other embroidery\nmachine.\nTable 16.11 shows the cash outflow and inflows expected from the original embroidery machine considered as\nwell as the heavy-duty machine. The heavy-duty machine costs $25,000, but it will generate more cash inflows\nin years 3 through 6. Both machines have a positive NPV, leading to decisions to accept the projects. Also, both\nmachines have an IRR exceeding the company’s 9% cost of raising capital, also leading to decisions to accept\nthe projects.\nWhen considered by themselves, each of the machines is a good project for Sam’s to pursue. The question the\nmanagers face is which is the better of the two projects. When faced with this type of decision, the rule is to\ntake the project with the highest NPV. Remember that the goal is to choose projects that add value to the\ncompany.

By ranking\nprojects based on their profitability index, the company is able to determine the best way to allocate its scarce\ncapital for the largest potential increase in NPV.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCapital Budgeting Challenges\nAlthough the basic techniques of project evaluation are straightforward, real-world capital budgeting\ndecisions are complex and multifaceted. The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\nestimate of what it expects.\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\nby the end of April.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReducing Capital Spending\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These companies were cutting their capital\nbudgets by 10% to 80% from their originally planned levels for 2020. Reductions were especially large in the\noil and gas industry, as companies found their revenue projections, and thus the NPV of their planned\nprojects, falling dramatically. In addition, companies found themselves needing to free up cash; with more\nlimited cash resources, fewer positive NPV projects could be accepted and funded.3 Due to the COVID-19\npandemic, many CFOs were challenged to stabilize their corporate cash flows. This article explains how\nquickly reducing capital spending (https://openstax.org/r/quickly-reducing), which is usually a quick\nenough fix, was able to help.\n3\nTom Brinded, Zak Cutler, Erikhans Kok, and Prakash Parbhoo. “Resetting Capital Spending in the Wake of COVID-19.” McKinsey &\nCompany.

It is the time it takes the company to recoup its\ninitial investment. Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\nNPV is negative.\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\n16.4 Alternative Methods\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash\nflows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the\nIRR method; unlike IRR, which may have multiple mathematical solutions, MIRR will result in one solution. The\nprofitability index is calculated as the NPV of the project divided by the initial cost of the project.\n16.5 Choosing between Projects\nFirms may need to choose among a variety of good projects. The projects may have different lives or be\ndifferently sized projects that require different amounts of resources. By choosing projects with the highest\nprofitability index, companies can take on the projects that will lead to the greatest increase in value for the\ncompany.\n16.6 Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions\nExcel spreadsheets provide a way to easily calculate the NPV and IRR of a project. Using Excel to create an NPV\nprofile allows a company to see how much its estimates of the cost of raising funds can err from the true cost\nand have the project still be an acceptable project.\nKey Terms\ncapital budgeting\nthe process a business follows to evaluate potential major projects or investments\ndiscounted payback period\nthe length of time it will take for the present value of the future cash inflows of\na project to equal the initial cost of the investment\nequal annuity approach\na method of comparing projects of different lives by assuming that the projects can\nbe repeated forever\ninternal rate of return (IRR)\nthe discount rate that sets the NPV of a project equal to zero\nmodified internal rate of return (MIRR)\nthe yield that sets the future value of the cash inflows of a project\nequal to the present value of the cash outflows of the project\nmutually exclusive projects\nprojects that compete against each other so that when one project is chosen,\nthe other project cannot be done\nnet present value (NPV)\nthe present value of the cash inflows of a project minus the present value of the\ncash outflows of the project\npayback period\nthe length of time it will take for a company to make enough money from an investment to\nrecover the initial cost of the investment\n16 • Summary\n501\nprofitability index (PI)\nthe present value of cash inflows divided by the present value of cash outflows\nreplacement chain approach\na method of comparing projects of differing lives by repeating shorter\nprojects multiple times until they reach the lifetime of the longest project\nCFA Institute\nThis chapter supports some of the Learning Outcome Statements (LOS) in this CFA® Level I Study Session\n(https://openstax.org/r/cfa-level-i-study-session).

Some obvious\nthings come to mind when you think of how managers would do this. For example, to maximize the value of\nAmerican Airlines, the managers need to attract customers and sell seats on flights. They also need to keep\ncosts as low as possible, which means keeping the costs of purchasing fuel and making plane repairs as low as\npossible. While the concept of keeping costs low is simple, the specific decisions a firm makes can be complex.\nIf American Airlines wants to purchase a new airplane, it needs to consider not just the dollar cost of the initial\npurchase but also the passenger and cargo capacity of the plane as well as ongoing maintenance costs.\nIn addition to paying salaries to its pilots and flight attendants, American Airlines must pay to use investors’\nmoney. If the company wants to purchase a new airplane, it may borrow money to pay for the plane. Even if\nAmerican Airlines does not need to incur debt to buy the plane, the money it uses to buy the plane ultimately\nbelongs to the owners or shareholders of the company. The company must consider the opportunity cost of\nthis money and the return that shareholders are expecting on their investments.\nJust as different planes have distinctive characteristics and costs, the different types of financing that American\nAirlines can use will have different characteristics and costs. One of the tasks of the financial manager is to\nconsider the trade-offs of these sources of funding. In this chapter, we look at the basic principles that\nmanagers use to minimize the cost of funding and maximize the value of the firm.\nHow Firms Raise Capital\n17\n17 • Why It Matters\n507\n17.1\nThe Concept of Capital Structure\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between the two major sources of capital appearing on a balance sheet.\n•\nExplain why there is a cost of capital.\n•\nCalculate the weights in a company’s capital structure.\nThe Basic Balance Sheet\nIn order to produce and sell its products or services, a company needs assets. If a firm will produce shirts, for\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\nbalance sheet.\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\nmust be\n. Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\nAttracting Capital\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\nelsewhere. In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting",

This debt has a coupon\nrate of 6%, paid semiannually, and the bonds mature in 15 years.\nBecause the bonds are selling at a discount, the yield that investors who purchase these bonds will receive if\nthey hold the bond to maturity exceeds 6%.

This YTM should be used in estimating\nthe firm’s overall cost of capital, not the coupon rate of 6% that is stated on the outstanding bonds. The\ncoupon rate on the existing bonds is a historical rate, set under economic conditions that may have been\ndifferent from the current market conditions. The YTM of 6.312% represents what investors are currently\nrequiring to purchase the debt issued by the company.\nAfter-Tax Cost of Debt\nAlthough current debt holders demand to earn 6.312% to encourage them to lend to Bluebonnet Industries,\nthe cost to the firm is less than 6.312%. This is because interest paid on debt is a tax-deductible expense. When\na firm borrows money, the interest it pays is offset to some extent by the tax savings that occur because of this\ndeductible expense.\nThe after-tax cost of debt is the net cost of interest on a company’s debt after taxes.

Finance; MarketWatch)\n514\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example,\nGoodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an\nestimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\nassumptions.\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\nthe numbers will be going forward.\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\nin lower-risk companies.\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.",

Net debt is the\namount of debt that would remain if a company used all of its liquid assets to pay off as much debt as\npossible. Net debt is calculated as the firm’s total debt, both short-term and long-term, minus the firm’s cash\nand cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are current assets that can quickly and easily be converted into cash,\nsuch as Treasury bills, commercial paper, and marketable securities.\nConsider, for example, Apple, which had $112.436 billion in total debt in 2020. The company also had $38.016\nbillion in cash and cash equivalents. This meant that the net debt for Apple was only $74.420 billion. If Apple\nused all of its cash and cash equivalents to pay debt, it would be left with $74.420 billion in debt.2\nCash and cash equivalents can be viewed as negative debt. For firms with relatively low levels of cash, this\nadjustment will not have a large impact on the overall WACC estimate. However, the adjustment can be\nimportant for firms that hold substantial cash reserves.\n17.4\nCapital Structure Choices\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between a levered and an unlevered firm.\n•\nExplain why the choice of capital structure does not impact the value of a firm in perfect financial markets.\n•\nCalculate the interest tax shield.\n•\nExplain how the interest tax shield encourages the use of leverage.\nSo far, we have taken the company’s capital structure as given. Each firm’s capital structure, however, is a\nresult of intentional decisions made by the financial managers of the company.

In addition to\nfans attending the event, it is expected that tourism will increase over the next year as recreational cyclists will\nwant to ride the route of the professional race. You decide to operate a business for one year that will sell T-\nshirts highlighting this event.\nYou will need to make an up-front investment of $40,000 to start the business. You estimate that you will\ngenerate a cash flow of $52,000, after you cover all of your operating costs, at the end of next year. You know\nthat these profits are risky; you think a 10% risk premium is appropriate for the level of riskiness of the\nbusiness. If the risk-free rate is 4%, this means that the appropriate discount rate for you to use is 14%. The\nvalue of this business opportunity is\nThis looks as if it will be a profitable business that should be undertaken.

Although the\ncash flows from the business are uncertain, suppose you are certain that the business will generate at least\n$18,000. (Perhaps you have a guaranteed order from the cycling competition sponsors.) If you borrowed\n$17,000 at the risk-free interest rate of 4%, you would owe\nto the lenders at the\nend of the year. Because you are certain that you will generate at least $18,000 in cash, which is greater than\n$17,680, you can borrow the $17,000 without any risk of defaulting.\nThe $17,000 will not be enough to pay for all the start-up costs. You will also need to raise some capital by\nselling equity. Because your firm will have some debt, or financial leverage, the equity that you raise will be\nknown as levered equity. The equity holders expect the firm to generate $52,000 in cash flows. Debt holders\nmust be paid before equity holders, so this will leave\nfor the shareholders.\nThe expected future cash flows generated by the business are determined by the productivity of its assets, not\nthe manner in which those assets are financed. It is the present value of these expected future cash flows that\ndetermines the firm’s value. Thus, the firm’s value in perfect capital markets will not change as a result of the\ncompany taking on leverage.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMM Proposition I\nNobel laureates Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller wrote influential papers exploring capital structure\nand the cost of a firm’s capital. They began by considering what would occur in a perfectly competitive\nmarket. One of the assumptions of this perfect capital market is that there are no taxes. The idea that the\nmarket value of the unlevered and levered firm is the same in perfect capital markets is known in the field\nof finance as MM Proposition I.\nVisit Milken Institute’s 5-Minute Finance site to explore more about Modigliani and Miller’s contributions\n(https://openstax.org/r/Modigliani) to the understanding of capital structure.\nThe value of your T-shirt business remains at $45,614. You can calculate the value of the levered equity as\nNow, shareholders are willing to pay $28,614 for ownership in this company. They expect to get $34,320 in one\nyear in return for purchasing this equity. What discount rate does this imply?\n17.4 • Capital Structure Choices\n517\nNotice that the expected return to shareholders has risen from 14% for the unlevered firm to 19.94% for the\nlevered firm. Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly\n(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall\nway below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.\nWhen the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would\nreceive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require\nalso increases as leverage is used.\nLeverage and the WACC\nWhat happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\nequity in the capital structure:\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC.

When only equity was used to finance the\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt\nexceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the\ncompany will not be able to pay them. At that point, the cost of debt rises above the risk-free rate. As the\n518\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nweight of debt approaches 100%, the cost of debt capital approaches the cost of equity of the unlevered firm.\nIn other words, if you financed the T-shirt business solely through the use of debt, the debt holders would\nrequire a 14% return because they would be bearing the entire risk of the business and would demand to be\nrewarded for doing so.\nAs the leverage of the firm increases, both the cost of debt capital and the cost of equity capital increase.\nHowever, as the firm’s leverage increases, it is using proportionately more of the relatively cheaper source of\ncapital—debt— and proportionately less of the relatively more expensive source of capital—equity.

Where does the extra $78.40 to pay investors come from? It comes from the\nreduction in taxes that the firm pays due to leverage. If the company uses no debt, it pays $14,560 in taxes. The\nlevered firm pays only $14,481.60 in taxes, a savings of $78.40.\nThe $280 that the levered company pays in interest is shielded from the corporate tax, resulting in tax savings\nof\n.

If the firm has difficulty meeting its\n520\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ndebt obligations, it is said to be in financial distress.\nA firm in financial distress incurs both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs of financial distress include\nfees paid to lawyers, consultants, appraisers, and auctioneers. The indirect costs include loss of customers and\nsuppliers.\nTrade-Off Theory\nTrade-off theory weighs the advantages and disadvantages of using debt in the capital structure. The\nadvantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of\nfinancial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.\nA company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will\nmake it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs. Calculating the precise\nbalance between these two is difficult if not impossible.\nFor companies with a low level of debt, the risk of default is low, and the main impact of an increase in\nleverage will be an increase in the interest tax shield. At some point, however, the tax savings that result from\nincreasing the amount of debt in the capital structure will be just offset by the increased probability of\nincurring the costs of financial distress. For firms that have higher costs of financing distress, this point will be\nreached sooner. Thus, firms that face higher costs of financial distress have a lower optimal level of leverage\nthan firms that face lower costs of financial distress.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nNetflix\nNetflix has experienced phenomenal growth in the past 25 years.

Thus far,\nwe have treated these sources as two broad categories, each with a single cost of capital. In reality, a company\nmay have different types of debt or equity, each with its own cost of capital. The same principle would apply:\nthe WACC of the firm would be calculated using the weights of each of these types multiplied by the cost of\nthat particular type of debt or equity capital.\nPreferred Shares\nAlthough our calculations of WACC thus far have assumed that companies finance their assets only through\ndebt and common equity, we saw at the beginning of the chapter that the basic WACC formula is\nIn addition to common stock, a company can raise equity capital by issuing preferred stock.

It has a promised cash flow to its holders.\nUnlike common equity, the dividend on preferred stock is fixed and known. Also, there are consequences if\nthose preferred dividends are not paid. Common shareholders cannot receive any dividends until preferred\ndividends are paid, and in some cases, preferred shareholders receive voting rights until they are paid the\ndividends that are due. However, preferred shareholders cannot force the company into bankruptcy as debt\nholders can.

Greene pays a corporate tax rate of 21%. Estimate the WACC for\nGreene.\nSolution:\nThe cost of Greene’s common equity financing must be calculated. This can be done using the constant\ndividend growth model:\nThe weights and the costs for each component of capital are placed in the WACC formula:\nThe WACC for Greene Building Company is estimated to be 9.47%. Note that debt financing is the cheapest\ncost of capital for Greene. The reason for this is twofold. First, because debt holders face the least amount\nof risk because they are paid first in the order of claimants, they require a lower return. Second, because\ninterest payments are tax-deductible, the interest tax shield lowers the effective cost of debt to the\n524\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\ncompany. Preferred shareholders will require a higher rate of return than debt holders, 9.17%, because\nthey are later in the order of claimants. Common shareholders are the residual claimants, standing at the\nend of the line to receive payment. After all other claimants are paid, any remaining money belongs to the\nshareholders. If this residual amount is small, the common shareholders receive a small payment. If there is\nnothing left after all other claimants have been paid, common shareholders receive nothing. Thus, common\nshareholders have the greatest amount of risk and require the highest rate of return.\nAlso, note that the weights for debt, preferred stock, and common stock in the capital structure sum to\n100%. The company must finance 100% of its assets.\nIssuing New Common Stock\nAn existing firm can acquire equity capital to expand its assets in two ways: the retention of earnings or the\nsale of new shares of stock. Thus far in the chapter, the cost of equity capital calculations have assumed that\nthe earnings were being retained for equity capital financing.\nThe net income that is left after all expenses are paid is the residual income that belongs to the shareholders.\nInstead of receiving a fixed payment for letting the firm use their capital (like bondholders who receive fixed\ninterest payments), the reward to shareholders for letting the company use their capital varies from year to\nyear. In a good year, net income and the reward to shareholders is high. In a poor year, net income is low or\nperhaps even negative.\nThe net income can either be paid immediately and directly to shareholders in the form of dividends or be\nretained within the company to fund growth. Shareholders are willing to allow the company to retain these\nearnings because they expect that the money will be used to fund profitable projects, leading to an even larger\nreward for shareholders in future years.\nAlthough managers do not need to actively solicit the funds that are retained to fund the business, managers\ncannot view these funds as costless. The shareholders will require a return on those funds to entice them to\nallow the company to delay paying the dollars to them immediately in terms of a dividend.\nSuppose a company has $1 million in net income one year. If it pays $250,000 in dividends and retains\n$750,000, then it can finance $750,000 more in assets. If the company has a capital structure of 25% debt and\n75% equity and wants to maintain that capital structure, it must increase its debt by $250,000 to balance the\nincrease in equity. Thus, the company would be increasing its total financing by $1 million. Of that financing,\n25% would be debt financing, and 75% would be equity financing.\nTo increase its assets by more than $1 million, the company would need to decide to either change its capital\nstructure or issue new stock. Consider the firm represented by the market-value balance sheet in Figure 17.5.\nThe firm has $900 million in assets. These assets are financed by $225 million in debt capital and $675 million\nin equity capital, resulting in a capital structure of 25% debt and 75% equity.\nFigure 17.5 Market-Value Balance Sheet for a Company with $900 Million in Assets and a Capital Structure of 25% Debt and\n75% Equity\nThe retained earnings of $750,000 cause the equity on the balance sheet to increase to $675.75 million.

If, in this example, the flotation cost is $0.25 per\nshare, then the cost of raising new equity capital is\nIssuing new common equity is the most expensive form of raising capital. Equity capital is already expensive\nbecause the common shareholders are the residual claimants who will only be paid if all other claimants are\npaid.

These corporate bonds have a provision that gives the bondholder\nthe option of converting each bond held into a fixed number of shares of common stock. The number of\ncommon shares the bondholder would receive for each bond is known as the conversion ratio.\nSuppose that you own a convertible bond issued by Sheridan Sodas with a face value of $1,000 and a\nconversion ratio of 20 shares that matures today. If you convert the bond today, you will receive 20 shares of\nSheridan common stock. If you do not convert, you will receive $1,000. If you convert, you are basically paying\n$1,000 for 20 shares of Sheridan stock. The conversion price is\nIf Sheridan is trading for more\nthan $50 per share, you would want to convert. If Sheridan is trading for less than $50 per share, you would\nnot want to convert; you would prefer the $1,000. In other words, you will choose to convert whenever the\nstock price exceeds the conversion price at maturity.\nA convertible bond gives the holder an option; the bondholder is able to choose between the face value cash\nor receiving shares of stock. Options always have a positive value to holders. It is always preferable to be able\nto choose $1,000 or shares of stock than to simply be given $1,000. There is a possibility that the shares of\nstock will be more valuable, and there is no way the choice can put you in a worse position.\nBecause holders of convertible bonds have the valuable option of conversion that holders of nonconvertible\nbonds do not have, convertible debt can be offered with a lower interest rate. It might seem as if the firm\ncould lower its weighted average cost of capital by issuing convertible debt rather than nonconvertible debt.\nHowever, this is not the case. Remember that holders of convertible bonds choose whether they would prefer\nto convert the bond and become a stockholder or receive the face value of the bond at maturity.\nIf a bond has a face value of $1,000, the convertible bond holders will consider whether the stock they can\nconvert to is worth more than $1,000. Only when the price of the stock has increased enough that the value of\nthe stock received is more than $1,000 will the bondholders convert. However, this means that instead of\npaying $1,000, the firm is paying the bondholder in stock worth more than $1,000. In essence, the firm (and\nthe current shareholders) would be selling an equity position in the company for less than the market price of\nthat equity position. The lower interest rate compensates for the possibility that conversion will occur.\n528\n17 • How Firms Raise Capital\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSummary\n17.1 The Concept of Capital Structure\nCapital structure refers to how a company finances its assets. The two main sources of capital are debt\nfinancing and equity financing. A cost of capital exists because investors want a return equivalent to what they\nwould receive on an investment with an equivalent risk to persuade them to let the company use their funds.\nThe market values of debt and equity are used to calculate the weights of the components of the capital\nstructure.\n17.2 The Costs of Debt and Equity Capital\nThe yield to maturity (YTM) on a company’s outstanding bonds represents the return that debt holders are",

It uses financial statements to understand its\nprofitability and current financial position, to manage cash flow, and to communicate its finances to outside\nparties such as investors, governing bodies, and lenders. We will use Clear Lake’s company information and\nhistorical financial statements in this chapter as we explore its forecasting process. It’s important to note that\nin this chapter, we are focusing on just one firm and the one method its managers have chosen to forecast\nfinancial performance. There are a variety of types of firms in actual application, and they may choose to\nforecast their financial performance differently. We are demonstrating just one approach here.\nThe balance sheet shows all the firm’s assets, liabilities, and equity at one point in time. It also supports the\naccounting equation in a very clear and transparent way. We find one section of the balance sheet contains all\ncurrent and noncurrent assets that must total the other section of the balance sheet: total liabilities and\nequity. In Figure 18.2, we see that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has total assets of $250,000 in the current year,\nwhich balances with its total liabilities and equity of $250,000.\n536\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.2 Balance Sheet\nThe income statement reflects the performance of the firm over a period of time. It includes net sales, cost of\ngoods sold, operating expenses, and net income. In Figure 18.3, we see that Clear Lake had $120,000 in net\nsales, $60,000 in cost of goods sold, and $35,000 in net income in the current year.\nFigure 18.3 Full Income Statement\nFinally, the statement of cash flows is used to reconcile net income to cash balances. The statement begins\nwith net income, then reflects adjustments to balance sheet accounts and noncash expenses. The statement of\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n537\ncash flows is broken down into three key categories: operating, investing, and financing. This allows users to\nclearly see what elements of the business are generating or using cash. In Figure 18.4, we see that Clear Lake\nhad cash flow from operating activities of $53,600, cash used for investing activities of ($18,600), and cash\nused for financing activities of ($15,000).\nFigure 18.4 Statement of Cash Flows\nAnother key concept to remember about the financial statements is that the statement of cash flows is\nnecessary to truly understand how the firm is using and generating cash. A common misconception is that if a\nfirm reports net income on its income statement, then it must have plenty of cash, and if it reports a loss, it\nmust be short on cash. Although this can be true, it’s not necessarily the case. Historically speaking, we need\nthe statement of cash flows to get the full picture of how cash was used or generated in the past. Looking to\nthe future, we need a cash flow forecast to plan for possible gaps in cash flow and, potentially, how to make\nthe best use of any cash surplus. Throughout this chapter, we will see how to use historical financial\nstatements to help develop the future cash forecast.\nIt’s also important to remember that the four financial statements are tied together. Net income from the\nincome statement feeds into retained earnings, which live on the balance sheet. Equity balances on the\nbalance sheet feed information to the statement of stockholders’ equity. And information from both the\nincome statement (net income and noncash expenses) and the balance sheet (changes in working capital\naccounts) all feed into the statement of cash flows. These relationships will be helpful to understand when\nusing historical statements and preparing forecasts.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\nFully understanding the items that are on the balance sheet and how they relate to one another and to other\nfinancial statements will help you create a financial forecast. In Financial Statements, you learned that on the\nclassified balance sheet, both assets and liabilities are broken down into current and noncurrent categories.\nYou also know that the balance sheet must live up to its name—it must balance.

Seeing each\nitem as a percentage—that is, seeing its relationship to total assets—is also helpful for assessing historical\nstatements and how those percentages or relationships can be used to predict future balances in the forecast.\nFor example, in Figure 18.5, you can see that Clear Lake’s current assets represented 80% of its total assets in\nboth the current and prior years.\nFigure 18.5 Common-Size Balance Sheet\nIncome Statement Analysis\nLike balance sheet analysis, income statement analysis is also quite helpful in preparing for the forecasting\nprocess. In Financial Statements, you learned that the income statement is commonly broken down into a few\nsections. Cost of goods sold is deducted from net sales to arrive at gross margin. Gross margin refers to the\nprofits earned solely on the sale of the product itself, without consideration for the expenses incurred to run\nthe business. Next, operating expenses are deducted to reflect operating income. Operating income reflects\nthe profits of the core business function. Finally, other items, such as interest expense, tax expense, and other\ngains and losses, are deducted to arrive at net income, a.k.a. the bottom line. Each segment of the income\nstatement is helpful for assessing past performance and estimating future expenses for a forecast.\nYou continued your financial statement development in Measures of Financial Health, where you saw how to\n18.1 • The Importance of Forecasting\n539\nuse elements of the income statement to assess historical financial performance. Ratios based on the income\nstatement can be useful for understanding relationships between net sales and expenses—how they related in\nthe past and then, in forecasting, how those relationships might change or remain the same. Examples of\nincome statement ratios include gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin. Common ratios that\nincorporate items from both the balance sheet and the income statement include return on assets (ROA),\nreturn on equity (ROE), inventory turnover, accounts receivable turnover, and accounts payable turnover.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPerformance Trends\nReview the most recent annual report for Big 5 Sporting Goods (https://openstax.org/r/\nannual_report_for_Big_5_Sporting-Goods).

We will be using the\npercent-of-sales method to forecast some expenses for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the example used\nthroughout the chapter. This method relies on sales data, further highlighting why accuracy in forecasting\nsales is crucial.\nSales as the Driver\nA significant portion of a business’s costs are driven by how much it sells. Thus, the sales forecast is the\nnecessary first step in preparing a financial forecast. Common costs driven by sales include direct product\ncosts, direct labor costs, and other key variable costs (i.e., costs that vary proportionately to sales), such as\nsales commissions.\nLooking to the Past\nForecasting sales is not always an easy task, as no one knows the future. We can, however, use the information\nwe do have to forecast future sales with the greatest accuracy possible. Most firms start by looking at the past.\nA firm may look at past sales from a variety of prior periods. It’s common to look at the past 12 months to\nestimate the coming 12 months. Looking at 12 consecutive months helps identify seasonality of sales trends,\nwhat time of year sales tend to drop off and when they increase, possible sales spikes that might reoccur, and\nany other trends that tend to appear over a 12-month period. In Figure 18.7, we see Clear Lake’s sales by\nmonth for the past 12 months.\nPast data is often used in conjunction with probabilities and weighted average calculations derived from\nprobabilities. Though used in several areas of forecasting, this approach is particularly common in drafting the\nsales forecast. Using multiple scenarios and the probability of each scenario occurring is a common approach\nto estimating future sales.\nFigure 18.7 Historical Sales Data\nWe can see at first glance that sales remain fairly steady from January to April. Sales then goes up significantly\nin April and May, seem to peak in June, taper off a bit in July, then decline steeply from August to the end of the\nyear, with the lowest sales being in November and December. Though not exact, it’s easy to quickly see that\nsales follow a seasonal pattern. We will focus on just one year of data here to keep things simple. However, it’s\nimportant to note that when a firm has a seasonal sales pattern, it normally uses more than one year of data\nto detect and evaluate the pattern. It’s not uncommon for firms to have a seasonal sales pattern that\nfluctuates based on an external factor such as weather patterns, patterns in business or demand, or other\n18.2 • Forecasting Sales\n541\nfactors such as holidays. Common examples might include farm-based businesses that function on a weather\npattern for harvesting and selling crops or a toy company that fluctuates around gift-giving holidays.\nThis knowledge is helpful when assembling a first pass at the next year’s sales forecast. Using common-size\nand horizontal (trend) analyses on sales is also helpful, as shown in Figure 18.8. We can see the exact\npercentages that sales went up or down each month:\n•\nIn January, the company had sales of $9,000, which was\nof the total annual sales.\n•\nIn June, the company had $19,000 sales, which was\nof the total annual sales and\nof January sales.\nFigure 18.8 Historical Sales Data as Percentages\nOnce a baseline in the 12-month period is assessed, it can also be helpful to look for trends in other ways. For\nexample, the past several years might be assessed to see if there is a trend in total growth or decline for those\nyears on a summary basis or by period. Clear Lake Sporting Goods had sales in the current year of $126,000, in\nthe prior year of $105,000, and two years ago of $89,000. This reflects a 20% increase and an 18% increase,\nrespectively. It might be reasonable to expect a roughly 18 to 20% increase in total sales in the future with only\nthis information in mind. Keep in mind that we will learn about many other factors to consider in the forecast,\nso the 18 to 20% increase is a good general guideline to consider along with other factors.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nSales Forecast for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nReview the 2020 annual report for Big 5 Sporting Goods (https://openstax.org/r/\n2020_annual_report_for_Big_5_Sporting_Goods).

Financial statements provide a great starting point for analysis, as we can see the\nrelationships between sales and costs on the income statement and the relationships between total assets and\nline items on the balance sheet.\nFor example, in Figure 18.6, we saw that for the past two years, cost of goods sold has been 50% of sales. Thus,\nin the first draft of a forecast for Clear Lake, it’s likely that managers would estimate cost of goods sold at 50%\nof their forecasted sales. We can begin to see why forecasting sales first is crucial and why doing so as\naccurately as possible is also important.\nSelect Variables to Use\nA simple way to begin a full financial statement forecast might be to simply use the common-size statements\nand forecast every item using historical percentages. It’s a logical way to begin a very rough draft of the\nforecast. However, several variables should be taken into consideration. First, managers must address the cost\nof an account and determine if it’s a variable or fixed item. Variable costs tend to vary directly and\nproportionally with production or sales volume. Common examples include direct labor and direct materials.\nFixed costs, on the other hand, do not change when production or sales volume increases or decreases within\nthe relevant range. Granted, if production were to increase or decrease by a large amount, fixed costs would\nindeed change. However, in normal month-to-month changes, fixed costs often remain the same. Common\nexamples of fixed costs include rent and managerial salaries.\nSo, if we were to approach our common-size income statement, for example, we would likely use the\npercentage of sales as a starting point to forecast variable items such as cost of goods sold. However, fixed\ncosts may not be accurately forecast as a percentage of sales because they won’t actually change with sales.\nThus, we would likely look at the history of the dollar values of fixed costs in order to forecast them.\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\nCOVID-19 Makes Forecasting Difficult for Big 5 Sporting Goods\nBig 5 Sporting Goods announced record earnings in the third quarter of 2020, attributing its huge success\nthat quarter to the impact of people’s reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many people in\n18.3 • Pro Forma Financials\n545\nquarantine still wanting to make healthy lifestyle choices, sporting goods stores were making record sales.\nRecord-breaking sales, however, are not certain in the future.

This is because the past isn’t always a perfect indicator of the future, and our finances don’t\nalways follow a linear pattern. We use the past as a good starting point; then, we must assess what else we\nknow to fine-tune and make adjustments to the forecast.\nMany items impact the forecast, and they will vary from one organization to another. The key is to do research,\ngather data, and look around at the market, the economy, the competition, and any other factors that have the\npotential to impact the future sales, costs, and financial health of the company. Though certainly not an\nexhaustive list, here are a few examples of items that may impact Clear Lake Sporting Goods.\n•\nIt has an old product line that was discontinued in early October, contributing to a 2% reduction in\nmonthly sales that will likely continue into the new year until a new line begins arriving in stores.\n•\nIt will be adding a new brand to its collection of fishing supplies in March. The manufacturer plans to\nbegin running commercials in late February. Managers anticipate that this will increase Clear Lake’s\nmonthly sales by about $500 in March, $1,000 in April, $1,400 in May, and $2,000 per month in June, July,\nand August.\n•\nThe company has just finished updating its employee compensation package. It goes into effect in January\nof the new year and will result in an overall 4% increase in the cost of labor.\n•\nThe landlord indicated that rent will increase by $50 per month starting July 1.\n•\nSome fixed assets will be fully depreciated by the end of March. Thus, depreciation expense will go down\nby $25 per month beginning in April.\n•\nThere are rumors of new regulations that will impact the costs of importing some of the more difficult-to-\nobtain hunting supplies.

Figure 18.13 shows the next 12 months’ forecast for Clear Lake Sporting\nGoods using all of this data.\nFigure 18.13 Forecasted Income Statement\nForecast the Balance Sheet\nNow that we have a reasonable income statement forecast, we can move on to the balance sheet. The balance\nsheet, however, is entirely different from the income statement. It requires a bit more research and additional\nassumptions. Just like the income statement, it’s often a work in progress. A first draft is a good starting point,\nbut adjustments must be made once it is created, and all the interrelationships between the statements, cash\nflow in particular, are taken into consideration.\nThe balance sheet is a bit more difficult to forecast because the statement reflects balances at just a given\npoint in time. Account balances change daily, so forecasting just one snapshot in time for each month can be a\nchallenge. A good starting point is to assess general company financial policies or rules of thumb. For\nexample, assume that Clear Lake pays most of its vendors on net 30-day terms. A good way to forecast\naccounts payable on the balance sheet might be to add up the cost of goods sold from the forecasted income\nstatement for the prior month. For example, in Figure 18.14, we see that Clear Lake has forecasted its accounts\npayable for March as the cost of goods sold in March from its forecasted income statement.\nFor accounts receivable, Clear Lake generally receives payment from customers within net 90-day terms. Thus,\nit uses the sum of the current and prior two months’ forecasted sales to estimate its accounts receivable\nbalance.\nInventory will vary throughout the year. For the first six months, the company tries to build inventory for four\nmonths of sales. Once the busy season hits, inventory goes down to three months’ worth of future sales, then\nfinally drops to only two months of sales in December. Thus, managers use their sales forecast by month to\nestimate their inventory ending balance each month.\nThe equipment balance is forecasted by reducing the prior month’s balance by the forecasted depreciation\nexpense on the forecasted income statement.\nUnearned revenue is historically around 50% of the current month’s sales. Thus, Clear Lake estimates its\nunearned revenue balance each month by taking the current month’s net sales from the forecasted income\nstatement and multiplying it by 50%.\nShort-term investments, notes payable, and common stock are not anticipated to change, so the current\nbalance is forecasted to remain the same for the next 12 months.\n548\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nTo forecast the ending balance for retained earnings for each month, managers add the monthly net income\nfrom the forecasted balance sheet to the prior balance and subtract a quarterly $10,000 dividend.\nOnce all of these accounts are completed, the balance sheet is out of balance. Given that all of these events\nare somewhat related but are not tied together dollar for dollar, it’s not surprising when the forecasted\nbalance sheet is finished and does not balance. To complete the first draft (see Figure 18.14), the cash account\nis used as a variable and plugged in to make the balance sheet balance. Notice that by the end of the year, the\ncompany has $59,905 in cash. However, look at what happens midyear—the cash account falls to only $8,782.\nIn the next section, we will generate a cash flow forecast, which will allow Clear Lake to update its balance\nsheet forecast once it estimates what it will do to cover the cash flow gaps.\nFigure 18.14 Forecasted Balance Sheet Draft\nLinkages between the Forecasted Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\nNotice that in the discussion in the prior section on the balance sheet forecast, a lot of the information in the\nforecasted income statement was used to generate the forecasted balance sheet. The balance sheet accounts\ngenerally depend on activity reported in the income statement. For example, for many firms, the balance in\ntheir accounts receivable account is tied to their sales. Looking at historical balances in the accounts receivable\naccount and how those relate to historical sales will help determine how to use the forecasted future sales to\nestimate the future balance of accounts receivable.\nThe same is true of accounts payable. Looking at past balances, past expenses (normally cost of goods sold),\nand the firm’s payment terms for its vendors allows managers to use forecasted cost of goods sold or other\nexpenses to estimate the balance in the accounts payable account.\nWe learned in Financial Statements that net income flows into retained earnings. Thus, the net income from\nthe forecasted income statement can be used to help estimate the ending balance in retained earnings. If the\nfirm intends to issue any dividends in the coming year, managers should also estimate that reduction in their\nforecast.",

A cash forecast begins with the beginning cash balance, adds anticipated cash\ninflows, and deducts anticipated cash outflows. This identifies cash surpluses and shortages.\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, for example, we see in Figure 18.15 that the company begins with cash of\n$42,581,000 in January of the new year. Next, it lists the cash inflows, or cash received from customers. Given\nthe assumption that customers pay in 90-day terms, the cash flow is filled in by plugging in the sales forecast\nfor the three prior months. For example, the cash flow from customers of $10,508 for June is the same as the\nnet sales forecast for March (see Figure 18.13).\nFigure 18.15 Forecasted Cash Inflows\nNext, Clear Lake identifies cash outflows, which include accounts payable, salaries, rent, utilities, dividends,\nand interest payments. Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent. Utilities,\nlike accounts payable, are assumed to be paid within 30 days. Thus, the cash outflow for utilities is the utilities\nexpense for the prior month from the forecasted income statement.\nManagement intends to pay a quarterly dividend of $10,000. Thus, in Figure 18.16, we see $10,000 cash\noutflows forecasted for March, June, September, and December. Interest on the long-term liability is paid\nquarterly. Thus, the $500 cash outflows in March, June, September, and December are simply the monthly\ninterest expense of $167 from the income statement, summed for each quarter.\n550\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.16 Forecasted Cash Inflows and Outflows\nUsing a Cash Forecast to Determine Additional Funds Needed\nFinally, at the end of the cash flow forecast, cash outflows are subtracted from the cash inflows. This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March. It has an estimated surplus in April, so $3,000\nof the borrowing is returned.\nFigure 18.17 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nAssessing the Value of Growth\nIt’s a fairly common assumption that most, if not all, businesses want to grow.

A firm can grow in\nsize based on customers, employees, locations, or simply sales. However, that doesn’t mean that the growth\nwill increase profits. Growth may increase profits, but this is not a safe assumption. Scaling up operations\ntakes careful planning, which includes monitoring the profitability of the sales and, of course, the cash flow it\n18.5 • Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\n551\nwould require. Growing a business can require more inventory, more locations, more equipment, and more\nmanpower, all of which cost money. Even if the forecasted growth is profitable, it may pose problems from a\ncash flow perspective. It’s important that the firm review not only its forecasted income statement and\nbalance sheet but also its cash forecast, as this can reveal some serious gaps in funding depending on the\nextent, timing, and nature of the planned growth.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake Sporting Goods intends to run a large-scale ad campaign to boost sales\nin its busy season. Historically, the store relied primarily on its prime location for high volumes of retail foot\ntraffic. Managers felt, however, that given the increase in competition, they could boost sales significantly by\nrunning the ad campaign in the first quarter. The campaign would cost $30,000. Forecasts already reflect a\ncash deficit at the end of the first quarter of $13,000, so the additional $30,000 ad campaign, which would\nrequire payment up front, would create a much larger need for funding. It’s also important that managers\nlook at the increased cost of doing business along with the increased cost in advertising to ensure that the\nmove would be profitable. Fortunately, Excel or other forecasting software can be used to create a forecast\nwith formulas that tie together, making scenario analysis such as this a much easier process.\nScenarios in Forecasting\nForecasting is almost never a linear process. In other words, we don’t do one forecast and call it good. The first\ndraft is completed using historical data, and then changes are made a bit at a time as all potential variables are\nassessed for their impact on the forecast. It’s quite common to then use the work-in-progress forecast to\ncomplete scenario analysis. This is particularly true when the forecast is completed in Excel or other budgeting\nor forecasting software. Elements of the forecast can be changed to see what the overall impact would be to\nthe firm. Assuming the forecast is set up using formulas in Excel or other software, a change to one figure or\none variable would then “ripple” through the forecast to reflect the overall impact.\nOften, a firm may complete an initial forecast (scenario) under the assumption that the economy is in a\n“normal state.” The firm can then alter the initial forecast for different scenarios, such as the economy in a\nrecession or the economy in a state of expansion. This helps the firm understand different possible future\nstates and highlights how changes in the economy such as inflation may cause revenue and expenses to\nincrease.\nAssume that Clear Lake’s initial forecast is created under the assumption that the economy will remain\naverage. Management also wants to know the worst-case scenario. What will their financial results look like if\nthe economy were in a recession, for example? If management assumes their sales would drop to only 60% of\nthe prior year sales in a recessionary economy, they could alter the formula in Excel driving their sales and\nvariable costs, resulting in a new pro forma income statement. In Figure 18.18, we can see that net income\nwould drop to $16,391 under this assumption, compared to the net income of $47,653 forecasted under\naverage economy assumptions in Figure 18.13.\n552\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.18 Forecasted Cash Surplus or Deficit\nThough creating a full forecast in Excel can be a bit complex, it is a powerful tool that is useful for analysis.\nElements can be used to vary just about anything, from something small such as a 1% increase in the cost of a\nproduct to a company-wide increase in salaries, the introduction of an entire new product line, or the purchase\nof a new production machine, among other possibilities.\nFor example, assume that Clear Lake has completed a first pass at its forecast and is reviewing the forecasted\nprofit for the next 12 months. Managers feel the profit is currently low, as they always want to target a certain\npercentage. They might tinker with variables in the forecast file to see the impact on profits of potential",

In Figure 18.19, we see in cell B5 that the forecasted income\nstatement sheet is linked to the percent of annual sales from the Prior Year Income Statement (Figure\n18.12) sheet. Then, in cell B4, January sales are estimated with a formula that multiplies the total\nforecasted sales in O4 by the percent of annual sales for January of the prior year. Notice that the formula\nthen multiplies that product by 0.98. This is because Clear Lake discontinued a product line in the last\nquarter of the prior year, and management feels that this will reduce sales in the first quarter of the new\nyear by roughly 2%.\nFigure 18.19 Forecasted Sales Formulas in Excel\n3.\nAs Clear Lake continues to fill out its forecasted income statement, the next formula we see is a simple\nsum formula to calculate net sales in B8 (see Figure 18.20). It’s a simple formula that subtracts sales\nreturns and allowances in B7 from gross sales in B4. Similar formulas are also found in B10 for gross\nmargin and B18 for net income.\n4.\nIn cell B9, we see a multiplication formula that multiplies sales from B4 by 0.5, or 50%. This is because\n554\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmanagement feels that cost of goods sold will remain the same as last year, in most quarters at least, and\nlast year’s percentage was 50%.\n5.\nRent, depreciation, and salaries are all simply typed in, as they are fixed expenses that remain the same as\nlast year.\n6.\nThe utilities calculation, found in cell B14, is somewhat similar to the sales calculation. The total utilities\nexpense from O14 is multiplied by the current month’s sales in B4 divided by the total annual sales in O4.\nThis spreads out the utility cost by month based on the percentage of annual sales.\nFigure 18.20 Forecasted Income Statement Formulas\nClear Lake’s forecasted balance sheet ties very closely to both the forecasted income statement and the prior\nyear’s income statement. In Figure 18.21, we see in C7 an addition formula using the sum of the current\nmonth and three months of prior sales as an estimate of the ending accounts receivable balance. The formula\nfor inventory is similar but forward looking. In C8, inventory is estimated by adding the cost of goods sold for\nthe current month and next three months from the forecasted income statement.\nTotal current assets in C10 is calculated with a SUM formula that adds together the values in all the selected\ncells. Amounts such as short-term investments and common stock that are not anticipated to change are\nsimply typed as a number in the cell. Much like in the income statement, subtotals are found in C13 for total\nassets, C17 for current liabilities, C24 for total equity, and C25 for total liabilities and equity. Retained earnings\nin C23 pulls the ending retained earnings balance from the end of last year (hidden in column B) and adds the\n18.6 • Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\n555\nnet income for January in the forecasted income statement to get the current month’s ending balance.\nFigure 18.21 Forecasted Balance Sheet Formulas\nMuch like the balance sheet, the cash forecast also relies heavily on data from the forecasted income\nstatement as well as the forecasted balance sheet. To begin the year, in Figure 18.22, we see that the formula\nin B4 pulls the cash balance from the forecasted balance sheet. In B6, the formula pulls the sales for the three\nmonths prior from the previous year’s income statement. This is because it’s assumed that cash is collected\nfrom customers 90 days after the sale. The same approach is used for accounts payable, rent, salaries, and\nutilities. The formulas pull the expenses from a prior month depending on the assumed timing for payment.\nUtilities, for example, are assumed to be paid within 30 days, so the cash outflow in February is assumed to be\nthe utilities expense for January from the forecasted income statement. Note that interest payments are\nassumed to be zero in January and February, but in March, the formula in D14 sums the interest expenses on\nthe forecasted income statement for January, February, and March. This is because interest is paid quarterly.\nFinally, note the formula in C4. The beginning cash balance for a given month is the same as the ending cash\nbalance from the prior month; thus, the figure in B18 is linked to C4 to start the new month.\n556\n18 • Financial Forecasting\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 18.22 Cash Forecast Formulas\nUsing Excel Functions to Balance\nOnce we get a draft of the forecasts outlined, then the tinkering starts.

We can do\nthis with a simple formula that compares total assets to total liabilities and equity. We can see in Figure 18.23\nthat subtracting one from the other in cell C27 should result in $0.

In finance, it’s most\nimportant for assessing the value of future growth plans and planning for future cash flow needs.\n18.2 Forecasting Sales\nThe sales forecast is the foundation on which much of the rest of the forecast is built. Thus, the sales forecast\nis completed first. Historical sales data and any other information on the firm, its products, the economy, its\ncustomers, and its competitors are all used to create the most accurate sales forecast possible.\n18.3 Pro Forma Financials\nPro forma financial statements are forward looking in nature. They use the sales forecast, historical data,\nfinancial statement analyses, relationships between accounts and statements, and any other information\nknown about the firm, the environment, and the future to create the most accurate financial statement\nforecast possible.\n18.4 Generating the Complete Forecast\nInterrelationships among historical data, the forecasted income statement, and the forecasted balance sheet\nare all used to estimate each line item in the financial statements.\n18.5 Forecasting Cash Flow and Assessing the Value of Growth\nOnce the income statement and balance sheet forecasts are complete, data from those statements,\ninformation on company policies, and account relationships are used to generate a cash forecast. The cash\nforecast is important for identifying any gaps in cash flow so that financial managers can plan for cash needs.\nIt’s also important to review not only the cash forecast but all forecasted financial statements to assess the\noverall impact and value of proposed firm growth.\n18.6 Using Excel to Create the Long-Term Forecast\nExcel can be a powerful tool for creating financial forecasts. Formulas that complete mathematical functions\nand tie accounts and financial statements together are used to create the statements, ensure that they\nbalance, and facilitate scenario and sensitivity analyses.\nKey Terms\nbalance sheet\na financial statement that reflects a firm’s asset, liability, and equity account balances at a\ngiven point in time\ncash deficit\nan excess of cash outflows over cash inflows for a given period\ncash forecast\na financial statement that estimates a firm’s future cash inflows and outflows\ncash surplus\nan excess of cash inflows over cash outflows for a given period\ncommon-size\ndescribes a financial statement in which each element is expressed as a percentage of a base\namount\nfinancing activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that reflect the use\nof financed funds\nforecast\nan estimate of future performance based on historical performance and other contextual\ninformation\nincome statement\na financial statement that measures a firm’s financial performance over a given period of\ntime\ninvesting activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that reflect the\nacquisition or disposal of long-term assets\n18 • Summary\n559\noperating activities\ncash business transactions reported on the statement of cash flows that relate to\nongoing day-to-day operations\npro forma\nin the context of financial statements, forward-looking\nscenario analysis\nanalysis of how various situations and circumstances would impact the financial forecast\nsensitivity analysis",

On December 31, a company has the following balances and gross working capital:\nThink of the $1,105,000 of gross working capital as a source of funds for the most pressing obligations (i.e.,\ncurrent liabilities) of the company. Gross working capital is available to pay the bills. However, some of the\ncurrent assets would need to be converted to cash first. Accounts receivable need to be collected, and\ninventory would need to be sold before it too can become cash. What if the company had $600,000 of current\nliabilities? That amount of current obligations could not be paid out of cash until the marketable securities\nwere sold and a significant portion of accounts receivable were collected.\nThe second, more refined and useful concept of working capital is net working capital:\nFor example, if a company has $1,000,000 of current assets and $750,000 of current liabilities, its net working\ncapital would be $250,000 ($1,000,000 less $750,000).\nNWC provides a better picture because it takes into account the liability “coverage” provided by the current\nassets. As the above example shows, the current assets would “cover” the current liabilities with an excess of\n$250,000. Think of it this way: if the current assets could be converted to cash, they could be used to meet the\ncurrent obligations with another $250,000 of cash leftover.\nCurrent liabilities include\n•\naccounts payable;\n•\ndividends payable;\n•\nnotes payable (due within a year);\n•\ncurrent portion of deferred revenue;\n•\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt;\n•\ninterest payable;\n•\nincome taxes payable; and\n•\naccrued expenses such as compensation owed to employees.\nNet working capital possibilities can be thought of as a spectrum from negative working capital to positive, as\n19.1 • What Is Working Capital?\n567\nexplained in Table 19.1.\nNegative Net Working Capital\nZero Net Working Capital\nPositive Net Working Capital\nCurrent liabilities are greater than\ncurrent assets.\nCurrent assets equal current\nliabilities.\nCurrent assets are greater than\ncurrent liabilities.\nCould indicate a liquidity problem.\nThere is difficulty satisfying current\nobligations.\nIndicates that current assets could\ncover current obligations. However,\nthere is no positive margin (safety\ncushion) or “liquid reserve” to\nsatisfy unexpected cash needs.\nIndicates that the company can\nmeet its current obligations.\nHowever, excessively high net\nworking capital could mean too\nlittle cash and therefore an\nopportunity cost (forgoing rates of\nreturn on alternative investment).\nTable 19.1 Spectrum of Net Working Capital\nMeasures of Financial Health provides information on a variety of financial ratios to help users of financial\nstatements understand the strengths and weakness of companies’ financial statements. Three of the financial\nratios covered in that chapter are brought back into this chapter’s discussion to demonstrate how financial\nmanagers examine working capital and liquidity. Liquidity is the ease with which an asset can be converted\ninto cash. Those ratios are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the cash ratio. A higher ratio indicates a\ngreater level of liquidity.\nThe formulas for the three liquidity ratios are:\nNotice how the current ratio includes the two elements of net working capital—current assets and current\nliabilities. It makes for a quick comparison of relative size or proportion.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCurrent Ratio\nA company has $2,000,000 of current assets, while its current liabilities are $1,000,000. What is the current\nratio, and what does it mean?\nSolution:\nThe current ratio would be\nwhich is a 2:1 proportion of current asset value to\nthe amount of the current liabilities. This means that if all the current assets could be converted to cash,\nthen the current liabilities could be satisfied two times.\nThere are two drawbacks to the current ratio: (1) it is a working capital analytic as of a point in time but is not\nindicative of future liquidity or future cash flows and (2) as an indicator of liquidity, it can be deceptive if a\nsignificant proportion of the current assets are inventory, supplies, or prepaid expenses. Inventory is not very\nliquid as it can take an extended time period to convert to cash, and assets such as supplies and prepaid",

That is because purchases by Target’s customers who use\ntheir credit cards (e.g., VISA or MasterCard) create very short-term receivables—amounts that Target is waiting\nto collect but are very close to a cash sale. So instead of being reported as accounts receivable—a line item on\nthe Target balance sheet that is separate from cash and cash equivalents—these amounts receivable from\nthird-party financial institutions are considered part of the cash and cash equivalents and are a very liquid asst.\nFor example, the amount of $560,000,000 for January 30, 2021, is considered a cash equivalent since the\nsettlement of these accounts will happen in a day or two with cash deposited in Target’s bank accounts. When\na retailer sells product and accepts a credit card such as VISA, MasterCard, or American Express, the cash\ncollection happens very soon after the credit card sale—typically within 24 to 72 hours.3\nCompanies also invest excess funds in marketable securities. These are debt and equity investments such as\ncorporate and government bonds, preferred stock, and common stock of other entities that can be readily sold\non a stock or bond exchange. Ford Motor Company has this definition of marketable securities in its 2019\nAnnual Report (Form 10-K):\n“Investments in securities with a maturity date greater than three months at the date of purchase and other\nsecurities for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate, quoted\nprice, or penalty on withdrawal are classified as Marketable securities.”4\n19.4\nReceivables Management\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss how decisions on extending credit are made.\n•\nExplain how to monitor accounts receivables.\nFor any business that sells goods or services on credit, effective accounts receivable management is critical for\ncash flow and profitability planning and for the long-term viability of the company.

A cash deficiency\nmeans that some type of financing, such as a line of credit or bank loan, will be needed to\nprovide enough cash for operations and to maintain a minimum cash balance. This number is\nfound by subtracting the minimum cash balance from the preliminary ending cash balance.\nFor example, the cash surplus for January in Figure 19.10 is calculated with this formula:\n=B6-B7. Notice that all months in the Sample Cash Budget show a surplus except for August’s\nforecast of a deficit, which may require drawing on a line of credit to provide enough cash to\nmeet obligations in August.\nTable 19.5 Excel Formulas for Monthly Cash Budget\n19.6 • Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\n589\nSummary\n19.1 What Is Working Capital?\nWorking capital is not only necessary to run a business; it is a resource that will expand and contract with\nbusiness cycles and must be carefully managed and monitored. The daily, weekly, and monthly needs of\nbusiness operations are met by cash. Financial managers understand the significance of net working capital\n(current assets – current liabilities) and various liquidity ratios as they attempt to ensure that bills can be paid.\nThe cash conversion cycle and the cash budget provide additional working capital management tools.\n19.2 What Is Trade Credit?\nTrade credit is very prevalent in the business world, especially in B2B (business-to-business) transactions.\nMany business exchanges (sales) could not take place without trade credit and the credit terms that are\noffered. Like any component of working capital, trade credit must be planned and managed. The creditor (the\ncompany granting the credit) does so based on an analysis of creditworthiness and must monitor payments\nand manage slow-paying accounts. The debtor (accounts payable) needs to make payments on time to keep a\nclean credit history and to take advantage of discounts.\n19.3 Cash Management\nCash management is simply making sure you have enough cash to meet expected obligations and for\ncontingencies (unexpected or emergency cash needs). Excess cash should be invested low-risk and highly\nliquid marketable securities. The cash budget is a critical tool of cash management.\n19.4 Receivables Management\nAccounts receivables are monitored by management with tools such as the ratios accounts receivable turnover\nand average collection period and the aging of receivables. The credit managers’ mantra rings true: “The\nolder the receivable, the greater the likelihood that the account will not be collected.”\n19.5 Inventory Management\nInventory, usually the least liquid of the current assets, presents its own set of management challenges.\nFinding the optimal level of inventory is probably more of an art than a science. JIT helps to reduce the\ninvestment in inventory and lower the costs of storage, but stockout costs can be very damaging to\nprofitability.\n19.6 Using Excel to Create the Short-Term Plan\nShort-term plans of a business are funded with cash, with cash budgets being a critical tool of planning. The\ncash budget takes into account a target amount of cash, factoring in all the motives for holding cash. A cash\nbudget looks ahead—predicting cash inflows and outflows, allocating for minimum cash balances to be\nmaintained, and helping management determine short-term financing needed. Although it is the last budget\nprepared, the preparation of the cash budget is an important financial planning exercise of companies small\nand large.\nKey Terms\naccounts receivable aging schedule\na report that shows amounts owed by customers by the age of the\naccount, as measured by the number of days since the sale\nallowance for doubtful accounts\nan account that contains the estimated amount of accounts receivable\nthat will not be collected\nbad debt expense\nan expense that a business incurs as a result of uncollectible accounts receivables\nbankruptcies\nfederal court procedures that protect distressed businesses from creditor collection efforts\nwhile allowing the debtor firm to liquidate its assets or devise a reorganization plan\n590\n19 • Summary\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbenchmarking\nthe process of performance analysis that involves comparing financial condition and\noperating results against a standard, called a benchmark\nbill of lading\na document that is a detailed list of a goods that have been shipped; a receipt given by the\ncarrier (shipping company) to the seller as evidence that the goods have been shipped to the buyer\ncarrying costs\nall costs associated with having inventory in stock including storage costs, insurance,",

Rising costs could even cause the business to become unprofitable and close, causing\nmany employees to lose their jobs.

The three major areas of focus for the financial manager are the size, the timing, and the riskiness\nof the cash flows of the company. Broadly, the financial manager should work to\n•\nincrease cash coming into the company and decrease cash going out of the company;\n•\nspeed up cash coming into the company and slow down cash going out of the company; and\n•\ndecrease the riskiness of both money coming in and money going out of the company.\nThe first item in this list is obvious. The more revenue a company has, the more profitable it will be.\nBusinesspeople talk about “top line” growth when discussing this objective because revenue appears at the\ntop of the company’s income statement. Also, the lower the company’s expenses, the more profitable the\ncompany will be. When businesspeople talk about the “bottom line,” they are focused on what will happen to\na company’s net income. The net income appears at the bottom of the income statement and reflects the\namount of revenue left over after all of the company’s expenses have been paid.\nThe second item in the list—the speed at which money enters and exits the company—has been addressed\nthroughout this book.

One of the basic principles of finance is the time value of money—the idea that a dollar\nreceived today is more valuable than a dollar received tomorrow. Many of the topics explored in this book\nrevolve around the issue of the time value of money.\nThe focus of this chapter is on the third item in the list: risk. In finance, risk is defined as uncertainty. Risk\noccurs because you cannot predict the future. Compared to other business decisions, financial decisions are\ngenerally associated with contracts in which the parties of the contract fulfill their obligations at different\npoints in time. If you choose to purchase a loaf of bread, you pay the baker for the bread as you receive the\nbread; no future obligation arises for either you or the baker because of this purchase. If you choose to buy a\nbond, you pay the issuer of the bond money today, and in return, the issuer promises to pay you money in the\nfuture. The value of this bond depends on the likelihood that the promise will be fulfilled.\nBecause financial agreements often represent promises of future payment, they entail risk. Even if the party\nthat is promising to make a payment in the future is ethical and has every intention of honoring the promise,\nthings can happen that can make it impossible for them to do so. Thus, much of financial management hinges\non managing this risk.\nRisk and Firm Value\nYou would expect the managers of Starbucks Corporation to know a lot about coffee. They must also know a\nlot about risk. It is not surprising that the term coffee appears in the text of the company’s 2020 annual report\n179 times, given that the company’s core business is coffee. It might be surprising, however, that the term risk\nappears in the report 99 times.3 Given that the text of the annual report is less than 100 pages long, the word\nrisk appears, on average, more than once per page.\nStarbucks faces a number of different types of risk. In 2020, corporations experienced an unprecedented risk\nbecause of COVID-19. Coffee shops were forced to remain closed as communities experienced government-\n3\nStarbucks.

Locations that were able to service customers through drive-up windows were not\nimmune to declining revenue due to the pandemic. As fewer people gathered in the workplace, Starbucks\nexperienced a declining number of to-go orders from meeting attendees. In addition, Starbucks locations\nfaced the risk of illness spreading as baristas gathered in their buildings to fill to-go orders.\nWhile COVID-19 brought discussions of risk to the forefront of everyday conversations, risk was an important\nfocus of companies such as Starbucks before the pandemic began. (The term risk appeared in the company’s\n2019 annual report 82 times.4 ) Starbucks’s business model revolves around turning coffee beans into a\npleasurable drink. Anything that impacts the company’s ability to procure coffee beans, produce a drink, and\nsell that drink to the customer will impact the company’s profitability.\nThe investors in the company have allowed Starbucks to use its capital to lease storefronts, purchase espresso\nmachines, and obtain all of the assets necessary for the company to operate. Debt holders expect interest to\nbe paid and their principal to be returned. Stockholders expect a return on their investment. Because investors\nare risk averse, the riskier they perceive the cash flows they will receive from the business to be, the higher the\nexpected return they will require to let the company use their money. This required return is a cost of doing\nbusiness. Thus, the riskier the cash flows of a company, the higher the cost of obtaining capital. As any cost of\noperating a business increases, the value of the firm declines.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStarbucks\nThe most recent annual report for Starbucks Corp., along with the reports from recent years, is available on\nthe company’s investor relations website under the Financial Data section (https://openstax.org/r/\nFinancial_Data_section).

If,\nhowever, the spot exchange rate in six months is\n, the company will exercise the option\nand purchase each US dollar for only KWN 1,200.\nThe profitability, or the payoff, to the owner of a call option is represented by the chart in Figure 20.4 below.\nPossible spot prices are measured from left to right, and the financial gain or loss to the company of the\noption contract is measured vertically. If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised. The company paid KWN 50 for something that ended up being worthless.\nFigure 20.4 The Payoff to the Holder of a Call Option\nIf, in six months, the spot exchange rate is\n, then the company will choose to exercise\nthe option. The company will be saving KWN 25 for each dollar purchased, but the company originally paid 50\nKWN for the contract. So, the company will be 25 KWN worse off than if it had never purchased the call option.\nIf the spot exchange rate is\n, the company will be in exactly the same position having\npurchased and exercised the call option as it would have been if it had not purchased the option. At any spot\nprice higher than KWN 1,250/USD, the firm will be in a better financial position, or will have a positive payoff,\nbecause it purchased the call option. The more the Korean won depreciates over the next six months, the\nhigher the payoff to the firm of owning the call contract. Purchasing the call contract is a way that the\ncompany can protect itself from the currency exposure it faces.\nFor any transaction, there must be two parties—a buyer and a seller. For the company to have purchased the\ncall option, another party must have sold the call option. The seller of a call option is called the option writer.\nLet’s consider the potential benefits and risks to the writer of the call option.\nWhen the company purchases the call option, it pays the premium to the writer. The writer of the option does\nnot have a choice regarding whether the option will be exercised. The purchaser of the option has the right to\nmake the choice; in essence, the writer of the option sold the right to make that decision to the purchasers of\nthe call option.\n610\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 20.5 shows the payoff to the writer of the call option. Recall that the buyer of the call option will let the\noption expire if the spot rate is less than\nwhen the call option matures in six months. If\nthis occurs, the writer of the option collected the KWN 50 option premium when the contract was sold and\nthen never hears from the purchaser again. This is what the writer of the option is hoping for; the writer of the\ncall option profits when the options contract is not exercised\nFigure 20.5 The Payoff to the Writer of a Call Option\nIf the spot rate is above\n, then the holder of the option will choose to exercise the right\nto purchase the won at the option strike price. Then the writer of the option will be obligated to sell the Korean\nwon at a price of KWN 1,200/USD. If the spot rate is\n, the option writer will be obligated\nto sell the dollars for KWN 50 less than what they are worth; because the option writer was initially paid a KWN\n50 premium for taking on that obligation, the option writer will just break even. For any exchange rate higher\nthan\n, the writer of the call option will have a loss.\nThe option contract is a zero-sum game. Any payoff the owner of the option receives is exactly equal to the\nloss the writer of the option has. Any loss the owner of the option has is exactly equal to the payoff the writer\nof the option receives.\nPut Options\nWhile the call option you just considered gives the owner the right to buy an underlying asset, the put option\ngives the owner to right to sell an underlying asset. Take, for example, an Indian company that has a contract\nto provide graphic artwork for a US company. The US company will pay the Indian company 200,000 US dollars\nin three months.\nWhile the Indian company receives US dollars, it must pay its workers in Indian rupees. Because the company\ndoes not know what the spot exchange rate will be in three months, it faces transaction risk and may be\ninterested in hedging this exposure using a put option.\nThe company knows that the current spot rate is\n, meaning that the company would be able\nto use $200,000 to purchase\nif it possessed the $200,000 today. If\nthe Indian rupee appreciates relative to the US dollar over the next three months, however, the company will\nreceive fewer rupees when it makes the exchange; perhaps the company will not be able to purchase enough\nrupees to cover the wages of its employees.\nAssume the company can purchase a put option that gives it the right to sell US dollars in three months at a\nstrike price of INR 75/USD; the premium for this put option is INR 5.

The payoff to the company for the option is INR -5, the premium\nthat was paid for the option that was never used (see Figure 20.6).\nFigure 20.6 The Payoff to the Holder of a Put Option\nIf, however, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything less than\n, then the\ncompany will choose to exercise the option. If the spot rate is between\nand\n, the payoff for the option is negative. For example, if the spot exchange rate is\n, the company will exercise the option and receive three more Indian rupees per dollar than\nit would in the spot market. However, the company had to spend INR 5 for the option, so the payoff is INR -2.\nAt a spot exchange rate of\n, the company has a zero payoff; the benefit of exercising the\noption, INR 5, is exactly equal to the price of purchasing the option, the premium of INR 5.\nIf, in three months, the spot exchange rate is anything below\n, the payoff of the put option is\npositive. At the theoretical extreme, if the USD became worthless and would purchase no rupees in the spot\nmarket when the company received the dollars, the company could exercise its option and receive INR 75/USD,\nand its payoff would be INR 70.\nNow that we have considered the payoff to a purchaser of a put contract, let’s consider the opposite side of\nthe contract: the seller, or writer, of the put option. The writer of a put option is selling the right to sell dollars\nto the purchaser of the put option. The writer of the put option collects a premium for this. The writer of the\nput has no choice as to whether the put option will be exercised; the writer only has an obligation to honor the\ncontract if the owner of the put option chooses to exercise it.\nThe owner of the option will choose to let the option expire if the spot exchange rate is anything above\n. If that is the case, the writer of the put option collects the INR 5 premium for writing the\nput, as shown by the horizontal line in Figure 20.7. This is what the writer of the put is hoping will occur.\n612\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 20.7 The Payoff to the Writer of a Put Option\nThe owner of the option will choose to exercise the option if the exchange rate is less than\n.\nIf the spot exchange rate is between\nand\n, the writer of the put option has\na positive payoff. Although the writer must now purchase US dollars for a price higher than what the dollars\nare worth, the INR 5 premium that the writer received when entering into the position is more than enough to\noffset that loss.\nIf the spot exchange rate drops below\n, however, the writer of the put option is losing more\nthan INR 5 when the option is exercised, leaving the writer with a negative payoff. In the extreme, the writer of\nthe put will have to purchase worthless US dollars for INR 75/USD, resulting in a loss of INR 70.\nNotice that the payoff to the writer of the put is the negative of the payoff to the holder of the put at every\nspot price.

Just as other prices are volatile, interest rates are also\nvolatile. Just as volatility in other prices leads to uncertain cash flows for a company, volatility in interest rates\ncan also lead to uncertain cash flows.\nMeasuring Interest Rate Risk\nSuppose that a company is supposed to pay a bill of $1,000 in 10 years. The present value of this bill depends\non the level of interest rates. If the interest rate is 5%, the present value of the bill is\n. If\nthe interest rate rises to 6%, the present value of the bill is\n. The increase in the interest\nrate by 1% causes the present value of the expected cash flow to fall by\n.\nInterest rate risk can be highlighted by looking at bonds. Consider two $1,000 face value bonds with a 5%\ncoupon rate, paid semiannually. One of the bonds matures in five years, and the other bond matures in 30\nyears. If the market interest rate is 5%, each of these bonds will sell for face value, or $1,000. If, instead, the\nmarket interest rate is 6%, the five-year bond will sell for $957.35 and the 30-year bond will sell for $861.62.\nNotice that as the interest rate rises, the price of both of these bonds will fall. However, the price of the longer-\nterm bond will fall by more than the price of the shorter-term bond. The longer-term bond price will fall by\n1.38%; the shorter-term bond price will fall by only 0.43%.\nConsider two additional $1,000 face value bonds. The difference is that these bonds have a 6% coupon rate,\npaid semiannually. If a bond has a 6% coupon rate and matures in five years, it will sell for $1,043.76 when the\nmarket interest rate is 5%. A 30-year bond that matures in 30 years and has a 6% coupon rate will sell for\n$1,154.54 when the market interest rate is 5%. However, if the interest rate in the economy is 6%, both of these\nbonds will sell for a price of $1,000. The price of the five-year bond will drop by 4.19%; the price of the 30-year\nbond will drop by 13.39%.\nTHINK IT THROUGH\nCalculating Bond Prices as the Interest Rates Changes\nYou are considering purchasing a $10,000 face value bond with a 4% coupon rate, paid semiannually, that\nmatures in 20 years. If you require a 5% return to purchase this bond, what is the maximum price you\n614\n20 • Risk Management and the Financial Manager\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nwould be willing to pay for the bond? If, instead, you require an 8% return to purchase this bond, what is\nthe maximum price you would be willing to pay for the bond?\nSolution:\nIf the bond pays coupon interest semiannually, you will receive one-half of the face value of the bond\nmultiplied by the coupon rate every six months.

Duration is an\nimportant measure of interest rate risk that incorporates the maturity and coupon rate of a bond as well as\nthe level of current market interest rates. Calculating duration is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of\nthis introductory textbook, but it is useful to note that\n•\nthe higher the duration of a bond, the more sensitive the price of the bond will be to interest rate\n9\nThe specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n615\nchanges;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher when market yields are lower, all else being equal;\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the longer the maturity of the bond, all else being equal; and\n•\nthe duration of a bond will be higher the lower the coupon rate on the bond, all else being equal.\nSwap-Based Hedging\nAs the name suggests, a swap involves two parties agreeing to swap, or exchange, something. Generally, the\ntwo parties, known as counterparties, are swapping obligations to make specified payment streams.\nTo illustrate the basics of how an interest rate swap works, let’s consider two hypothetical companies, Alpha\nand Beta. Alpha is a strong, well-established company with a AAA (triple-A) bond rating. This means that Alpha\nhas the highest rating a company can have. With this high rating, Alpha can borrow at relatively low interest\nrates. Often, companies in this situation will borrow at a floating rate. This means that their interest rate goes\nup and down as interest rates in the overall economy vary. The floating rate will be tied to a benchmark rate\nthat is widely quoted in the financial press. Historically, companies have often used the London Interbank\nOffered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate. Because published quotes for LIBOR will be phased out by 2023,\nfirms are beginning to use alternative rates. As of yet, no single alternative has emerged as the most\ncommonly used rate; therefore, LIBOR will be used in our example. Suppose that Alpha finds that it can\nborrow money at rate equal to\n; thus, if LIBOR is 2.75%, the company will pay 3.0% to borrow.\nIf the company wants to borrow at a long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 5.0%.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLIBOR Transition\nAlthough the basic principles of financial transactions remain the same over time, the particular financial\ninstruments used change from time to time. Innovation, regulation, and technological advances lead to\nthese changes in financial instruments. The use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is winding down in the early\n2020s. To find out more about this transition and how it impacts companies, visit the About LIBOR\nTransition (https://openstax.org/r/About_LIBOR_Transition) website.\nBeta has a BBB bond rating. Although this is considered a good, investment-grade rating, it is lower than the\nrating of Alpha. Because Beta is less creditworthy and a bit riskier than Alpha, it will have to pay a higher\ninterest rate to borrow money. If Beta wants to borrow money at a floating rate, it will need to pay\nIf LIBOR is 2.75%, Beta must pay 3.5% on its floating rate debt. In order for Beta to borrow at\na long-term fixed rate, its cost of borrowing will be 6.75%.\nLet’s consider how these two companies can enter into a swap in which both parties benefit. Table 20.5\nsummarizes the situation and the rates at which Alpha and Beta can borrow. It also illustrates a way in which\nan interest rate swap can benefit both Alpha and Beta.\nAlpha\nBeta\nBond rating\nAAA\nBBB\nFloating rate\nFixed rate\n5\n6.75\nRate company chooses\nFixed at 5.0\nFloating at\nSwap\nN/A\nN/A\nBeta pays Alpha fixed rate\n5.5\n-5.5",

In essence, Beta is paying 5.5% to\nAlpha, 0.75% to its lender, and LIBOR to its lender.\nIn return, Alpha promises to pay Beta LIBOR. The exact amount that Alpha will pay to Beta fluctuates as LIBOR\nfluctuates. However, from Beta’s perspective, the payment of LIBOR it receives from Alpha exactly offsets the\npayment of LIBOR it makes to its lender. When LIBOR increases, the rate of\nthat Beta is\npaying to its lender increases, but the LIBOR rate it receives from Alpha also increases. When LIBOR decreases,\nBeta receives less from Alpha, but it also pays less to its lender. Because the LIBOR it receives from Alpha is\nexactly equal to the LIBOR it pays to its lender, Beta’s net amount of interest paid is 6.25%—the 5.5% it pays to\nAlpha plus the 0.75% it pays to its lender.\nAlpha is in the position of paying 5.0% to its lender and LIBOR to Beta while receiving 5.5% from Beta.

It would have cost Alpha\nto borrow the money from its lenders at a variable rate.\nBy participating in this swap arrangement, Alpha has been able to lower its interest rate by 0.75%.\nThrough this swap arrangement, Beta has been able to fix its interest rate at 6.25% rather than having a\nvariable rate. This predictability is a benefit for a company, especially one that is in a bit more precarious\nposition as far as its creditworthiness and stability. The 6.25% Beta pays as a result of this arrangement is 0.5%\nbelow the 6.75% it would have paid if it simply borrowed from its lenders at a fixed rate.\n20.4 • Interest Rate Risk\n617\nSummary\n20.1 The Importance of Risk Management\nRisk arises due to uncertainty. The future is unpredictable. One job of the financial manager is to manage the\nrisks of both cash inflows and cash outflows. Investors are risk-averse. The riskier a firm’s cash flows are, the\nhigher the rate of return investors require to provide capital to the company.\n20.2 Commodity Price Risk\nCompanies do not know how much they will have to pay for raw materials in future months. The price of raw\nmaterials will change as economic conditions change, impacting a company’s cost of goods sold and profits.\nSome ways that a company can hedge this risk are through vertical integration, long-term contracts, and\nfutures contracts.\n20.3 Exchange Rates and Risk\nExchange rates are unpredictable. This leads to transaction risk, translation risk, and economic risk as currency\nvalues change. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties to make an exchange at a particular\nrate on a given date in the future. Companies can use options to mitigate the risks. A call option gives the\nholder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset. A put option give the holder the right,\nbut not the obligation, to sell an underlying asset.\n20.4 Interest Rate Risk\nWhen interest rates increase, the present value of future cash flows decreases. Duration is a measure of\ninterest rate risk. A swap involves two parties agreeing to exchange something, often specified payment\nstreams.\nKey Terms\nAmerican option\nan option that the holder can exercise at any time up to and including the exercise date\nappreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it did previously\ncall option\nan option that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying asset at a\nspecified price on some future date\ndepreciate\nwhen one unit of a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it did previously\nderivative\na security that derives its value from another asset\nduration\na measure of interest rate risk\neconomic risk\nthe risk that a change in exchange rates will impact the number of customers a business has",
