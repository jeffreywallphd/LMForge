The average consumer had 5.1 of the nine instruments in 2008, and used 4.2 \ninstruments in a typical month. Consumers made 52.9 percent of their monthly payments with a \npayment card. More consumers now have debit cards than credit cards (80.2 percent versus 78.3 \npercent), and consumers use debit cards more often than cash, credit cards, or checks \nindividually. However, paper instruments are still popular and account for 36.5 percent of \nconsumer payments. Most consumers have used newer electronic payments at some point, but \nthese only account for 9.7 percent of consumer payments. Security and ease of use are the \ncharacteristics of payment instruments that consumers rate as most important. [1] \n \nAmericans still wrote some thirty billion checks in 2006. [2] You can readily imagine how complex the \nbank collection process must be to cope with such a flood of paper. Every check written must eventually \ncome back to the bank on which it is drawn, after first having been sent to the landlord, say, to pay rent, \nthen to the landlord’s bank, and from there through a series of intermediate banks and collection centers. \n \nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books \n \nSaylor.org \n \n \n940 \nTerminology \nTo trace the traditional check-collection process, it is necessary to understand the terminology used.

Two terms are used to describe the various banks that may handle \nthe check after it is written: collecting banks and intermediary banks. All banks that handle the check—\nexcept the payor bank—are collecting banks (including the depository \nbank); intermediary banks are all the collecting banks except the payor and depository banks.

For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for\nstudent reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the\nchapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7, 8, 9) and statistics (Chapters 14, 15, 16) problems. The\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making. Chapters 13 and 14\n(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about the R software\n(https://openstax.org/r/r-software) package to promote further interest in trends in data science.\nTeaching Plan Options\nPrinciples of Finance includes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts\nfrom prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters\non prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-\nsemester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend\nfocusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:\n1 Introduction to Finance\nCore\n2 Corporate Structure and Governance\nCore\n3 Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\nExtension\n4 Accrual Accounting Process\nExtension\nTable 1\n2\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n5 Financial Statements\nCore\n6 Measures of Financial Health\nCore\n7 Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\nCore",

The upward-sloping curve is the supply curve for\nsweatshirts. The equilibrium price will be $30. At a price of $30, the quantity demanded of 20 sweatshirts\nequals the quantity supplied of 20 sweatshirts.\nFigure 3.6 Graph of Demand and Supply for Sweatshirts\nChanges in Equilibrium Price\nA price that is either too high (above the equilibrium price) or too low (below the equilibrium price) is not\nsustainable in a competitive market. Market forces pull prices to the equilibrium, where they stay until either\nsupply or demand changes.\nIf supply increases and the curve moves outward to the right, as in Figure 3.7, then the equilibrium price will\nfall. With the original supply curve, Supply1, the equilibrium price was $15; quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied were both 30 pizzas at that price. If a new pizza restaurant opens, increasing the supply of pizzas to\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n73\nSupply2, the equilibrium will move from Equilibrium1\nto Equilibrium2\n. The new equilibrium price will\nbe $10. This new equilibrium is associated with a quantity demanded of 40 pizzas and a quantity supplied of 40\npizzas.\nFigure 3.7 Supply Curve Changes When Supply Increases An increase in supply leads to a lower equilibrium price and an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nIt is important to note that the demand curve in Figure 3.7 does not move. In other words, demand does not\nchange. As the equilibrium price falls, consumers move along the demand curve to a point with a combination\nof a lower price and a higher quantity. Economists call this movement an increase in quantity demanded.\nDistinguishing between an increase in quantity demanded (a movement along the demand curve) and an\nincrease in demand (a shift in the demand curve) is critical when analyzing market equilibriums.\nEquilibrium price will also fall if demand falls. Remember that a decrease in demand is represented as a shift\nof the demand curve inward to the left. In Figure 3.8, you can see how a decrease in demand causes a change\nfrom\nto\n.\nFigure 3.8 A Decrease in Demand\nAt the new equilibrium,\n, the price of a pizza is $10.

Show this movement in a graph. What happens to\nthe equilibrium? What are some reasons you can think of that may have caused this change in demand?\nSolution:\nThis is an increase in demand. At every price, consumers now want to purchase more sweatshirts than they\ndid before. This is shown in the graph as a movement of the demand curve outward to the right. Both the\nequilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity will rise because of this increase in demand. The equilibrium\nprice will now be $40, and the equilibrium quantity of sweatshirts will be 30. Note that there is not an\nincrease in supply; the supply curve does not move. There is simply an increase in quantity supplied (see\nFigure 3.9).\n3.1 • Microeconomics\n75\nFigure 3.9 Graph Showing Increase in Sweatshirt Supply\nA change in any of the factors that are assumed to be held constant under the ceteris paribus assumption\ncould have caused the demand curve to shift to the right. Perhaps a rise in consumers’ incomes led them to\npurchase more clothing, including sweatshirts. Or an unseasonably cool fall could result in more people\npurchasing sweatshirts. If a popular TV personality indicates that their favorite weekend wardrobe consists\nof jeans and a sweatshirt and the tabloids run pictures of the celebrity wearing sweatshirts, the tastes and\npreferences of consumers may change. Another possibility is that the price of sweaters may have risen,\ncausing people to substitute sweatshirts for sweaters.\n3.2\nMacroeconomics\nLearning Outcomes\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine inflation and describe historical trends in inflation.\n•\nDefine unemployment and describe how unemployment is measured.\n•\nDefine gross domestic product and describe historical trends in gross domestic product.\nInflation",

This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284\n10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nannually. However, if a bond pays interest on a semiannual or quarterly basis, the coupon rate will have to\nbe divided by 2 or 4, respectively, to convert the stated annual rate to the correct periodic rate. In our\nexample, coupons are paid annually, so the periodic or annual interest that is paid is equal to\n. You may notice that because these payments are the same amount and made at\nregular intervals, they constitute an annuity stream (refer to Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple\nPayments.\n•\nMaturity date: The maturity date is the expiration date of the bond, or the point in time when the term of\na bond comes to an end. On the maturity date, the issuer will make the final interest or coupon payment\non the bond and will also pay off its principal, or face value. In our example, the maturity date is at the end\nof the 20-year period.\n•\nYield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a\nbond into present value terms.

While\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,",

The issuer\nstates the rate as an annual rate, even though payments may be made more frequently.

We refer to such a bond as a discount bond.\n•\nWhen the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value.

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\nrate, and risk.\n10.2 Bond Valuation\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\npresent value of the coupons.\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\ntime periods on the x-axis.\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\nKey Terms\nbond call",

Figure 13.2 shows the mean and standard deviation for the 10 ages.\nFigure 13.2 Mean and Standard Deviation in Excel.\nRelationship between Standard Deviation and Variance\nIn the formulas shown above for variance and standard deviation, notice that the variance is the square of the\nstandard deviation, and the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\nOnce you have calculated one of these values, you can directly calculate the other value. For example, if you\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\n13.2 • Measures of Spread\n389\nOne disadvantage of using the variance is that the variance is measured in square units, which are different\nfrom the units in the data set. For example, if the data set consists of ages measured in years, then the\nvariance would be measured in years squared, which can be confusing. The standard deviation is measured in\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\n13.3\nMeasures of Position\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDefine and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\n•\nDefine and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\n•\nUse quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\nz-Scores",

The first two estimates are based\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%.

Accounts payable are normally paid within 30 days, so the forecast for cost of goods\nsold for the prior month is used as an estimate of amount paid for payables. For example, in Figure 18.16, we\nsee that the accounts payable settled in June of $8,610 is the cost of goods sold for May from the forecasted\nincome statement.\nSalaries are paid monthly and thus represent the same recurring monthly cash outflow, as does rent.

This identifies\nwhether a cash surplus (extra) or cash deficit (not enough) exists for each month. For example, in Figure\n18.17, we see that in March, Clear Lake is forecasting $4,800 of cash inflows and $17,800 of total cash outflows,\nwhich results in a cash deficit of $13,000.\nClear Lake has a general policy to not let its cash balance fall below $35,000. Thus, managers need to assess\ntheir monthly balances and potential deficits and identify months when financing is necessary. For example,\nthe deficit of $13,000 in March is enough to push the cash balance lower than $35,000. Thus, it’s estimated that\nthe company will need $5,000 in short-term financing in March.

For our example,\nlet’s assume the premium for the call option contract is KWN 50. In other words, the company has paid KWN\n50 for the right to buy US dollars in six months for a price of KWN 1,200/USD.\nIn six months, the company makes a choice to either (1) pay the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD or (2) let the\noption expire. If the company chooses to pay the strike price and purchase the US dollars, it is exercising the\noption. How does the company choose which to do? It simply compares the strike price of KWN 1,200/USD to\nthe market, or spot, exchange rate at the time the option is expiring.\nIf, six months from now, the spot exchange rate is\n, it will be cheaper for the company\nto buy the US dollars it needs at the spot price than it would be to buy the dollars with the option.

If the spot price is anything less than KWN 1,200/USD, the option\nexpires without being exercised.
