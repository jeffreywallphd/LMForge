The extent of permissible state regulation is not always easy to measure, but it is greater in matters traditionally of local concern."

Thus all \ncrimes resulting in injury to a person or property (murder, assault, arson, etc.) are also torts, and the \nplaintiff may bring a separate lawsuit to recover damages for injuries to his person, family, or property. \nMost tort suits do not rely on intentional fault.

An \nemployee went to Pickford and Company, a common carrier, and asked that the shaft be sent as quickly as \npossible to a Greenwich foundry that would use the shaft as a model to construct a new one. The carrier’s \nagent promised delivery within two days. But through an error the shaft was shipped by canal rather than \nby rail and did not arrive in Greenwich for seven days. The Hadleys sued Joseph Baxendale, managing \ndirector of Pickford, for the profits they lost because of the delay. In ordering a new trial, the Court of \nExchequer ruled that Baxendale was not liable because he had had no notice that the mill was stopped: \n \nWhere two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the damages which the \nother party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly",

If parties have an express partnership with no \npartnership agreement, the relevant law—the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) or the Revised Uniform \nPartnership Act (RUPA)—applies the governing rules. \n \nAssume that three persons have decided to form a partnership to run a car dealership.

The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a\nlittle under 27 years from 1972 to 1999.

We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\nLet’s look at an example.

Does it\nreflect any change in performance over time (earning more or less gross profit on its gross sales)?\nIncome from Operations\nGross profit is a very helpful measure, but it is only the first of several provided by the income statement. After\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses.

Changes in market value of big-\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and\ndepreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated\ndepreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen\non the balance sheet.\nEstimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for\ndoubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating\ndepreciation is another common estimate.

With future value, we begin investing immediately, so the result will\nbe larger than if we waited for a period to elapse. With present value, we begin extracting funds immediately\nrather than letting them work for us during the first year, so logically we would have to start with more.\nContinuing our example but converting it to an annuity due, we will multiply by one additional period, (1 + i).",

Before\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\nmonthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest\nrate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods",

This is equal\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\n•\nCoupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\n•\nCoupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\n284",

Because the stable growth\nrate is achieved in the second phase, after five years have passed, if we assume that the current year is 2021,\nwe can lay out the profile for this stock’s dividends through the year 2026, as per Figure 11.3.\n11.2 • Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\n329\nFigure 11.3 Profile of Stock Dividend through 2026\nStep 2:",

In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form",

It is\nnot uncommon for companies to issue preferred stock that has a conversion feature. Such conversion features\ngive preferred shareholders the right to convert to common shares after a predetermined period.\nA review of the characteristics of preferred stock will lead to the conclusion that the constant growth dividend\nmodel is an excellent approach for valuing such stock.

Often, the\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate.

                    "answer": "Inflation, according to the text, redistributes wealth by making lenders receive less-valuable dollars in return, making borrowers repay with the same less-valuable dollars, and causing workers to receive less-valuable dollars when their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven economy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However, too much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage increases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business investment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a fixed income."

The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of the\naverage. We will discuss the geometric mean later.\nNote that the words mean and average are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the\nother is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and average technically refers only to a\ncenter location. Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\nfor arithmetic mean.\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\nthen divide by the number of data values.\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data.
